+ Project summary: In this project, we created a shiny app to give recommendations on Broadway shows based on users' preference. We considered the following approaches to make the recommendations:
+  1. Synopsis Analysis
+  2. Sentimental Analysis
+  3. Characters' lyrics Analysis

+ The data: We scraped the lyrics, musical, reviews, synopsis, and pictures of the 450 off-broadway shows and 33 broadway shows from the following websites:

+ https://www.ibdb.com/
