"Fame Becomes Me" Synopsis - Broadway musical                                  
    Main inspirer of this musical, actor, writer and producer Martin Short, released it only for self-promotion. The same did many of the stars that would PRâed âemselves. The most striking example â Liza Minnelli, for whom was made The Act â full-bodied one-person theater stage, a benefit. The name of this musical is no obsessed with modesty. These two even have something unite â two actors on the covers of their offspring are in suits.

Show is to bring to the audience even more talent of this Canadian comedy actor, polishing it with Step Brother to Jesus or obscene Big Titties, only to reveal his remarkable talent.

Despite the almost complete benefit, except Martin Short, in this satirical musical, five more actors play. Martin displays on the stage his favorite characters: Grimley, Cohen, and Glick, among others, each of which has a unique character and behavior.

Most importantly, on what keeps the staging â a parody on the showbiz stars who allegedly interviewed by Martin Short: Celine Dion, Jodie Foster, Richard Burton, RenÃ©e Zellweger, Britney Spears, Ellen DeGeneres, Elizabeth Taylor, Rachael Ray with Katharine Hepburn & others. He also parodied his wife and himself. In the role of one of his characters, he interviewed them, giving rise to funny skits.
