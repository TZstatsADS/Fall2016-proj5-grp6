"Brooklyn" Synopsis - Broadway musical                                  
    The musical has small part of coherent narration and some digressions from the main theme. There is no rod, such as a single storyline.  Reception "game within the game" is used, as well as reception of "memories of the past, which complement the story of the present". So, we meet a group of slackers, bums that exist at the bottom of society, with the rats, aimless and pointless. Only occasionally they turn their corner of dullness and hopelessness into a kind of stage where they give all the passers-by and own "colleagues" kind of show, talking about a singer from France.

After the start of "playing the game", we understand that this is the Parisian French girl, the mother of whom hanged herself, and she never knew the father. One day she discovers own beautiful voice, which leads her to the heights of fame and glory. She becomes a star and now receives the ability to find her father. She decides to do it. All she knows about him â he lives in the USA, somewhere in Brooklyn (the same as this girlâs name). Arriving there, she met different personalities, helping her in finding him and eventually she finds. He is a drunker, former military, who passed the war in Vietnam and now ekes out a very miserable existence.

She leaves him and is involved in the vocal competition, which takes place at Madison Square Garden, with the involvement of the local opera diva. And that girl wins the competition and it gives her not only the sympathy of the audience, but also much fame and recognition.
