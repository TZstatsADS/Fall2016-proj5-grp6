All these people were in the collection of songs from different years, which can be played as by a professionals, but more often â as amateur singing, about which the "Video" chapter of this musical shows. Basically, all the music performed by piano and in a fairly rapid paces. They say about all those same aspects of everyday life â a variety of fears, among which dominate the fear of the new and of the future; the desire for self-realization and the rest of the vital issues that can gain popularity among the people. The disc with recordings with 23 tunes, is available in a variety of prices from $5 for used and up to 50 dollars for a new one. Among singles, there are such as: Unexpressed (Gavin Creel); Progression (John Bucchino); Grateful (Billy Porter), and others.

All songs are collected under such a bias to justify the name, "It's Only Life" â and tell about life and its manifestations, in a fairly relaxed atmosphere, without too bright emotions. Quiet plate, which you can listen during the bedtime.
