"My Name will always be Alice" Synopsis - Broadway musical                                  
    The show features songs and sketches performed by women of different ages and types in a wide variety of situations and relationships with insight, empathy and self deprecating humour.

Each of the five member cast "introduces" herself by reciting an adult update on the children's ABC rhyme. One example:

"A ... my name is Alice, 
And my husband's name is Adam, 
And his girlfriend's name is Amy, 
And my lover's name is Abby, 
And her husband's name is Arnie, 
And his boyfriend's name is Allan, 
And my analyst's name is Arthur, 
And we're working on my anger".
