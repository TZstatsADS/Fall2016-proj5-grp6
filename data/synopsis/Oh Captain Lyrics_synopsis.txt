After returning to the ship, the sailors asked the assistant, why he did not go with them. Manzoni said he did not wish to repeat his past mistakes.

But at the same time, women felt a certain bond with each other â they both have been deceived by the same person. 

The captain took refuge from the scandal on his ship.
