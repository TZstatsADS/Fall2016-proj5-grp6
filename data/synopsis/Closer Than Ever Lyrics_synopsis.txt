"Closer Than Ever" Synopsis - Broadway musical                                  
    This musical raises once again such eternal and not aging themes as marriage, growing up, divorce, love (including unrequited), a sense of security, a midlife crisis, and others. Its creators, Richard Maltby, Jr. and David Shire made this performance based on personal experience, at the stories they heard from their friends and fellows, as well as at the quintessence of all of their lives experience that can be used as the basis of a musical without a storyline. Adult actors, which are already over 40, with own expression can display experience not just based on the script, but passing through the prism of own attainments. That is why this musical involves qualified actors, not young, whose vividness have not yet reached the desired heights.

Musical lasting a little more than 2 hours received Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Off-Broadway Musical and its creators received nominations for the Drama Desk Award (however, none of them won). Events revolve around only four actors, which greatly reduces the production budget and allow it to be played at any level of compactness of scenes.
