    Action of the musical happens in the twenties. Mother and her two daughters, June and Louise, go on tour across America. Rose is very strict and exacting to girls. She forces them to act. Elder sister June is very beautiful and talented. Younger sister is very modest; therefore, she plays a supporting role of the boy-postman. She sings only one song all the time. 

Rose lays hopes on girls, but constantly faces with failures. Once she meets the agent and persuades him to become the manager for her daughters. She uses her charm and cunning. Time passes, the girls are already adult. June has an opportunity to act at Goldstone. Louise celebrates her birthday alone. The manager suggests Rose to marry him, but she refuses.

Louise plays the roles similar to Juneâs. On the one of performances, she attracts representatives of the burlesque house. Her mother is in despair, but Louise considers that it is better than practically not to have money. 

Herbie suggests Rose to leave the daughter and to begin the normal life. She doesnât agree with him. Before performance, Rose advises Louise that she shouldn't be undressed, she can simply tease a public. At first, the girl sings the song of her childhood. Then she takes off a glove.
