"Five Course Love" Synopsis - Broadway musical                                  
    There is no story line, there are several little plots intertwined closely, telling uncomplicated of how 15 people were looking for their soul mates, in a variety of restaurants. A story is featured to all these characters only by 3 actors. Events are holding at 5 various locations.

In one of them, the waitress seeks her love and wants to get a little help from Cupid in this aspiration. In another, the wife of a gangster, secretly from her husband, is having an affair with a beautiful admirer. In the third, some tough guys are eager for the hand of a beautiful girl, competing with each other in this. The fourth restaurant in Texas shows the audience a picture, where two are at a very unfortunate date, against a background of barbecue wings and legs. Fifth exhibits lovers, realizing one huge thing that wrecks their relationship.

Comedy & tragedy, but the first is more. There are even antagonistic confrontation between two diametrical, dissimilar characters â cowboy-wit joker, opened to the world and bespectacled miserable nerd (it is unclear what he is doing at the restaurant at the first place).

All the action takes place in snack bars and restaurants, so the interior of scenes changes. The viewer sees different ones: a refined Italian restaurant, a Mexican food eatery, Country & Western style, in which the main character is unrestrained cowboy, and a cafe, decorated in the style of the 50s.
