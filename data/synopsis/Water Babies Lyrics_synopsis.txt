    Young orphan Tom accidentally fell into the paws of the participants of a street gang, whose leader was Grimes. When the others were engaged in another robbery, the young man met with Ellie, the daughter of Sir John Hartover. Soon, the young man was detained. He was accused of committing a crime. Innocent Tom did not know how to prove in court that he was not involved in this robbery. Soon the young man fled. When the pursuers drove him to the top of the waterfall, the young man decided to take a desperate act and jumped down. Tom awoke in the depths of the ocean. Being dead from the fall, he was reborn as a Water Baby. Soon the young man met a fairy Mrs. D (Do-as-you-would-be-done-by). She began to give wise counsel to the youngling, but the teen was not listening to them much. Finding out that he had a chance to return to the shore, the young man started to search for the rest of Water Babies, who could help him.
