"A Spoof Odyssey" Synopsis - Broadway musical                                  
    This part of Forbidden Broadway came out in 2000 and is the next extension of this cycle of musicals, collected under a single already mentioned name. Their creator is named Gerard Alessandrini â who is also the author of the idea, producer, director & actor, choreographer and author of the music & the libretto. However, the libretto is almost absent â it's just a series of musical numbers that parody musicals, movies and songs â popular items at the time of the release of this creation. So, a list of parodied songs from musicals here includes: Trouble, Wunderbar, I Hate Men, Wilkommen, Buddy's Blues, Elaborate Lives, Let It Go, 76 Trombones, among others.

There is no plot; there is only a set of parodies, so it is not a musical in the classic sense of this word, this is a revue. Here we have 27 sequences of songs and parodied of such musicals: Kiss Me, Aida, Joseph, The Full Monty, Cabaret, Les MisÃ©rables, Mrs. Saigon, and such persons: Edith Piaf, Ben Brantley, Gwen Verdon, among others.
