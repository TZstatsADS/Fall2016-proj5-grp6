"Jennie" Synopsis - Broadway musical                                  
    It's pretty solemn story about several episodes from the lives of two actors, James O'Connor & Jennie Malone (stage names, for which prototypes were Laurette Taylor and J. Hartley Manners, her husband). The essence of the show is to show how these two drive across the USA, performing their melodramatic productions in cities of different sizes and cultural levels. In one of the pieces, she performs physical stunts â climbs up a tree, receives effusions from a waterfall. In the other â she transforms own finger into little bells, playing them in the Chinese style. In the third histrionics, she and her husband doing tap-dance.

Everything ends when she fleeing away from her husband, exchanging him for some kind of novelist, leaving behind grieving person with a broken heart.
