    The musical, which was placed on the professional scene in Chicago in 1979 and on Broadway in 1982, is a comedy that tells the story through a series of memories. History is about several people, where there is he and she who met in a Catholic school and felt love to each other. Now the girl has become a mother of quite adult daughter, and through a series of memories immerses the viewer into the story. Since memories are spread over time, the actors involved in each of these flashbacks, have different ages and may become younger or older.

The stories that the spectator sees, refer to the 1970's and 1980 years, in which there are major developments in some Chicagoland, a fictional city. Events tell about growing bunch of young people from elementary school till their senior prom in adolescent age. The process involves such topics as love, first enchantment, the protection of the saints and the issue of compulsory for girls to wear pants under skirts (hence the name of the musical, which is due to the fact that their patent-leather shoes may reflect the essence of what under their skirts, in favor of surrounding boys). Through the prism of humor, the standard things are shown, essential to the process of adulthood. One of the boys chooses his path to be a teacher-priest and returns as one at his old school, where he discovers that the girl he fell in love with while studying is here as a nun (they are parted because of this, despite the long, first a friendship between them and then, love).
