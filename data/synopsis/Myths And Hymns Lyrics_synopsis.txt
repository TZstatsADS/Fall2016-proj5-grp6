    An elderly woman was in the attic of her house. She did not want to see anyone â even her own daughter. She arrived to transport her mother to the house for the elders. A house was put up for sell, and soon it was going to be sold. But all attempts of her daughter to get into the attic were unsuccessful. Being in the old house again, a girl reminisces about deceased relatives â brother and father. At that time, her mother was looking at the boxes with the old stuff. She was also lost in visions of the past. The widow remembered all her life, starting with a happy acquaintanceship with her future husband. 

As a young girl, an elderly woman met a pious man who started care after her. After some time, they married. Soon the couple gave birth to a boy and a girl.

His pious father was shocked to find out his son's inclinations. He tried to influence him, using the Bible, but was unsuccessful â the fight against attractions of boy he lost. Having negative attitude to such love affairs, father moved the anger at his own child.

After some time father also passed away. It was the second hit for wife and daughter. A girl also experienced a lot of problems in her life. She could not maintain long-term relationships with own partners. Her unsuccessful love affairs poured in extramarital abortions. The fate of the daughter was highly disquieting for her mother.
