He arrives in clientâs castle, which is located on the lands of the former Transylvania, in the Carpathian Mountains, at the junction between Moldova, Romania and Ukraine, in Europe. This area is full of old legends, as mountains and splendid forests, of many millions square kilometers, is a wonderful haven not only for the lynxes, wild boars, wolves and bears, but also for evil spirits â vampires, ghouls and other inhabitants of the underworld. Count, who turns out to be a vampire, tries to persuade Jonathan to stay at his for the first month, then another, during which his henchmen â seductive vampire girls, drink his blood, weakening him without letting escape. Meanwhile, Count, in the guise of a young man (and not 80-years-old, as he appeared during a meeting with Jonathan), meets and begins dating the bride of Jonathan, a young Mina, waiting for Jonathanâs return from captivity of Count.
