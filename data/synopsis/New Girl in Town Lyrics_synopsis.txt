Girlfriend Marthy told him the news â his daughter is about to arrive. Man sent Anna at the age of 5 years to live with cousins in Minnesota. After that, he never saw her. A girl wrote that she works as a nurse. Marthy started to search for a daughter of Chris. Soon she saw a young woman who came into the bar and ordered a whiskey. Having learned that the battered person is 20-year-old Anna, Marthy was really surprised. Captain's daughter confessed â she was engaged in prostitution before and went to prison. After finding her illness, the girl was released. Anna became so because of the cousins, who, as erroneously thought Chris, she was safe to live with. 

Soon the girl's father came. Chris offered his daughter to swim with him on a barge to recover her strengths. He also asked Marthy to live separately, to make way for Anna. The woman was angry and hit the captain. On father's barge, Anna felt better. Soon the crew saved the shipwrecked people. Seeing the girl, a sailor Mat tried to kiss her. Anna slipped away from the sailor. After returning to the harbor, Mat has attracted the attention of journalists â he talked about his own salvation, constantly mentioning this girl.

Anna tried to explain to her beloved that she had changed, but he did not believe her. Upset girl left the ball. Gathering own stuff in the room of her father, the daughter told him about her past. Soon Chris floated away on a barge. When the girl came with a bag on the street, gardener Henry has spoken to her respectfully â he considered her a respectable lady. 

A year has passed. Anna lived and worked on a farm of Henry. Chris met Mat, who returned to the banks â he was going to sail away in a few hours.
