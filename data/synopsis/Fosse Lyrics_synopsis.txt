"Fosse" Synopsis - Broadway musical                                  
    This musical is a revue, compiled in its three acts of various dance numbers that are associated with Bob Fosse â perfect dancer, an outstanding choreographer, director, actor and screenwriter who has worked both in Broadway and in filming industry. He is distinguished by the fact that he had received 8 Tonies for choreography and 1 Oscar for his phenomenally beautiful Cabaret (and nominated for the latter-mentioned award four times) for his 60-yearsâ life.

The musical includes 27 music + dance numbers, divided onto 9, 8, and 10 parts in each act, respectively. Each of them has, of course, its own style. For example, from the interesting Shoeless Joe Ballet (which is a clip from one of his films), where the frame contained a crowd of baseball players dancing with a woman in a blue dress, to the Rich Man's Frug, where little black dress in sequins is the main enticing part in a style of movie and cartoon called The Pink Panther. Ballets of all staging numbers are of varying quantities as well, from a few up to almost 30 people â the whole cast. Choreography is made by Richard Maltby, Jr., among others. The other two are its creators A. Reinking & C. Walker â first was his partner till the death and second was his friend.
