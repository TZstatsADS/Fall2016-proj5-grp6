"Quilters" Synopsis - Broadway musical                                  
    Sarah is a mature woman, for a many years living in remote areas of the Wild West. She has recently lost her husband. The widow decided to make a crazy quilt. Six other women â her daughters â joined to help Sarah. During sewing each piece of fabric, they began to tell stories from the life of the first American pioneers. Memories about a house where Sarah was born, and very green lawns surrounding the white building, once again came to the courageous widow. She then spoke about her move to distant lands, where it was possible to understand freedom. Working tirelessly, the woman lived in a new place for more than 25 years already. By this time, she gave birth to many children. But not all of them were destined to survive. Good neighbors always came to the aid of each other and built homes together. Difficult life forced a pregnant woman to be worried about the birth of her twelfth child. A mother told about her children and about their favorite lullaby. Another piece of cloth recalled that it used to be a wedding dress of one of the seamstresses. Another woman told how her father built a mill. Many tests â from tornadoes to fire â settlers had to overcome. Stitch by stitch followed, and soon the hard-working women have finished sewing a quilt. It was collected from the life stories of courageous pioneers. Now everyone could learn about their difficult struggle, looking at the large canvas.
