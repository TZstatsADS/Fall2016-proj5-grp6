"Act, The" Synopsis - Broadway musical                                  
    The heroine of Liza Minnelli in this musical experiences a great loss â the loss of her marriage. Yes, may it be that her husband was quite a huge cattle and did not appreciate her and did not love (and blah-blah and all that stuff, that is totally justifies her in the eyes of the audience, why she had really important reason to hate her past life). In general, she abandons him, and does not pay attention to all those gifts, which he sends her (the fruit baskets and gifts). One day she comes home, full of thoughts that it is time to have to change her melancholic mood for something really different and cheerful. And anyway, it's time to change her life and lead a new one without the ghosts of past husbands. Find herself a new man. And now she stands at her cold and lifeless kitchen, drinking and smoking. And she looks for what she has in drawers. And there is an old photograph that dusts more than one week. She takes it out of the frame, as if taking it out of her mind, and out of her life along with it.

The story further tells how a certain singer, played by Liza Minnelli, shines with her talent, is trying to restore her former glory and popularity. Pure dance and music performance with the inevitable happy ending.
