Ernest, as it turns out, is the adopted son â his parents adopted him, found in a wheelchair at the stadium, where he was picked up, and raised him. Strict mother of his girl, whom he dates, doesnât want him to married her daughter, because he is, in hers opinion, is adoptee & so he does not have any rights. His friend Algernon is very different, with which everyone is familiar after his arrival â he is considered a true gentleman. And since he did not come alone, but in the company of his mother, latter spots foster mother of Ernest, because she saw her in the day when she left the carriage with a small child in the stadium. And so it appears that these two â not just friends, but also brothers. Ernest, as it turns out, has the blood of secular society and the mother of his girl grants consent to their marriage.
