At the same time, there is a new student named Jason Dean, or, as he is called, JD. Father of Dean is an owner of a large construction company, and that is why the boy often dislocates. They are introduced with Veronica on the way home, when she is upset that she had to betray her friend and the guy just got hits from Ram and his friend Kurt Kelly.

And all would do, but a wave of gossips runs the school: it turns out that even the most popular girl can be deeply unhappy at heart, and none of them did even know. All students now recall Chandler only as a good and clever girl, which causes Sawyer and Dean to smirk. After the tragic event with Chandler, McNamara calls Sawyer for a meeting with Sweeney and Kelly, but it fails because the guys get drunk so much that she is forced to leave. In the morning, the school corridors resound news that Sawyer had a perverse sexual relationship with two guys at the same time.

A guy reveals that he is also great in forged handwriting, and the next suicide may be a suicide of Veronica Sawyer. That same night, Dean gets to the house of Veronica, but finds her hanging in a loop with a suicide note. He rejoices and says aloud a brilliant plan: he would make the whole school to sign a petition for the arrival of a rock band, to be able to forge their handwriting, and then the whole school would have committed suicide on the same day, from a bomb in the basement. He thought this plan was genius.
