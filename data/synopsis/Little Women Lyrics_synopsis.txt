Jo does not understand the reasons for such skeptical attitude toward her creation. She decides to seek help from another guest of inn-house of where she stays â Professor Bhaer. Last one not experiences much pleasure from reading the work of the protagonist. Bhaer makes girl a remark about the presence of too much cruelty in her work. The professor is confident that Jo is able to create something much better. But this woman isnât happy with such an answer. He was very angry & asked a man, that he has no right to judge her. Bhaer quite calmly reacted & said Jo that he only expressed his opinion that she needed to hear so much. 

Once left alone, Josephine asked herself same question: does all stories of her are like this? But then she recalled past life in Massachusetts. She considers that maybe works of that time were better for the public. This might be logical because in those works, the impact of the civil war, its cruelty & violence, practically wasnât felt.
