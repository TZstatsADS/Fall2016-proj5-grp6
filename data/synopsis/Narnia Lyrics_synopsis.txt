It says that four people would overcome the evil White Witch & would become the legitimate rulers of the country. Mr. Beaver said â the inhabitants of Narnia were expecting the imminent return of the true King, Aslan. When children with beaver went to the returned ruler, they met Father Christmas, who presented them with gifts. Many residents of fairyland noted that witchcraft of White Witch has weakened.
