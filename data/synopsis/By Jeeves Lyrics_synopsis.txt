"By Jeeves" Synopsis - Broadway musical                                  
    The musical is filled with a thin (one might even say â the thinnest) English humor (funny only to the British, if to express it in a few words), telling of the adventures of a nobleman â the actor who amuse the audience with his stories. Originally, he plays the banjo, but after it has broken, he sends his servant after the strings, who is named Jeeves and who tipped him to tell the stories that he starts to do.

Jeeves is far more clever and intelligent man than his master â actor, Bertie Wooster. The latter is narrow-minded and easy-going, wasting his family's money rather carelessly and everything in him that is charming â he is talkative and has manners. Bertie tells the audience about his adventures in the highest circles of British society, and how they were tightened and ended. For example, one of his stories is that he twirled an affair with a very blunt representative of high society, which has led to the fact that he has been took for the other person and it has been linked to many adventures.

Toward the end of the show, the main character is dressed in something akin to Elvis and arranges clumsy parody of him. Then his musical instrument, banjo, is found with a full set of strings, and he plays on it, while all are dressed as fairy tale characters from Wizard of Oz.
