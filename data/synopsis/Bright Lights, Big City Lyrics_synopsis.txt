    Jamie, a young man from the province, comes in a large New York City to become a writer, he dreamed for a long time. In the process of settlement in a new place, he finds temporary work, which is terribly boring (for him), and his boss is not a talkative woman. His duties are to re-examine the facts in the articles before they are published in the journal â monotonous and routine job. It is very different from the nature of Jamie.

Because of his addiction, he loses a job, albeit boring, but still bringing him sustenance.

Thanks to her, he began to climb out of the quagmire into which sank, got acquainted with the drugs. He restored all that could â the relationship with his brother and sat down to write his novel, which he started a bit. His wife did not return, but she didnât has to â he's happy with his new relationship.
