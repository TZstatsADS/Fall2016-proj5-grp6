"Bring In 'Da Noise, Bring In 'Da Funk" Synopsis - Broadway musical                                  
    A musical with a rather long name Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk were staged in different places â on Broadway and in New York. The main element in it is a tap dance and the use of folk instruments of sound producing. So very folk, that they are unlikely tools anymore â pots, pans and colanders.

The musical has several not very interconnected parts that tell fragmentary stories, from the period of an epidemic spread of black slavery, to the period of modern presidents (at least as modern as it was in 1995).

As such, there is no plot. There are just little stories that are given through the prism of dance and movements. Most part of the stories is not very deep â because it is not the essence of this work. Creation on stage differs only with dance, folk music and a lot of energy. The audience saw how actors dancing tap to the sounds of funk, when the whole scene can be completely wordless and filled with only the hits of drumsticks on cooking kitchenware. Almost 10 minutes, for example, takes the scene where 4 people unsuccessfully try to catch a taxi, accompanying this with the tap dance. Why not any taxi stops to pick them up? Perhaps the creators wanted to input a visual picture of discrimination based on skin color. Most of all, it is, âcause it is about it.
