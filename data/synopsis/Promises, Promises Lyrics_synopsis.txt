The subject of his lamentation was Fran, working as a waitress in the cafeteria of insurance company, where Chuck worked.

After some time, the boss of the insurance company paid attention to the rave reviews of the work of Chuck. Managers thus were fulfilling their part of the agreement. But instead of to advance Chuck's career, boss begins to find out the lowdown and learns about the apartment. Of course, he also wants to take advantage of an excellent opportunity because he had a mistress too. The irony of the situation is that this mistress is a secret love of Chuck.
