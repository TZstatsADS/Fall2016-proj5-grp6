They heard the voice that sang a charming song "Brigadoon" and went to it, came to the village with the same name. The voice belonged to a young girl that sang it in response to a question, when she will marry, that her friends asked. She said she is waiting for the right person. While her younger sister is just about to get married and the father goes to town to buy supplies for the upcoming event. 

Two newcomers stay in a local hotel and one of them really liked by the local milkmaid, who immediately spots him. Then they go on a picnic in the woods, but he rejects her claim without expressing the desire to become her boyfriend.

Due to some strong magic, this wish has come true, but in a peculiar way â the city was gone from the real world and returns just for 1 day every century. During this day, anyone can enter, but none of its inhabitants can get out of it, otherwise the city will be gone forever.
