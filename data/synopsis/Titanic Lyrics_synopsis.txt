However, the captain insists on previously planned course because it is safe for the liner. The chairman proposes to speed-up, although stokers & a whole crew disagree with this decision.

The owner of the company, the captain & officers are arguing about whose fault is in imminent catastrophe. It was decided to save only the women & children in the boats, for men they simply didnât have space.
