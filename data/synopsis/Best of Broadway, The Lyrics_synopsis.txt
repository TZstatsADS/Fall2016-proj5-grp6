"Best of Broadway, The" Synopsis - Broadway musical                                  
    This site contains a collection of the best songs (with dance numbers), which sounded in the Broadway musicals for all times. Many, many of the best and just great actors and singers took part in this, and we even try to list them: Sandy Duncan, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Barbra Streisand, Steve Martin, Ethel Merman, Mel Brooks, Mary Martin, Paul Goddard, Mickey Rooney, Liza Minnelli, Taylor Thomas, Jim Carrey, Judy Garland, Michael Bennett, Bob Fosse, Nathan Lane, Kathy Bates, Matthew Broderick, Brittany Byrnes, Jerome Robbins, Roger Bart, James Woods, Anne Hathaway, Julie Andrews, Joel Grey, Robin Williams, James Earl Jones, Lauren Bacall, Robert Morse, Jerry Orbach & Erik von Detten.

This collection of the best numbers delights with its selection and implementation. Here you will find lush There's No Business Like Show Business (from Annie Get Your Gun), playful with a fantastically clear voice You're The Top (from Anything Goes), Luck Be A Lady (from Guys and Dolls), performed by the sensual voice of Audrey Hepburn I Could Have Danced All Night (from My Fair Lady), enchanting and soulful My Favorite Things (by Julie Andrews), a bright Cabaret (by Liza Minnelli, who is loved by theater-goers), a little sad, but the phenomenal and sensational One (from a Chorus Line), immensely sad Memory (from imperishable Cats) and devilishly delicious The Music Of The Night (from the Phantom of The Opera) with amazing long note at the end that extends beyond human capabilities, and a snack would be foolish Good Morning Baltimore (from The Hair Spray).
