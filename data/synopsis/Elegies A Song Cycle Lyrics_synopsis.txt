"Elegies: A Song Cycle" Synopsis - Broadway musical                                  
    Author William Finn wrote a series of songs to honor the memory of his colleagues, friends and relatives who died in the fire at 9/11 of a terrorist act in the United States, as one part. The other is about loss due to normal death, of illness. These songs are full of mental suffering, melancholy and expectation that everything is for the better. The premiere of the songs series took place in 2003 at the Lincoln Center and has been exhibited since for many times. The most notable performances continued until 2010, including New York, Great Britain, Massachusetts, Toronto and several other places. Not professional performances were held in other cities. What is noteworthy in this creation â it is not necessary to prepare the special acting or to study a libretto. Here important only a presentation of the song with some interesting acting and in parallel, with respect to the original idea. For example, it includes 23 songs, some of which entered the final collection, which was released by Fynsworth Alley.

Some songs were also written by Finn in the memory of those of his friends that died from diseases such as AIDS. Three more songs dedicated to his mother, also passed. When this staging first saw the world, it had 18 songs, five of which complemented the cycle, creating an atmosphere of compassion for the victims of the terrorist attack. Despite the fact that all of them sung about those who are no longer with us, the general mood is created sublime, cheerful, even reassuring. That's certainly how gone people wouldnât like so others grieved over them, but all the good that they created in life be remembered.
