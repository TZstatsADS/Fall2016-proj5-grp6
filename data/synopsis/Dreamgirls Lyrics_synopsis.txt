Producer deals with one in the past big celebrity, who now experiences a decline that he should hire a band them to be on his back vocals. Their first joint show turns successful, but at the same time, this elderly star experiences a desperate shortage of new materials, performing songs of RânâB and soul styles. Producer of a band persuaded him and his agent that it's time to forget about his old fans in these genres and to begin to move on a new path, in the genre of pop. They agree, and gradually their cooperation with a band begins to pace up.

A few months later, a band of the trio is quite famed and, as a result, some quarrels related to the fact that someone from the creative company trying to win all the covers of the management of the main singer and a band vocals, so their co-operation falls apart. Producer starts dating the main soloist of a band, but after a while, offers the other to become a lead soloist by shifting existing one onto background.

With his brother, who previously wrote and still writes songs for the band, she decides to record his song, banned by producer of a band and to release it as own solo hit. It turns out so, and a new song starts to conquer the charts. Producer, not wanting to admit that the former member of the band may eclipse with own career the creativity of the band, bribes DJs all over the country to spin up artificially his brand new song, and to drop down the song of his rival. After the members learn about his misconduct, they quarrel with him & threatened to sue. He agrees to return everything back, signing a deal with them. Soloist learns that the child of former one is from her husband, so decides to leave him and to start a career as an actress, as she wanted for a long time.
