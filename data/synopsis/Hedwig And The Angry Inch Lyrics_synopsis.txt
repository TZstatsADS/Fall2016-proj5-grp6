His mother helps the son to change a name, makes him a passport & finds the doctor, who carries out an operation on a gender change. The surgeon intervention goes unsuccessfully, having left our fellow (known as Hedwig or Jadwiga) with a centimetric shoot between his legs â "ill-fated inch" that, however, hasn't prevented him from marriage.
