    May 1853. In the wild Californian countryside old miner Ben held impromptu funeral of his friend. Soon, his 16-year-old daughter Jennifer discovered gold dust in the mud. Ben staked a plot to mine and got the documents on it. After that, in the newly formed city of Rumson (Benâs family name) prospectors began to arrive. After 2 months, its population was 400 people. All residents of the city were men, and only young Jennifer was an exception. Geologist Jake was waiting when he would be able to save enough money to send for his wife & her girls Fandango, who performed the cancan to entertain the locals. His task was to construct a building for them, Music Hall. Jennifer felt uncomfortable in the city because of the large number of suitors. Julio Valveras brought laundry in Rumson â he lived outside the settlement, because he was Mexican. Soon, the young and handsome prospector Julio met with Jennifer.
