"Christmas Carol, A" Synopsis - Broadway musical                                  
    The good old fairy tale about the spirits of Christmas, which comes to Ebenezer Scrooge â miser, on behalf of which was even Scrooge McDuck named, as the personification of causeless, avaricious greed only for gaining money.
