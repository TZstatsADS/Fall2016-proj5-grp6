"First Date" Synopsis - Broadway musical                                  
    When tightly wound Aaron is set up with cool girl Casey, a quick drink turns into a hilarious dinner served with sides of Google background checks, fake emergency phone calls, a slew of bad boy and uptown girl exes, and some seriously saucy chemistry. Can this mismatched pair turn what could be a dining disaster into something special before the check arrives, or end up at another table for one?
