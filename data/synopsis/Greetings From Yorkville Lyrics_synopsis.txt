"Greetings From Yorkville" Synopsis - Broadway musical                                  
    As such, there is no storyline here, because how a real life can be called a story? A pair of Manhattanâs neighborhoods named Yorkville tells the story of the thorny path to conquer New York. They grab every straw, whether it is a lyrics or writing music for Broadway productions.

Their union is a wonderful example of mutual understanding and partnership in all sectors. They live on the money that have earned on temporary works and moonlights, and in the spare time they realize own dreams and write songs. First â for other musicals, but after a while, they decided on a more personal project: to record their own project and to run it in a cabaret style.

The work of these two was a success, even New York Times enthusiastically spoke about them, but it did not help to attract more new beholders. Colossal work, love, passion and love once more for their work, along with ardent belief in success and confident steps towards the dream â that's what they show on the stage.

A whirlpool path from the Midwest to New York, overcoming the obstacles, showing the strength of spirit and this ease, with which Anya and Robert cope with everything to touch their star, captivates the viewer and forces along with the characters to smile or to wince excitedly at the sharp turns of their lives.
