She, of course, is not happy with such replacement, steals Lola and takes her back in Copacabana, from where she came. But instead of killing her, or to do with her anything else, Conchita gets to like her, because she, to some extent, also a victim, like Conchita, who suffers a bad attitude on the part of her mafia friend only because that he allowed her to become the star of the show.
