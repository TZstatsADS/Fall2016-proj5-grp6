"Forbidden Broadway Goes to Rehab" Synopsis - Broadway musical                                  
    This part of the show named Forbidden Broadway is the eighteenth part of productions by this man â Gerard Alessandrini, who did this child â this performance â as an essence and work of his life. Running as of today for more than 32 years, this off-Broadway show has made a record of its kind for the duration of shows and soon there will be no even medium and small cities in the US left, where this show wasnât coming yet to do its staging, because currently there are more than 200 (places that this piece already have visited).

The essence of the show, which consists of 21 different versions, is ridiculing and parodying numbers and entire shows of Broadway, off-Broadway, movies, songs, and the whole show business. During all its stay on the stage, it has parodied more than 300 spectacles, songs and personalities. A feature of each part is that the author â Gerard Alessandrini â constantly updates repertoire; parts of a show that became irrelevant, are thrown away and new trends are included. So be sure that, if on Broadway is staged something worthy of attention, then after a couple of months, it is likely that some part of it will fall into this show and you will marvel or just laugh of witty display.
