He tried to make the actress help him in finding the Leagueâs supporters, but Marguerite refused to cooperate with the officer. Soon Percy knew about their meeting. Now he was sure that his wife cannot be trusted. & yet, the man continued to secretly love Marguerite.

Soon, Percy & his friends were invited to the royal palace. Nobles persuaded the Prince that their trips to France only needed to buy laces & having entertainment. In such way, they avoided the suspicion of involvement in the League. Chauvelin once again came to Marguerite. He told the actress that her brother was arrested as a member of the League & he could face the death penalty. The officer demanded that the woman exposed the Scarlet. Otherwise Armand would die. At the Royal ball, Marguerite asked her friend Percy to arrange a meeting with the Scarlet.

Suddenly, Armand helped Marguerite to get out of the jail. When they went on membersâ of the League meeting, they exposed a place to Chauvelin, who organized Margueriteâs escape to follow her. Marguerite learned the secret of her husband. Percy struggled with the officer at swords & lost him. Soon the head of the Englishman was cut down on a guillotine. Chauvelin sent troops to report on the execution of the Scarlet. Surprisingly, it was found out that Percy was alive â on the scaffold was his wax replica.
