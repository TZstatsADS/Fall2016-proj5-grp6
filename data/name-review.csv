"1","A Day in Hollywood   A Night in the Ukraine ","    One of the main actors of one of the parts painfully similar to â¦ wait for it, wait for it ... a legendary guy who wrote a bible of best friend â Barney Stinson from ""How I Met Your Mother"" TV serial movie. Just look at him in the song I Love A Film ClichÃ© â resemblance immediately become apparent to you. The voice is also the British, though without the same infinite charm., , To say that this musical is very musical â will be the same clichÃ©. After all, they are to tell the public about something, in the style of singing, but there is a whole musical quite strange. Here the songs â sung by very good voices â are interspersed with a stand-up comedian shows. It turns out something like this â every actor that comes on stage (well, at least in the second part), starts to sing first, and then tells something funny. Either (s)he first says something funny, and then sings. Sometimes they manage to do it all together, interrupting the singing with joking, or suddenly starting to sing while making a joke. In general, the public fell in love with this style of performance, while almost as many as 600 shows (well, ok, 588 if you keep up the accuracy in everything), this musical has held on the stage., , The essence of what is happening on the stage â is obviously to tell a lot of small and almost independent stories. In some of them, there is an interesting plot. In the others â there is only a slight hint on anything interesting (for example, if we talk about the history of the first piece of a scene that called It All Comes Out of the Piano)., , The first part of this musical is an attempt to combine the tap dancing with singing and with an interesting narration. The second part is, among everything else, an attempt to show the most authentic clothes of Ukrainian people, not having enough thoughtful study of actual national trend in clothing. So many of the elements were lost. But many were reflected. In fact, it is unclear until the end why this musical has decided to combine these different parts, which could easily be as separate musicals (and in life, they are different works actually)., , Tap dance lovers will be happy with at least the first part, where this dance takes probably at least one hour of total time. If this happens without any musical accompaniment (which is quite nice and created by Frank Lazarus), it does not look good, frankly. They are not second Michael Flatleys nor outstanding singers. Choreography is frankly messy â if we talk from the perspective of lover of musicals and a person who has seen more than a couple dozens of them. Musical makes a lot of flaws, on which you can close your eyes, because the second part becomes the better than first one (literally in everything: music, humor, histories, plots) and covers all the bad things., , It's hard to believe that between the parts of one whole there may be such a big difference, but it is a reality. Tangible advantage you can feel this one â the impression that for the price of one ticket you have been on two different shows this evening."
"2","A Spoof Odyssey ","    Critics have called it one of the most successful sequences of songs among Forbidden Broadway cycle (at least, at the time when there were only 11 pieces of one, among which this was the last)., , As usual, there is nothing forbidden for this offâBroadway miracle that allows itself to parody the musicals of the first magnitude, and well-known actors, many of which were included in the cohort of celebrities. At the time of doing this review, this musical has already given its last performance in 2014, but this particular part was exhibited in 2000 and lasted until 2001, winning the Drama Desk Award. Moreover, in addition to direct habitat place â Off-Broadway â the show wheeled on the US territory, giving dozens of performances and by thus, greatly prepared a fertile ground for the emergence of the next part, named 20th Anniversary Celebration, which was launched in 2011, just a couple of months after the end of A Spoof Odyssey, this piece., , In a series of the show, this is 11th part (exactly in the middle of all 21 versions). Also, an album of music has been recorded on a CD, which incorporates not only some of twenty-eight songs that were specifically in this version, but also some couple of songs that have been accumulated by that time from other shows. Next histrionics came out four years later, with the next largest incarnation, Special Victims Unit, which was preceded by yet another significant release in the cycle â Rude Awakening, 2008., , This part focuses not so much on the parody of the other shows, as on Broadway itself, as a big moneymaking business â There's No Business Like Show Business, as an example of the title song. This song clearly characterizes the mood of this entire collection, a plentiful list of gags, humorousness, fun and good mood. Here are irrepressible comparison between the Americans and the British, in the royal style of Judi Dench, full of charm. However, few new musicals were staging between the last part of Forbidden Broadway and the current one, so little as flying ferrets on Wall Street, so the Forbidden Broadway this time was forced to focus on the Broadway playsâ behind-the-scenes things that happen during the preparation of histrionics for public. That is, you can see a lot of gags, in which the actors parody themselves, their directors and the entire creative process., , Beauty With The Least â a parody of the budget cutoffs when length of the play is shortened or part of the cast is truncated to meet the saving plan purposes â this often happens when some show on Broadway does not do as well as it planned at its start. Ben Brantley, who worked as the chief critic for The New York Times, is a part of an interesting parody that consider the role of critics as such in the success or failure of any a show (I Hate Ben â the name of the song expresses the full irritation of the actors by the critics). Christine Pedi, who performs this melody, seems so natural in her way when creating new identities during displaying any person."
"3","Ace ","    The plot is quite tensed â something that catches your eye from the very beginning. Looking ahead, we say that if you have not had a chance to get acquainted with the performance of this musical in the years, when it was played on the stage between 2006 and 2008, so now, after another 7 years, you again had such a fantastic opportunity. Because this musical, rethought and rewritten much, was featured in the Judy Bayley Theatre â UNLV. Its start was in August this year, for which all cast were actively preparing, as it was the worldâs premiere, August 22nd and 23rd, 2015 (prepared by Nevada Conservatory Theatre, NCT)., , The two main actors, who were now invited to the roles of the father and son, are completely different people. One is tall and trim, with a haircut like a clerk or a stock exchange broker on Wall Street, and dressed in an elegant suit. The second is low and with a haircut like the star of the school, the most popular guy, much broader in the shoulders and in general, is a typical ""Shawn"", which you imagine when someone says that name. While the first one is a typical ""David"". , , Of course, if you did not have time for these only two shows (as it turns out, they do not plan to show any longer) with a very affordable price of USD 30 for 1 ticket, you can only read reviews in the newspapers or Internet. Or to watch some records on YouTube, because even a DVD you cannot buy â there were no records from the show., , In terms of popularity, this musical is rather a normal event on the musical sky than something outstanding, for example, as The Lion King is. Here, the main emphasis on the storyline that for those who come for the first time, seems strong enough. It goes like crossing the three generations and we become spectators of some temporary time funnel, which is revealed to us through diaries of mother, Elizabeth, of a little boy Danny. In the story, now she is dying, but in the past two versions of production, she remained alive, and in the end, they reunited with her son, adding bright colors to what was happening and to strengthen our faith in happy endings. Now, the creators (of which the most influential is only R. Oberacker), decided to go another way, thinking that Thanatos will influence the minds of the audience more, whose heavy hand of fate will fall on one of the heroes. Maybe that's why the story in general, is now more severe and gloomy than in the previous two productions., , Besides of completely updated cast, the creators decided not to delight us with the hope that the audience will see new productions of this action. Therefore, if you missed the time to see this musical 7-9 years ago and a few months ago also, now you will not catch up the missed."
"4","Across the Universe ","    This film is a musical, which was released not for the stage but as a film in 2007. Despite the fact that it was assumed that it would gather around it a great number of admirers of musical creativity of The Beatles, it turned out that it had received full failure. Net loss amounted to slightly more than USD 40 million (with a budget of USD 70.8 million, it managed to gross in the box office only USD 29.4 million)., , On the other hand, this film suggests another look at the things that took place during the Vietnam War, which widely finds echoes even now, decades after its completion, in the work of millions of people. Especially those, who resides in USA. For Americans accustomed to winning, the fact that this war was not officially won, is upsetting. It was just stopped when it became apparent that it brings greater turmoil within the country than the administration of the country would win in case of victory. Anyway, the objectives have been achieved and the ""flower children"" received great satisfaction that behind them now is their personal victory in the form of an ending of violence., , Musical tells the story of several months with pretty broad strokes, which takes place between several young people on the background of war and love. A very large variety of songs by The Beatles, which are used here, were cutely incorporated into the plot. We didnât dare to suggest that a reference of the viewer to Strawberry Fields Forever will be performed in the film not with only physically nailed strawberries to a board, but also at several locations during the film â for example, when aunt mentions cranberry sauce., , This film is a reminder of the huge culture, created and supported by The Beatles (and which is now supported by the last surviving member of the band). Culture, which has gone far beyond a single band, city, country or continent. Culture, which has combined in itself more than one musical band, and more than a million of people. About 100 or even a thousand times more. The Beatles is still the most popular band in the world, and their records are still sold with millions of copies (they have the largest number of singles and albums sold among all other musical groups or artists of the world)., , Voices singing in this musical, chosen really like the Liverpoolâs Four. Arrangement of songs is admirable. The ability to make the imposition of one song to another should also be considered as good. Especially in a scene Across The Universe, when the protagonist, leaving the subway, sings one thing, and then come the cries ""Strike, Strike!.."" And at this time a song superimposed, performed by female vocals, in a completely different style and direction. Actually, this is the moment when all arrested and this reflected quite emotionally. Police in this musical always dissipate and beats-up somebody. In general, they appear as lackeys of the government that is â punishing body â not one that should defend the interests of society, that is, citizens."
"5","Act","    This magnificent play at Broadway was directed by Martin Scorsese. In addition, during the preliminary plays out of the city (read it as â off-Broadway) to save the performances, which often were disrupted because of the enormous hostility of cast to a leading actress, Gower Champion was invited to handle all this. His work did not help and in fact, it did not have the desired effect, and in addition he wasnât listed as director, although for a long time he was doing its job., , Judging even by just photos, all of them have Minnelli in the foreground. All the rest are on the second stage. And even being somewhere close, but still there is a serious wall between them percepted, and Liza, who, as if the piranha, greedy takes herself all pieces. With all her as if saying ""look at me, only I'm the best"". In general, this musical is a big, solid, and ongoing benefit of one actress. Only the costumes were a huge part of her game that she happily acted. The story, the music and the other actors â all these were at the secondary ground. Everything is in order to allow Minnelli shine as much as possible, as a shooting star. Critics spat this musical to the fullest. Everything was surrounded with criticism â from the plot to the music and from the costumes to the mood, with which main actress played, along with all accompanying actors â ones strove at every opportunity to disrupt a musical and not to go on the stage. Despite this, she is an example of self-made woman, and won a Tony Award for the fact that the audience loved her, never mind the disastrous musical performance. Those who sits in the jury of such institutions that organize regular giveaways of awards and nominations and assess the extent to which someone is worthy or go to oblivion â these people loved her., , The plot is quite thin â Minnelli plays a singer who hasnât been singing for a long time and is trying to regain lost grounds. Thatâs it. This is a complete summary of the plot. We neither had to reduce artificially the summary nor try to make it thinner anyhow. All this is very swollen and smeared on screening time, which Liza seeks to fill with her., , If critics were less restrained in presenting their thoughts for fear of hurting inadvertently or offend someone, particularly the provincial singer Liza Minnelli, so they would tell the whole truth, not hiding behind the grandiloquent duality of own literacy, directly accusing main culprit in the failure of this musical â Liza Minnelli. Instead of blaming the musicians, actors, directors or someone else there. The audience had about the same reaction to this piece, as well as from the audience in the movie ""Death Becomes Her"" with Bruce Willis, Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn. When in the beginning, it is a disastrous musical showing, in which the heroine played by Meryl Streep and spectators begin to leave the room, swearing about loosely bought tickets., , Maybe paints are little exaggerated, but it may be that not â who can tell for sure soon after half a century, what really was happening backstages in 1977?"
"6","Addams Family","    Barry Sonnenfeld, who made the film in 1991 (and which not incidentally has collected a huge cash box in USD 192 million vs. USD 30 million spent on production), would have been pleased with this approach. It, too, was a lively and interesting. The heroes in this musical are not like ones in the movie, and this is its distinctive zest. Playing on Broadway for one and a half years, this musical is not exhausted, and even got a spin-off in a tour to other cities in August of 2011. And still on play, so many years after!, From film, this musical differs, above all, with bright and sincere staging. It concludes a lot of family values and vivid jokes, from which the public laughed now and then. Rare minute passes without having to bring a fair amount of humor. What to say of Grandma joke that when she was at Woodstock of 1969 and saw John Lennon, who turned to her and said that he had no inspiration, nor any muse comes to him. And she answered him: âYou donât need it all, all you need is loveâ. The reaction of the hall had to be seen! It was very emotional joke and went very well. As many others of them. And with such jokes the performance is full. We see that those who have done this show like The Addams Family with all their heart and tried to show not the sullen mood, which abounds in the film or computer games, but something close to each family across the globe â spiritual warmth., , The plot is pretty simple, but it incorporates a carousel of gags and unusual behavior of non-standard characters that fill every second and minute of stage time. Wednesday, the daughter of the family, is in love with a boy from a simple average family, Lucas, and want to marry him. But the two families yet resist it, because they are from very different worlds. They are fundamentally other from each other literally in everything, beginning from food and style of clothing, and ending with the ability to communicate with the world of the dead., , In this staging, all imbued with the love that has different forms: from the love of tortures (as brother Pugsley), to the love of anima, that is, the Nature and its manifestations â the Moon, for example (the love of Uncle Fester to this astro object). From the word âanimaâ, by the way, the concept of animagician or animag takes its sources (from Harry Potter) â ability to turn or to cause a turn into a creature of Nature (""anima""). And this is a basis of word ""animal"" â the one belonging to Nature., , The key character, no doubt, is Gomez by Douglas Sills. He is both a strong leader and tries to follow the wishes and feelings of his family, which should be brought together every day, so they would continue remaining so., , Someone also may dislike the clothes of Morticia with very low-cut in front. Some detracts from the quietly monitoring of plot developments, despite the recognition that the dress is sitting on her body brilliantly, as if glued with the help of something sticky or adhesive. Although, in our opinion, such a variant of clothes just reflects the best the spirit of the character â as her clothes were fit in the film and cartoons. So she could hardly move. The same as here., , The overall impression of this musical â it was very heart-opened, nice, sincere and funny."
"7","Adding Machine ","    The musical is about how some elderly man, without ambitious, found his resting place on work during 25 years in one place (O great Krishna! How sad and disgusting â stay in one stuffy place for a quarter of a century!) He kills his boss, because he dared to remove him (read â fire) and replace with the counting machine (calculator or cash register). If the play would have been played 25 years ago from this very moment, the man who works with a calculator could be the same fired for the computer with Excel invented, which handles all the figures, displays the formula and makes a lot of useful reporting., , The story of the emptiness of inner little world of a lonely man who has nothing but interesting work (for him â yes, but infinitely boring for others), his wife, with which he is at henpecked position and whom he cannot stand and the mystery of love, in the face of a girl from another department of his company. This story is about a very uninteresting man, which was able to be played in more or less interesting form (because it cannot be that this musical would last for 4 years being uninteresting. And who says the opposite is a highbrow fool, who have never did any single musical). This story about the everyday life and hopelessness. On crime and punishment that follows a flagrant violation of the norms of morality. And what can be, in terms of negative consequences, if you went too far and too quickly left your habitual area, as they say now, ""comfort zone"". In general, the ""comfort zone"" is the rightful concept and the philosophical thing to determine that you need to go beyond your little comfortable world in order to achieve success. But lately it used anywhere and it has become too popular concept. So this is not a concept anymore stating the compelled explosive activity due to the unusual working or living conditions in order to survive in unfamiliar environment and to intensify your brain activity at maximum. Now it has become a mockery of itself â when you use toothpaste in the morning with the taste of pine needles instead of the usual, with the taste of the sea breeze, telling people that you have radically changed your style of behavior now., , The moral of the play is not understood â because the main character, which is not only that the murderer and apostate, but also combines such unflattering human qualities, as compromise fullness, conformity, lack of desire, reluctance to change â is allowed after death to use one more chance to live a life on the Earth. But this chance should be given for something substantial, isnât it? For example, for special merit or achievement, useful at least for some group of people or to the environment. And what did our anti-hero, except of a secret love in addition to murderous 25 years of his life before he committed an act of physical deprivation of life of the poor boss who sought to optimize his responsibility site? Nothing. Because the pursuit of excellence is unusual for such people. If his name was not familiar to his boss after a quarter century of work, perhaps this man was too pathetic to deserve even that. He stayed true Mr. Zero â because it is so true."
"8","Adrift In Macao ","    This statement is on the one act (without intermission), which in a slow and relaxed form tells of one evening in the life of a musical opium club, located in Macao (now is called Macau) â a province of China. During the performance, we are told how a lady with a very curvaceous forms â and it is often emphasized everywhere, starting from critical reviews, ending with the play itself â comes to the city and gets a job the same evening. The work is â to be irresistible and feminine at the same club, the owner of which it struck on the spot by their irresistible forms in tight clothes. Once again proving that it is important to come to an interview in spectacular costumes â you never know what position you will be offered., , ""Ticky Ticky Tocky"" and ""Mister McGuffin"" are outstanding songs written by a very talented young man, the new genius of Broadway, Peter Melnick. He was able to combine sounds of surroundings of 1940 â 1960's, nostalgic, but not too much, notes, creating a very pleasant mix that we blessed for all 90 minutes of play., We meet caricatured characters along the way â Chinese Tempura (âshrimpâ in Chinese, Malay, Thai and Indonesian languages), and opium woman who represents all descended addicts (at least those who have not yet fallen to the very bottom of utter hell of China, which you can find in the poor menâs stash). The other characters are very colorful personalities â Corinna, Lureena (women with similar names), Rick (people of 2010 â 2016 firmly associate this name with main character of mega-popular The Walking Dead serial movie from AMC, Rick Grimes)., , What binds all these motley people together? Like the heroes of Casablanca, who were waiting for their visas, locals also waiting for something. But they do not know what it is exactly. They just stay in this space here and now. And the walls in this musical made in order to emphasize not an enclose space from which the heroes do not wish to go out. No, the characters are free to leave any moment, but just donât do this. And why â no one can reliably explain. Does it matter? Maybe they like to play the comic situations and generate a variety of jokes out of thin air. Or maybe they simply have nowhere to go this evening and the club is the only place tonight, where the doors are opened and where they hearts want to be?, , Someone even compares this play with films by Alfred Hitchcock. Someone said that this musical can be visited with their children to provide them a great evening together with their parents and sparkling humor. And someone says that the story is not as important as the entourage, which created by the entire staging â sweet, gentle, charming and musical. And, above all, funny."
"9","Adventures of Tom Sawyer","    We are lament of so impressively rapid completion of this Broadway show â it had to run a total of 13 plays for 2 months in 2001 only. Since then, without being restarted. This suggests that its creators did not see there any spark. Maybe, as well as the audience. Because only children had sparkles of mischief from this play in their eyes after viewing, but not adults. They grew out of such irrepressible energy and spouted childhood, when you want something to do, to run somewhere and go in some pleasant and not quite pleasant situations. Now, after they become solid, such a lovely plays with a rather mundane problems like when Huck cannot read or what they saw in the cemetery as someone kills someone. The first problem is solved by giving son or daughter to school. And the second â by calling the police. But customs vary at all times, and there is nothing we can do about it. And if you do some entertainment programs for children, many people now prefer to put children in front of the TV, so they watched cartoons or any special children's shows, free or by cable TV. Do not need to go anywhere and to tolerate children's performance for several hours. At least, so we think that such considerations were dominant in the minds of parents who simply stopped going to this show, which influenced its closure. Otherwise, what other reasons for this?, , The show was brilliant throughout â in authentic costumes; alive and thoroughly taken scenery, which changes from scene to scene, from act to act; hot passionarity of main actors who portrayed Tom and Huckleberry. Music turned out very charming â I Can Read by the actor who portrayed Huckleberry was so good!, , What the show did not have â a couple of things. The greater depth of the main character â a girl Becky, whom Tom loved, we should expect. The viewer simply couldnât understand clearly why, in addition to her external charm, Tom has become so attracted to her. And there had to be more boyish friendship between the main heroes â they perform only one song together, and only at the end. This, according to critics, was one of the greatest blunders. Adding here a couple of songs together at the beginning â it would be just great!, All the actors played their roles, recognized by the audience as perfectly coped. With the exception of one â the role of Tom. He did not give his charm, which is inherent to the bookâs hero. There is even an opinion that the cast of Tom and Huck had to be reversed and then the show would have been much brighter. Although there are no claims to the technical performance of Tomâ part. He would better possess more professionalism for the best., , Conclusion â it is a great show, with a few flaws, perfect for the evening with the kids. But closed because of unpopularity. You can go with your children to Disneyland â it surely will be not closed within the nearest 100 years."
"10","Aida ","    Once you recognize that in the staging of this musical, Disney company was engaged, it becomes clear why does it have that versatility and high interestingness, coupled with the professionalism that splashes out at the audience from the stage, with the participation of Elton John and Tim Rice. The first does not need any advertising representations. The second was directly involved in the creation of one of the most long-running musicals in the history of Broadway shows â The Lion King. That is still shown after many thousands of plays., , This musical, despite the significant backlog in the number of plays (1852), is included in the top-100 Broadway shows, which brought their creators and participants good profit and fame in the world of musicals. Only think of how diverse and versatile Disney company is, which goes literally in every corner of our lives, where the smell of entertainment is felt! They make movies, cartoons, soap operas, TV series, musicals, shows, they have a constant Disneyland, they bought the corporations Lucasfilms and Pixar, to make the most grossing films and exciting special effects in everything they do! Just like Google in the field of IT, they are the same in the field of entertainment. Comprehensive folks., October 2000 was a month of the opening of this show, and at first, there was not a very wide scope on stage in terms of scenery â just a background that dims and brightens. Then, during the course of play, there were reconstruction of pyramids, elegant furnishings of palatial estates and deserts. Elton John recorded an album for the opening used in this musical, with a lot of celebrities, including Spice Girls, Shania Twain, Tina Turner, Lenny Kravitz and Sting. Then a joke was such this â didnât they have enough space for the mega-popular then Backstreet Boys?, , Aida was inspired by the idea and a lot of that was included, from the opera of 1871, created by Giuseppe Verdi â probably the only his famous work, which is known to every second person in the world, among the civilized countries, who know the term ""opera"" or ""musical""., Rather than start from the dark and powerful majestic charm of the opera, Elton and Tim have done homy and understood play, which tells us about one of the most famous love stories that last even through the centuries and through many incarnations (we will not argue, but we think that The Mummy movies have used the same idea, taken from the same place, the opera)., , The musical almost doesnât use verbal transitions between songs, so it is one of the most musical musicals where you will not hear a lengthy verbal constructions. You will almost certainly hear only the singing. If you would record this musical, and then played it at random point, with 99% certainty you would say that they would sing there., Fans of all good â staging, costumes, acting and clear voices of actors â certainly would have liked this musical, because it is definitely qualitative from all sides. Although someone's dislike it because of a particular person who did this work, we should recognize the exceptional strength of the resulting final product and another reincarnation of excellent work about Aida into this bright thing, right from the boring opera."
"11","Ain't Misbehavin' ","    At first, when you come to this musical, it seems that it should be pretty boring, irksome and generally evening should become excessively languid. Because it is not a classical musical, in which there is talk liner to the songs, plot development, and other typical things for Broadway works. Such as well-designed characters, original filing, lack of attacks on human weaknesses, focus on the tolerant presentation of the material. But this is only from beginning, because then starts the development of a great show, which indicates that it is not necessary to have any of the above-mentioned details, so you can just enjoy the evening. Yes, it is not a musical, but simply a get-together of variety of songs that are quite expressively served from the stage. Let it be just a lot of different people singing a lot of different songs that were written by Fats Waller and processed by Luther Henderson., Presentation that unfolding on a stage, plunges us into the atmosphere of 1920 â 1940's, filled with jazz, soaked with beauty and style, cultural development of the Renaissance in all that relates to labor and the hard life of migrant workers in the United States. âAinât Misbehavinââ â the so-called composition, which opens this play and gave its name to all event, consisting of 5 actors who sing alternately, giving the playful energy in the room with their bodies, facial expressions and movements, from which every viewer laughs now and then and feels inflamed with the play for more and more., , All play, as we have already mentioned, does not contain a storyline, nor any single character. But everything is based on how every person live during his or her stage time, what is doing on the stage, how (s)he dances and how submits own energy into the room, and what little gags (s)he released during singing., , If you like classic shows with the exact story formed, which revolves around the colorful characters and great costumes, and which elaborate light and exquisite depth and even more so, is a thriller or detective, which you can find in modern productions coming on Broadway right now, so you should miss the sight of this musical. It will entertain only with facial expressions, movements, laughter of actors and how they rave around the singing on stage. Do not expect that you will be enchanted so mush to sit on the edge of the chair, waiting for some intense interchanges. Think of this play as if the musicians on stage, that sing in the bar where you come in the evening to eat a pizza and drink a glass of chilly drink. Those will be delighted who love enough flat plays. Can we assume that this musical has added much to human development? Certainly not. Will fans of Phats Waller be pleased? Of course, absolutely."
"12","Aladdin ","    One of the playing musicals this year, which has a huge success with the public and its ads hung on each column in the New York city. Organizers are making great efforts to ensure that everyone got their ticket since demand clearly exceeds the available supply. Some critics think that the play does not expect a big success and it will not repeat the success of The Lion King, to which many like to refer today, as the most spectacular and the most successful staging by Disney. Let's leave already King alone and consider this histrionics., , In this production, there are many advantages, such as special effects, which Broadway requires in its productions. For example, such as a flying magic carpet, or suits, of which there are many and they are just brilliant. But on the other hand, the audience may seem a little bored of these items, because there are significant drawbacks., For example, all the scenery on stage, as well as trees and other environment, cut from cardboard and behave on stage as cardboards â moving and threatens about to crash when somebody runs next to them, as Aladdin, the hero., , There was not enough development of relations between Jasmine and Aladdin, which would show that special ""chemistry"", which is expected as usual between such favorable characters. For example, stage time of Jasmine was unforgivable not enough, and so we have not seen the disclosure of her character, and she looks cute and not as open-hearted and charming, as in the original cartoon., , Also play may seem strange-racist because the genie on Broadway is acted by black actor that has words like ""I am free at last!"", saying humbly addressed to Aladdin after release from the lamp. Many viewers looked at each other at this point of time, and they obviously did not like this. Despite the fact that if the director knew about this issue, could on the contrary, want to show the symbolism of the liberation of black slaves from their slavery. In life, everything turned out exactly the opposite, to the viewer. Especially to ones of Afro American origin., , No any claims to Aladdin â charming actor who is very beautiful and sings inspired and looks no less shrilly. Musical performance generally looks chic and in style of Disney, written, performed and adapted just fine. Reviews of the musical at a time when it wasnât yet put to Broadway, were not predicting it big and loud glory. Maybe because once again we see the truth of life â surveys of critics in the majority of cases have nothing to do with reality, no matter how many abstruse words they use to pose their stunted thoughts. This musical lives and feels great, with high-profile play in various world capitals on all continents of the Erath, reaching even to Australia. The most important thing is not minor flaws, which will eventually be polished, but the high spirits of tale that offered to us with this amazing heart-opened staging."
"13","Alas! Alack! Zorro's Back! ","    Someone condemns this production because of its incompetence, completely flat jokes and even inappropriate use of the meanings of words (count â illiteracy). Someone does not believe in the play, saying that humor is like meatballs (whatever that means), and all that is shown on the stage is a solid spoof and loose. Maybe it is â because the actors are just starting to walk a trail of acting and came from school. On the posters, we were met by a postscript that it is school productions. At the entrance, we have not met a cashier, as the entrance to the show was free. We think that the discontent of some individuals with a bad game â it's like spitting on moldy cheese in a mousetrap. That is, either you pass by this free treats, or you take it at your own risk. It would be like to meet Santa at the mall, to receive from him a free chocolate, and then be dissatisfied that it has no filling., , Quest Theatre Ensemble is a host of this show, though not very spectacular, but the actors are trying and this is quite noticeable, plus evening pastime is provided to you for free. If you go out on a date â this is the format on hand., , Make-up of actors was very exaggerated, but it clearly shows who is who. Animation on the scene is abound â even cacti move. It is both a romance and a potpourri and a medley of well-known songs (Hotel Cucaracha â undoubtedly the Mexican version of Hotel California)., , Rather, such a genre as selected here, is a parody of a boring idea that someone may not like it because of the very frivolous interpretations of the plot or the possibility of absorption of free popcorn and when especially good moment comes â throw it into the main villain. Everything must be treated easily and this musical represents this holy simplicity., , Actors afford speaking directly to the audience sitting in the hall. Some people donât like not very solid contrast between the female villain and a positive Anita Sweepup. But it is quite a matter of taste., , The hall is filled with live music and it is a very good move of director, whom we praise you for the invitation of band named The Four Sombreros â they have added much of entourage., , Easy mood, good evening (especially in winter slush and cold), good company and a sense of the worldâs diversity is provided to you after viewing this musical."
"14","All Shook Up ","    Another Broadway thing straight from the conveyor belt. No need to be a fan to watch this performance. It is easy and aggressive-in-a-positive-way sound of songs inspired by work of the great Elvis. The most deserving and recognizable hits in amount of about 40 pieces sounds almost endlessly. Compared with ""Good Vibrations"", it looks more alive. Unite style pleases. Characters can be called as personalities. , , On the other hand, the brightness is what makes the musical completely empty. Loud and energetic songs sound like the basis for a simple scenario. Perhaps, at those times, the play could be made more modest and decent, but now an abundance of bright decorations looks silly. , , All that has been done for the sake of the people. Based on the plot of the story by Joe DiPietro, this is what meets the trend of the national taste. , , It is obvious that the idea of the musical is similar to the idea of ""Mamma Mia"" with the songs of ABBA. Style is different, but that does not change direction. , , Songs have lost their individuality. All of them sound like one. In addition, it is a challenge that once made Elvis so dangerous in the eyes of the parents of teenagers that had been removed completely. , If some fans expect a bright parody on Elvis, let's face it â you wonât see an effective parody. This is the story of a smooth lad bad guy in a leather jacket with a guitar that looks more like a film for family viewing., , The essence of the story is that the young rebel Chad comes to town, where everyone is afraid of strict law. Thanks to Chad, the entire city begins to swirl around the forbidden fruit of love without borders. , The musical uses the old technique. The most familiar songs are repeated. Similarly, as in ""Good Vibrations"" and ""Mamma Mia"". It is so old that no longer touches., , The rich decorations are noteworthy. Especially the ""Jailhouse Rock"", where the scene is very detailed. , The whole picture looks like a tribute to Elvis and his style. In another case, there is always Las Vegas, which is also full of copies of Elvis. , , Like everything that is going on in this genre, everything is repeating. Yes, it is expensive, high-qualified, but â repetition. However, it cannot leave your heartstrings intact at all."
"15","Allegro ","    Stephen Sondheim â the director of this musical â did everything in his powers to talk about inner feelings of the protagonist through the prism of the format of the genre. Joseph Taylor, Junior â the son of a small businessman that was born in 1905 and experienced his best form, the heyday of physical health, during all-over-the-country crisis of the Great Depression that broke many souls and destinies., , At first, we watch long (maybe too long) on quite normal, ordinary person, growing up, going to school, to college, meeting a local girl, communication with which will be felt throughout the play (and many years of life that prospectively and retrospectively shown us from the stage), only to effectively display absence of happy ending., , The most important thing in the play â the mapping of constant uncertainties of the protagonist (and some supporting characters), in relation with the changing outside world, which is full of both heavy choices and temptations offered to you if you are quite ambitious person, loving your job and are ready to give yourself fullest with all heart to it., , Despite the availability of opportunities to display in this piece of everything that surrounds our heroes, and to give more time to each to reflect all of the tragedy that happened to them, the director Stephen Sondheim decided to concentrate fully on what is happening in the world of the main hero. So we see anguish over the fact that seems like his girlfriend (who left in a small town) begins dating the other (of course she would â because he is far away!). Temptations in the form of the active friend, who takes him on every party where he meets a beautiful lady. Cycle of a financial collapse that has gripped the country and the background of this â when he is offered excellent and promising work, with an increase in salary and the guarantee of a comfortable existence. All this is woven together and poured in portions along with the songs of Joe, who takes his not very interesting statement the bigger part of time. The play almost does not develop. If in his place was a really active person â all these mental anguishes would have resulted in 1 or 2 minutes, after which he, gritting his teeth, reluctantly but inevitably would go further to meet the new opportunities that are available in a crisis the most. Actually, the crisis for people with an internal self-motivation is the possibilities that are opened for you at this time, when it is good to reconsider your approach and look on life, to dive into the maelstrom of the new attracting world, which itself changes along., , Off-town plays of this musical were truly disastrous. Broadway audience also reacted with caution to the play, often not even buying-off all the tickets to it. What is this called if not a commercial failure?"
"16","Altar Boyz ","    These five boys look something like a pathetic parody of the Backstreet Boys, and present a whole impression as of Jewish boy's band. One is Latino, the second is Hebrew, third is Europeans, the fourth is Asian, and fifth is the average American. Motley crew, really. Over time, the composition of musical has changed, but invariably they remained five. After the regular changes, all this national diversity has completely disappeared and they began to be averaged, beautiful, very nice and everyone, without exception, had American look, of Caucasian ethnicity., , The essence of the musical in playing on the difference of people, to convey to the audience the idea that we are all not same and it is good. They do not shine with elegant voices, but the production of this style may not differ with impeccable sound. Singers clearly praise Jesus (âJesus called me on my cellphoneâ â well, can this happen in normal life, not in a drugged-up delirium?). Singing in churches when there is a selected chorus to make some rock gospel would sound better than this., , All songs of this are attempt to convey to people that Jesus loves all and the Church receives all. Forgetting about the horrors of the Inquisition in Europe of 12 â 17 centuries, during the so-called ""dark ages"", where more than half of the millennium (only think about!) the Church forbade human development; therefore, all were in terrible ignorance, poverty and endless deaths from lack of medicine. The Inquisition would burn these performers in the fires, if they dare to sing same at those times, as preachers of Satan. And now it is considered OK â this song is aimed at popularization of the Catholic Church â the most cruel ruler of all time and the largest landowner in the world (really, you can check yourself). They still have enough wealth. Well, okay â let everyone decide for himself â whether to serve this infinitely merciful Lord or to find the joy of being with some other, more humane religion â Buddhism, for example., , They read rap, singing gospel, pop and several other genres. Sometimes they give some jokes based on their appearance or movements. Clearly understandable jokes to the general public and everyone laugh., , A wide variety of musical instruments that are used in the play, as well as all that aura of carelessness, which is inherent to this spectacle, puts us with a difficult choice to decide â whether this play is for young people (in the same approximate age as these young people, the main actors) or is it for the children, whose minds are not yet formed., , NY Musical Theater Festival opened this production in 2004. The salt here is made mainly on the exceptional voice data, but not on various material. There are almost no words said, only singing., , Singers with the biblical names easily rave on stage, do skits and funny gags. Director is Stafford Arima. K. D. Aguila wrote a book and music taken from different authors. Christopher Gattelli responsible for the choreography."
"17","American Idiot ","    This show played on Broadway for more than a year (over 420 performances), and went on a tour to Britain. Based on the very popular rock opera, explains in an accessible, interesting and lively form the consequences of being festive and laziness, if you are â passive personality, which has no spiritual wealth., , Three blockheads who are stuck in a small town, go against the system, and the system in turn, do not stand on ceremony with them â break them to serious tests, such as drugs, promiscuity gender relations and even war injuries for those who considers war to be a nice place., , Alex Nee name of the actor who played Johnny â the chief of the trio of anti-heroes, who, despite the fact that are friends, according to the plot, separate for a year, during which befall to ideological metamorphosis, did not enrich them nor change the direction and didnât make them to be positive heroes. They remain the same strange and repulsive young people, but now each of them lived some experience and will remember its teaching for a long time, if not to the end of life (and someone has to live till the end of life with physical injury)., , An interesting scene where large nurse flies over staying in the world of hallucinations Tunny, who is in the hospital after the operation after extracting the bullet and cut-off his limb â this is akin to the hallucinations experienced by second hero â Will â alcohol and the third â Johnny â from drugs. Maybe this story thing combines characters somehow with immaterial esoteric communication and it is this fact â such hallucinations â leads to their meet in one year?, , Someone may think that this play is not tolerant of the girls, because they almost do not have their names â only the templates that are accepted by society as a common definition of quality of girls â among men â Whatshername and Extraordinary Girl., , In general, it turned a clever piece that you cannot watch with the whole family, not to impart the wrong postulates of behavior and even thoughts to your younger children, but you, as being the adult audience, will certainly be interested in this, for the overall development."
"18","American in Paris","    Without unnecessary intricacies, a musical based on the 1951 film of the same name, tells the story of a certain segment of lives of four main characters â three men and one woman who are somehow connected with the Bohemia (somebody sings, another plays and a third draws). All this is happening on the background of the first years after WWII, and the plot involves a love triangle, one side of which is not passion or love, but simple affection, mixed-up with a very great sense of responsibility., , Paris devoted many admiring odes. Moreover, Paris became the center of European culture in the eyes of Americans. For example, when someone from USA says that he is going to Europe, all around admire ""Oh, Paris, a romantic place you choose!"". As if there no other places in Europe â London, Vienna, Prague, Warsaw, Krakow, Lvov, Kiev, Dublin, Amsterdam, Manchester, eventually! And very different opinions of public on both ends of the ocean exist. For example, someone from Berlin tells his friends that the local girls are too constrained and he is going to go for a week to USA, to find horny girls there. And the same, in USA someone tells his friends that the local girls are too constrained and he is going to go for a week in Europe, to find horny girls there. And in both situations, their friends completely agree these guys! It is so amusingly!, , On the same principle of ignorance of the real situation, this film was conceived and implemented. But whatever the reason is, the result was more than excellent. The film won the Oscar, and musical on Broadway received a Tony Award. And there, and there music and singing are the main things, not what is happening at the background of plot (because it all can be told literally within three sentences). It has a backdrop of confronted worlds â sullen world of post-war Europe and all attempts of characters to stay positive and to think about much better world than the one that you see looking out the window., , Broadway musical involves 25 actors, which are led by an experienced team of people, one of whom received the Pulitzer, the other received a Tony, and the rest â just experienced fellows, on account of which more than one fantastically successful staging., , The musical was played in Paris and in the USA and we would not be surprised if after its great success, it will go on a tour to capitals of the world, rolling up even to the Philippines, how often other musicals from Broadway do."
"19","American Mall ","    The film was created by the same company that made almost the same musical, and also about a supermarket â HSM. The parallels between these two are very obvious to accent attention on them. Very distant from life, this film is intended for an audience of young children who have not yet entered the stage of teenagers, which usually covers the audience of 14 to 21, and is designed for the hearts of those who are between 8 and 14. Because these are young people, who do not know that supermarket, school and friends â are not everything in life., , In general, the topic of supermarkets as close as possible to the Americans who invented such a thing as a ""supermarket"" (they may yet have different names: shopping malls, hypermarkets, shopping centers, megastores etc.). Whatever the name, they perform several key functions: they are cozy, domestic, you can eat and drink there, buy almost anything, from clothes to the music center and from sweets to a car. You can meet with your friends there, you can spend your time, feeling very protected, in contrast to the world around its walls â unpredictable, evil and directed against you., , Despite the abundance of musical scenes, which are represented by smiling people and the unbridled joy, the film consists of too much clichÃ©s to consider it in any way believable or carrying real artistic value. Spoiled Princess, whose family is not full and who has no real friends, only remoras, depicting her friends. The guy-next-door who is the real leader of the team, runs ahead of the car, and moonlighting as a janitor, in spite of the perfect tan, gorgeous body and impermissible fancy body of surfer with a face of the model. The girl-next-door, the image of which was unbelievably managed by Emmanuelle Chriqui (in particular, in the movie named â100 Girlsâ), are taken up and actively exploited by Nina Dobrev (although, of course, a descendant of Ukrainian immigrants, Larisa Oleynik, in the same film is the best girl-next-door â the dream of many men for infinitely cute image shown by her)., , There are many bright colors in the film, beautiful people (and it seems that they may be smart, nice and say some important things exactly until the moment when they open their mouths), coordinated wanton dances, when 2-4 main actor begin to dance and in seconds it appears that all around are dancing. If that film had focus on real life, on better quality of songs, choreography and general saturation of the plot, then it would turn out not bad. If the main girl character has been chosen relatively serious, then the main actor is a muscular parody on the actor named Jerry O'Connell."
"20","Andrew Lloyd Webber Divas ","    Memory is a song that was sung by many and now performed by Betty Buckley from this musical sounds collection, with great feeling (we originally heard it in an infinitely peerless musical Cats). It is right when it sang by operatic voice, which is present here in full, completed with ""live"" sound that is often lacking to classic opera singers. Her version has everything â living-through the emotions which it represents; communicating with the public; sadness, joy and despair; and excellent possession of the voice. This performance, along with Don't Cry For Me, Argentina (by Madonna) and As If We Never Said Goodbye (by Barbra Streisand, from Sunset Boulevard) â highlights of this collection. Of course, every song from the collection deserves a lot of respect, and each has been fundamental to the future of work in the field. For example, a film starring Madonna talks about the difficult, but loud fate of women Evita â a fighter for the rights of the same-name country (Argentina)., , A rare combination of external angelic beauty and very elegant body of Katherine Jenkins and her monumental voice of opera singer â is indeed rarity to hear (and see). Andrew Lloyd Webber generally likes the strong (and beautiful) women and often gives them in his works â films, musicals â strong parties to voices and in plot, with which, we must admit, they cope surprisingly well. Perhaps as a tribute to the maestro, who are not only believes, but also loves and appreciates them as actors and people. And, most likely, this is why Andrew has so much successful works, constituting the golden fund of the human heritage, which must be remained to descendants., , Some women have even become famous after the execution of these songs, working with Andrew Lloyd Webber. Among them are Sarah Brightman, Patti LuPone and Elaine Paige. Betty Buckley even eclipsed with her execution of the song Memory singer Elaine Paige, who introduced us it in the musical Cats, first in the West End (before it has migrated to Broadway). Glenn Close is an actress, who is known to the general public by films about Dalmatians, gives here a song from Sunset Boulevard, Broadwayâs show (and therefore came into the compilation instead of Patti LuPone, who sang a song With One Look in London)., , Sarah Brightman took part in the musical The Phantom Of The Opera, but sings a song in the collection Surrender of Sunset Boulevard."
"21","Anna Karenina ","    Of course, this is entirely the Broadway version of creation ""Anna Karenina"" by Leo Tolstoy. The fact that such a musical was nomination with 4 Tony Awards says that in 1993 (the year on which the nominations for 1992 were determined), there was not a lot to choose from. Obviously, there was a mass of circumstances that have not allowed this production to last more than meager 46 plays. Dan Levine in 2003 recorded a CD with songs from this musical (which were sung by a completely different actors), and it seemed logical to the fact that after 15 years, the record of an album is needed. Original music played by an orchestra of only 7 people (it is not clear why such a large-scale production were played on a horribly tiny scene of Theatre named Circle In The Square), but for the record in 2003 the whole music was re-written for a large orchestra. Despite the redo, the music still does not sound clearly more ambitious than it sounded in the original orchestra pit in a small volume. Pity., , According to Kerry Butler, depicting Kitty in musical on stage, its main problem that it was too fragmented, plain, linear and deprived of unpredictability to convey reliably the spirit of Tolstoy's story. Initially, more than several hundred pages of the work were placed into something that did not even played two hours of duration. While the costumes were very colorful and dresses are three-dimensional, they did not reflect the fashion trends of that time, which portrayed on stage. The costume guy clearly did not consider it necessary to examine the geographic era and did something in style of Colonial America, but not in the style of the world of Kingdom of the Russian Empire of 18th century., , The drama is in the frame on stage, but the drama itself does not even smell, as the actors did not try to play it convincingly via words nor their songs. All played without heart. First of all, the actors themselves are not convincing. Songs of mixed styles (for example, when Vronsky sang We Were Dancing, it turned waltz, though it had to be mazurka). This version of the play is not accurate, even in the most dramatic moments, such as the death of the staff at the train station (emotions on the stage were made so untrue so people sitting in the hall were asking: ""That's it?""). Staging may appeal only to those who are passionate about all Broadway things and precise transmission of information, not stick to emotional pitches."
"22","Annie Get Your Gun ","    Both musical performances are good â the first in the 1950s and one following after nearly half a century, in 1999 (revised to adapt the present vision and reinforced the basic format, making it to be the show within the show). In addition to the musical film, there were also radio plays. However, the original play in terms of costumes loses much to common sense and to what actually were people wearing in the 1800th or 1700th, particularly those living in the Wild West. If you take away from them the white garment, stripes in all places, curly decorative embroidery, and the ideal branded clothes and make it all dirtier, get rid of cleanliness with its excessive brilliance, sequins, lace and fur, and give it the status of every dayâs life â so we will receive something about equally plausible to clothing worn in the third part of the Back To The Future. Especially to one in what mercenaries in the faces of gang of bullies headed by Tannen were dressed in., , Since Ethel Merman were not starring in rethought play, who was a friend of Dorothy Fields, but Bernadette Peters replaced her, who really had serious talent, this musical has gained not only new colors from a talented performance, but also from rethinking of story and format of its filing. Slightly rustic way of giving the accent, which is tied to Annie now, does not interfere with the rest of anything â singing, comedy talent and the play itself. Despite the apparent feeling that Irving Berlin, who remade the show after half a century, was thinking of Dorothyâs play, he had to be at the forefront of those who clapped frantically to Bernadetteâs acting., , Tom Wopat, who acts the lead male role â Frankâs, deserves a lot of respect for his talent and its revelation on the stage. May it be that his voice is not strong operatic, but he has his own assured way of the parties and perfectly sings in a duet with Annie., , In the show, a lot of whom are worth mentioning for the bright achievements â a great dancer Andrew Palermo and very interesting presentation of jokes by N. R. Snelson and the demonic nature of Valerie Wright, that she passed tremendously through the prism of her character â Dolly Tate., , Sitting Bull is the remaining character, depicting an Indian â the chief who gets good money for his oil-bearing land on which the government has set the towers. Despite the fact that songs, discriminating Indians, have been deleted, the comic and insulting character remained, as an atavism of the past. Play-in-play is very nice course, but it is not used as talented as in the production The Rivals, which was featured in the Williamstown Theatre, and it is a pity that Mr. Stone, along with his chief aide â decorator T. Walton did not watch the abovementioned play to learn the successful approach., , We should also mention a decent staging of dance at the beginning of the musical, which includes many dancers (good work of G. Daniele, choreographer). However, the Broadway version of the musical was cut by about 10 minutes, initially it lasted 2:50."
"23","Annie ","    The musical is designed for family audiences, as there is very bright and with great contrast family issues displayed and developed, as well as issues of personal space, happiness, hideous life where you are not loved, and how good it is when there is somebody in this big and hostile world to whom you are not indifferent, who will make your life better and fill it with fatherly love. And whom you, in turn, give back, having invested in this man all the love that you have accumulated over many years of suffering and wailing, and that you have not expended at not even a drop, being in an orphanage., , Since 1977, the show has won 7 awards of Tony, the film adaptation of the musical has been performed and  countless times it changed actors due to the nature of the musical â the main part of the actors depicts orphaned girls. During all this time, not less than 5 times it was rolled for national tour not only on Broadway, but also in other places, cities and countries. Probably, the total number of showâs play is one of the largest in all the history of musicals. And branching on a screen only confirms this., , The plot revolves around a little girl named Annie, from the light of experiences of whom everyone is able to find for himself something to cry of and what to be happy. The same as Annie, the viewer learns to rejoice that tomorrow the sun will also shine, not to worry on some daily issues, because they are a temporary phenomenon. Through optimism, sincerity and kind mischief, Annie wins not only the hearts of her friends and the future daddy, who was really touched after a day of communicating with her, but also the hearts of the audience, which, from screens and being the audience, from stage, watch this play with a sincere empathy., , Despite the fact that the story has a lot of tested and techniques that have become clichÃ©s â the evil antagonist, good prince and endured hardships, amplifying the death of parents, whom Annie has always wanted to know but did not have chance to do it, they played with a renewed sense that so passionately pulled from chests of all the main actors. This is an example of the kindness and true American miracle that can happen under certain circumstances, if frank, strong desire exists to make this world a better place., , Disclosure of the world of the Great Depression â for the residents of an entire continent is still remains a sore point â and often, new ideas being drawn from it, along with stories and inspiration. Its background is advantageous to create a dramatic setting. Almost any topic is more advantageous in terms of drama, if it is set against the backdrop of the ruins â no matter caused by what â war, depression or an alien invasion., , Despite the full drama, the story has a lot of jokes, humor, positivity, and it all leaves a light veil of ""homy"", for which we go to these performances."
"24","Anyone Can Whistle ","    Despite the extremely illogical plot, lots of unrelated current events, as well as amazingly negative experience of performances on Broadway, the show here and there, throughout 1964 and up to 2010, in various countries, was resumed and brought back to life. However, from 1964 to 1990 it was a big break for 26 years, when it was truly forgotten. In its format, it is an attempt of satire at multiple things of our everyday life â greed, the inability to carry on business, religion, psychology, opportunism, politics and even tourism. Attempts to ridicule were clumsily woven trying to tell that raising of some ordinaries, totally unimportant things to the rank of worship is unnecessary. For example, the fact that someone does not know how to whistle, and should worry about it. Why does someone need to be oppressed by this circumstance in real life, if this inability doesnât add nor take your points in the race for survival? There are some attempts to be funny, to become even a cult thing (and some call it like that). But, excuse me, how can something be a cult, if it is terribly unpopular? Cult thing is something that is the object of worship of the masses. And if no one knows of musical except the theater worms who consistently try to re-start the show, but they never get more than a couple dozen of shows. Then why try so stubbornly to fail again and again?, , In music, there is a mixture of the same, like vinaigrette in plot. At closer look, some critics are obvious that the action really happens in a psychiatric hospital, where absolutely all without exception are psychos. And viewers are either accomplices or bystanders, as on the other side of the glass. But this is one side of the though. There are other interpretations. For example, they think as theater directors simply periodically subtly mock the audience, performing a musical in which everything is good, in general, from the costumes to the lighting, except of the story â it does not exist, and the actors just mock on the stage with a pretty good music., , Critics, however, note the high interest that gives the show and excellent play of actors and it all deserves permanent resurrections. They note that this show isnât promise the commercial success, but the outstanding elements, which is inherent to all that is happening on stage, cover all the negative aspects. Of course, the public knows better â they simply ignore this musical and it seems as if hall entirely filled with alone critics, which then write admiring odes to this strange product., , Behind the admiration and rather pompous words, advertising of the show is hidden, we believe (stream of activity that is raised before the next show is planned) â and nothing farer words happen â there is not a single really delighted response from the audience. Why? Because the world is already similar to a mental hospital and going somewhere to look at is the same, but in the square â only for true theater masochists."
"25","Anything Goes ","    Golden Gate Theatre on Broadway took staging of this musical, where quite soft and lively choreography was set by Kathleen Marshall. Thanks to her work, we see on stage very often, the prevailing part of the time, multiple different dances over one or several people. Groups were dancing almost always in large constitution. Perhaps her addiction to the choreography of a considerable number of people is her element, so she becomes quite easy and natural in work with large gathering of people â which is normally far more complex and ornate task than to make choreography of a modest amount of dancing actors. Probably because tap dance looks very nice from the stage (much later, Michael Flatley will prove it, who had even a nickname â The Lord of the Dance â because of his eponymous show lasting for years), the musical amongst earned awards of Tony possesses one for choreography. When awarding, a tap dance was mentioned as the main element, tipped the decision in the direction of this musical., , Of course, many of the actors and their roles deserve attention â for example, a former priest Reno Sweeney, who devoted his life to lead a burlesque promoterâs existence with his ward girls â angels (which, of course, behave as dominant demonesses). Maybe even all predecessors, who portrayed its role, were not so damn convincing in its versatility even up to 1934, when this role was first depicted by Ethel Merman. Hence, the songs in her performance because of the adorable husky voice and image, mixed with so many contradictions, are truly vivid., , T. Crouse & J. Weidman rewrote the book of 1934, adapted it for the production of 1987 and a few years later, it was again modified to be adapted. Initially, the book was written by H. Lindsay & R. Crouse â it is remarkable that the latter was the father of the abovementioned T. Crouse, who continued to work on the same musical. This dynasty is remarkable. And even the original book is a revision of W. G. Bolton, which was originally the libretto, written under the influence of emotions of the wreck of the ship, the cruise liner, on the coast of New Jersey., , This rich history of musical taken from life, serves as the perfect backdrop for an acting of Erich Bergen (at least if we look at the last staging, of 1987), who plays a character named Billy Crocker â amorous and romantic man who is in love by fate. And forced to depict half-spy costumed game during the whole play. Surrounding of the main character is of so many different people representing the most vivid vices of humanity. Still, removed of all the censure and filled with bright staging, which should certainly get a response in the souls of many viewers, the director has made an excellent play, which is sure to get more than one future resurrection."
"26","Applause ","    We are not in doubt that according to the same principle film of Farelli brothers Thereâs Something About Mary with Cameron Diaz in the lead role has been named. Everyone went crazy with the beautiful and smiley girl so much that around her a vortex of events formed â just as in this play. Margo was eventually put on the first place â a long-standing and well-known actress who, as in the movie named Showgirls by Paul Verhoeven of 1995, starring Elizabeth Berkley (the film failed to gain profitable revenues against its expenditures). Showgirls in bright, expressive and very seductive manner tells about a girl who has achieved tops of fame after replaced in the most brazen manner much more vivid and experienced actress who was on top of the world in a dance show on Las Vegas. This musical contains, in fact, the same storyline â we have someone experienced and grown wise and she weakens the vital grip letting the newcomer slipped through into her life (in astronomical terms â it is just the blink) and so the latter captures all the world of the person, forcing her out and firmly pushing her off the pedestal of greatness to which she has elevated herself., , The plot is quite interesting and eternal as the world â old and experienced person is going through the onslaught of the young, who eventually takes her place of life, work and achieves this much more quickly than was obtained by an experienced one. This is generally called the circle of life and the wheel of incessant roundabout where you have to step aside someday to make way for progress in the face of new people or new technologies (new technologies are the basis for changes to a small gray man in the musical named Adding Machine, who has been fired from his job due to the technological progress). It happens everywhere, and this cannot be avoided. Stability only is on the cemetery and this is the harsh truth of life youâd better getting used to. Precisely this global idea is embodied in this play, which is done against the backdrop of the theater and antagonists are the old and the young actresses. Last gradually enters the circle of life of Margo and eventually fully incorporates all her surroundings., , The story began to be developed in the distant 1946 as radio show. Then the next stage was the film adaptation and, starting from it, there was built completely independent musical that came out even more vibrant and colorful than the movie itself. Critics praised film, and it had a huge box office success â surely, as it told about what is close to everyone. The film was phenomenally successful in terms of awards â there were 14 Oscar nominations and 6 wins received out of them. The movie was filmed in 1950, and a musical â 20 years later. Musical lasted for 896 performances, which at that time was truly stunning number. Now, nobody will be surprised of even the figure of 3000 ones, which at least five musicals have crossed. In London, the show took another 382 plays, since November of 1972."
"27","Apple Tree","    Stuart Ostrow invented not to put a musical in a long story, but in a few short stories, each of them should complement the general line of the plot. On the other hand, after watching the musical, there is a feeling that it is just three stories that are linked only by the fact that they are philosophic. After all, there is no common line between them that is clearly visible â the actors are different all the times and stories are different too. Even morality from every part of the play is also different, own. It is visible, that there were attempts to unite these, but the audience had the opportunity to convey right only moral, but not to link all the parts together. Is it bad? Not at all. Each part was pretty intense and not longer than necessary. And if they were not united under one ""roof"", they might not get a short and distinct performances that would be simply interesting., , What's good in that we have seen three different productions? First, the savings on the ticket â for one price you get not one, but three stories, each of which is colorful and juicy by itself., , In the first one, there is a free retelling of the biblical story of Adam and Eveâs acquaintance, their exile, the birth of two sons, killing of one son by another and the death of Eve â a love story that does not leave indifferent. Told with feeling, properly and wisely, where all religious is removed and only universal is left. This option really made this play universal., , The second part leaves us suffering from a big mystery and everyone decides for himself, what is the end of this part. Especially the physicists will like it that are familiar with the concept of the mind experiment of SchrÃ¶dinger's cat. That explains the two concepts at once: physical â about the state of duality of elementary particles in quantum physics and philosophical â about the fact that the observer affects the observed. This is when there is a box in which the cat is. In the box, at an arbitrary time deadly gas goes in to so the cat dies. But we may know whether the cat is alive or already dead, only after opening the box. And in a meanwhile, until it is closed, the cat is potentially in both states at the same time â alive and dead. So, the experimenter determines the condition of the cat with the fact of the observation â is it certainly alive or certainly dead. And in the absence of the fact of observation, we contribute that cat both alive and dead simultaneously, without being able to determine the state with reliability. This is what happens in quantum physics â elementary particles simultaneously have two states, conditionally, ""0"" and ""1"", when we do not observe. So in this part of the play, this is what is behind a  door, chosen by hero at the direction of his beloved? Tiger, who would kill him, or a slave girl, whom he has to marry, cheating his beloved?, , The third part is the smallest â it reveals quite reworked story of Cinderella, which becomes a pumpkin at midnight. Details are different; the essence remains. Moral â being yourself â always the best solution. Because hiding behind the mask of another person, you may not think that all those who are around us â even closest ones â may also wear masks of other people, and we may not like ones hidden under them. Though here we have happy ending, but the 50/50 probability is always a lottery."
"28","As Thousands Cheer ","    The secret of the success of the musical became hard humor that linked the plot with provocative headlines and the names of celebrities., , With the return of the musical and there were talks about the returning of that stinging headlines, but now critics have come to the conclusion that nowadays the jokes are much angrier. Perhaps the point is not in a bad sense of humor, but rather in the influence of time. In those days, it was easier to be known as evil satirist, whereas now it can hardly surprise anyone., , The new version is much softer. It lasts for a little bit over an hour. During this time, we can see the great songs and dances, although there are fewer than in the first version., , Replacements of songs seem to be very worthy. For example, one of the original songs of the composer in its amended form blends harmoniously with the ending, reminding us of the Great Depressionâs time. This enthusiasm transforms musical into a window of awakening. Listening and remembering versions of the songs on the piano, the incomparable ""Heat"", we are transported at a time. Again the voice of the legendary ""Harlem"", Paris premiere and the very significant headlines that made the whole country to talk about., , One of the most successful examples of controversial is recognized caption associated with the legendary Gandhi. His call in the midst of a hunger strike has become a kind of motto for the whole show. Along with this, we can see the history of Hoover and his wife, leaving the White House. The image of Roosevelt is involved into these scenes., , The creators are not afraid to make fun of once taboo subjects, ironically beating and showing us the real situation. The legendary Rockefeller also is in some scenes, snatched his role as one of the main figures of that times., , The ending is amazing, as it should be. We hear a song that has not yet been sung â it turns our whole idea of the play. It is easy to travel back in time to the 30s and realize that idea is firstly is all in the money, not a massacre."
"29","Aspects of Love ","    Despite the fact that the creator of music and brilliant man by the name of Andrew Lloyd Webber has many fans of his work, this particular musical was not so much loved by them. Yes, it has been resurrected many times and seen during the on-site demonstrations more countries than the 80% of globeâs people see in their lives, but almost all of it â including re-plays â were in the United Kingdom., , The plot is fairly simple â the story through the prism of the life of the four main people for prospect of 17 years. This is about how people meet, get together and fall apart, how their children born, and how these children get in love with those whom you loved 14 years ago. It is also about how former spouses can come together and now your ex and your ex-husband's got familiar and very much attracted to each other., , Criticism was not as breaking wave on this Broadway show â they just spat it a few times and the show was decided to be closed after 399 performances â 377 plays and 22 rehearsals., , Positive sides of this play:, â¢	great voices that sing marvelously every time;, â¢	beautiful costumes and the choreography is not bad;, â¢	the plot is not too confusing and even artless to be understood to all the spectators., , Negative qualities include:, â¢	that was a plus, it can now serve as a minus â too simple, clear and obvious plot â there is almost nothing happens, except that the characters are constantly fall in love with each other;, â¢	negative perception of the audience of the fact that one of the actors â is from 12 to 16 years old at different times of the play â that is, a minor â and she is being in love with a man who is 17 years older than her. Incidentally, this is the main story line of all the second act and it has whole bunch of hints on such little inadequate and unhealthy relations. There is also experience (depending from type of the show â thin or fat) of one-gender relations between two girls., , Despite the fact that the USA is a country of open morals, Broadway is visited by mainly those who have high morals, and they definitely cannot accept that frivolity, which made the foundation of this play., , Many critics did not like the musical accompaniment â said that it is crumpled and in general, if the maestro Andrew Lloyd Webber would listen to it, he would never praised this version., , The creators could not manage accurately enough to do with the issues of relations between genders, especially in a situation of two generations that is depicted on the stage. You cannot criticize the play, because it is not bad. But it is impossible to praise also, because it is not good. Something averagely discouraging â rather, this can be said in support of the words of critics. It's about love, but love is not displayed precisely. It's about relationships, but the motivation of the main characters remained vague and not conveyed to the audience."
"30","Assassins ","    One of the killers here was pleased that took the life of someone who controls the money. As if money is the evil. Not their usage to do the immense protrusion of all human vices â pride, self-centeredness, phenomenal laziness, lust, and other sins. After all, the one who gathered under a single set these deadly 7 vices, was a clever guy â he knew that each of them corrupts person and turns him or her from being a human, into a biological animal without aspirations, ambitions and mired in stagnation due to its omission. And to never let this happen, a person must, by self-motivation, push oneself to do every-day work to make own life better. And to set the directionâs vector in the way of the maximum get-away from this vices, that were gathered under one set, as the maximum degree of human degradation, and the point from which you should stay away., , Here you will hear many big names of anti-heroes â murderers, fanatics and mentally degraded individuals. For example, Lee Harvey Oswald. There were different famous names involved as: director Sam Mendes, Jodie Foster as the picture, immensely stylish Neil Patrick Harris (who owns the well-known to the throughout progressive youth after 25 phrase ""Legenâ¦ wait for itâ¦ dary!"")., , The plot tells the story of what considerations were guided by and with what murderers of notable personalities â presidents, mayors, as well as ordinary people in large numbers â went through. You can see why they generally originated such ideas, and would they really could do anything without changing the course of history not in fanatical way as senseless assault but via bringing own views in a civilized way., , Generally, it is amusing that someone decided to make such a musical, which plunges us into the heads of anti-heroes. Usually, all Mankind is always satisfied with the tales that one of the current heroes is positive and so very unselfish, taking the path of struggle against evil. But it is dull and gray. Ones who really interesting â are anti-heroes. After all, all anti-heroes are multi-faceted, albeit infinitely dark, but still lively and interesting to the world and they are full of logically linked chains of causality that made them to become like these. And now, we are admired of, for example, Lord Darth Vader, much more than his flat, in terms of character, son, who portrayed by Mark Hamill. And, perhaps, this play revived as many times, and has received numerous awards and had admirations from audiences and critics because of that., , Each of the murderers, who was depicted here, interprets the American dream in the own way. Someone thinks that it is time to stop being slaves. Someone reflects that education is not quite well-managed. Another judges from his point of terrible working conditions and small salaries. Therefore, they want the most radical solution to the problem, not understanding that it will only lead to more confusions."
"31","Avenue Q ","    First of all, this production is for those who have grown and experienced all the ""charms"" of adulthood. Who learned that it is difficult, that they must fight with everything around you to find your way and to succeed in this constant struggle. It is about the difficulties and adversities, with which you have to face being a yesterday's college graduate. And it is tried to be displayed even through a rather complex control of puppets. After all, in addition to being a puppeteer, an actor himself often has to portray emotions in parallel, to act on the scene organically, and do not forget to properly interact with other characters. Say that this is difficult â is to say the half. Therefore, there were only very talented actors collected on the stage who were able to cope with all the simultaneous tasks., , Staging was opened in 2003 and continues to this day in various modifications â it travels around the globe, despite the closure on Broadway back in 2005. 2534 of Broadway presentations of the play were given, allowing the show to enter the top 25 of the longest plays ever. In addition, the show was re-opened there in 2009, and for all time, has won several Tony awards. In 2015, it is not expected to close the play and its creators already have quite a clear plan for at least 2016. Who knows, maybe in a few years will be the third reopening on Broadway â a fate of the show would be amusing in such case., , The show has seen a number of countries â USA, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, UK, China and Ireland., , So long staging allowed to cope better with many technical aspects of the show â control of puppets, their simultaneous managing by two people etc. But, unfortunately, for all time there was no logically explanation added â any considering sufficient â to the question, why some characters are performed by people, and some are puppets. This fact is not as alarming as it may seem, because anyway, plenty of people on the stage, and they are showing emotions, adding more depth with their movements and positions of the bodies to reveal the moment, than it can make a puppet. It is not surprising, because the puppets donât possess the arsenal of facial expressions, which is available for people., , Show is for adults or, at least, for those who consider themselves as such. Kids will definitely not be interested in, despite the presence of dolls. But those topics that they discuss and even those things that they periodically do on stage â clearly are not for children's ears nor eyes., , What was the main bet when creating this show â is the complexity of adult life, the variety of challenges, which have been put to ones who was adult for long time already and both for those who just started their path in the field of senselessness of pastime, called life. That not always all utterly monotonous life situations in the end turned to happy endings. That development of things can be variable and life is hard and eventually ends with death."
"32","Babes In Arms ","    If you are the theatergoer, who reconciled no circumstances to watch any new production, then you very likely will love to see this one. You can even gather the entire family because the plot is so watered-down that it is almost no plot. Of course, people are singing and dancing on stage, and even dressed in the fashion of that time about which the play says â the period between 1920 and 1930, in America, that is not yet at the peak of its rich blooming. Heavy pre-war years, when people's minds largely spaced with ideas of racial segregation, a slowdown in production, of the cold winters and accelerating pace of life. They did not know any of such as a powerful labor union, or couldnât call at any time from their personal phone. And having personal TV at home â this simply could not be a thing for the poor ones. Where working for 40 cents per hour was incredibly well-paid position., , In the musical, in which almost nothing happens, except of singing, it is difficult to assume the existence of the plot. It, oddly enough, is there. It tells about a group of young people, who dream to make their own musical; they have no other concerns and constantly falling in love with each other. This play is emasculated and there is no resemblance to the philosophical and ethical-filled version, which saw the world in 1939. Redone for 1959âs staging, it has only drawbacks, but all the advantages that were giving depth to the original, were lost. After all, the constant vanilla singing and clumsy kisses of all with all are doing this thing excessively boring. This musical can be visited exceptionally by the elderly cat-ladies, maidens of forty with red hairs, in a pink dresses eating cotton candies of the same shade. Just to forget what was this play about, after a couple of weeks., , We are hard to imagine is there any valuable thing that this show gives to the real life. One can only assume that such a total lack of serious backgrounds allows just look at the movements, singing and dancing, smiley faces and forget all the bad things that you have in life. But only if you originally came to the show with, at least, neutral, or above, mood. If you have hellish mood, then the senseless roundabout of smiling idiots will annoy you even more., , Behind the boring pompous words of theater critics hides unwillingness to recognize that this show is a full zero. That they would never have gone to film with the same content. What they would have never participated in any similar life situations. Why? Because it is booooring. This is only how you can describe the loss of a couple of hours of your life (including gathering and traffic jams on the both sides of the way â all 5)."
"33","Baby ","    Unsophisticated name â Baby: The Musical â allows you to think from the beginning that this play is about what is usually told in all such mundane plays: how it is difficult to raise children, how fast they grow, how they have the first word, the first step, and similar components of the carousel of life that is so inevitable, so it has already stuffed on edge to all except of lisping vanilla mothers., , However, the show about kids does not have children themselves â are only feelings about the upcoming birth from the couples who already know that they are pregnant, and from one couple who wants to become a happy owner of the information that they too are expecting. Three different couples, six people of different genders, different ages, experiences, attitudes and social positions. Some â those who had three children â afraid that now their lives will not be like they wanted them to be â spending their old age for themselves. But at the same time, they have no choice because they accidentally became pregnant. When the last of their baby has graduated from the college, they celebrated and accidentally overdo it., , Another couple who is just starting to live themselves is college graduates (between the past and this pair there is no family ties, as one might be assumed logically), the knowledge of a new child turns their world upside down, and their first reaction is fear. Fear that they will not deal it, fear before all unknown and the uncertainty in the tomorrow day., , Very good staging of joint and single acts is a distinctive feature of this musical. Without it, there would be no interest in watching it. Without a good investment of experience of older pair and a charming expression of young couples who are in the age ranges between 20â30 and 30â40, the production would be just another usual treatise about inevitable cycle of life â children growing up, the fear of a newâ¦ All cumulatively â the book, the choreography and the acting, in which you believe, give a definite interest in everything happening on stage. Does it merit of actors, director or anyone else that the musical did not last on the scene for a couple of seasons? Probably not. They did everything that depended on them to make this musical lively and understandable to as many viewers as possible. Is it bad that it only lasted for a couple of seasons? Rather, it is the inevitable whirlwind of life."
"34","Bad Girls ","    Very rich story about what takes place in prison. According to the directors, everyone are singing and dancing. Let we make allowances for the fact that this is still the musical. By focusing on the story, we note that there is a suicide, multiple â pretty explicit â hints of an act of physical intercourse, which often occur in this evil prison world with a completely corrupt guards. In addition, there are scenes of one-gender physical attraction and love against the backdrop of harsh reality â where even your life, not just some ephemeral human rights â depend on today's mood of your supervisor. However, with the passage of time, little has changed and the prisonâs world has definitely remained tough, with the possible exceptions from certain countries such as Sweden, where there are really correctional facilities, rather than the nightmare that is inherent to United Kingdom or to the USA., , It seems that in this musical play only actor depicting Jim Fenner is well â just Goosebumps from his disgusting nature! Most of the rest, as it seemed to us, just depicts some mischiefs. Costumes are bright, but who can really believe that in prison you can afford to wear such outrageous fashions? Though it is clear that even behind the walls, every woman who has not lost faith in herself, and her appearance, will try to look her best and give her gray image, albeit meager, but feasible additions that adorn her. For example, even in a world of zombies, from which a couple of seasons they were hiding behind the walls of the prison, in the best TV serial movie about the post-zombie-apocalyptic world, The Walking Dead, everyone was trying to stand out while remaining herself., , The creators have tried to make the transfer of truthful harsh reality of prison to a musical format by combining and linking comic farce, dances, dialogues and rigid daily. The lump turned psychedelic, not always pleasing the observer because of its vibrant expression of our internal defects that are amplified in a small room for many times., , The characters are different â and those who already understand the nuances of life in the dungeons or the newcomers who does not. There is a struggle for a place (among supervisors) and the struggle within the society of prisoners. In addition, as they are all women, the struggle for ""a place under the sun"" is much more insidious and assertive than men do., , Some say that this play is the first, which shows the lesbian relations between the main characters. But what is more entertaining â it is not only the almost complete dominance of women in the quantity, but also among those who did the play itself â only 4 out of 17 people are men., , That's right, it seems to us, that this musical did not get to Broadway â the audience could not accept this play and it would be closed more quickly than it was closed in UK. It can be concluded that the bad girls are not so much as guards boys are."
"35","Bajour ","    Bajour can be translated as extortion of money by using the techniques of neuro-linguistic programming, known among the masses as NLP. While doing this musical, no one was familiar with this term, because it had not been invented yet. But the concept existed for a long time before and gypsies used it broadly. All this expressions â ""Let me tell fortunes on your arm"", ""Gild the handle & Iâll tell you the whole destiny"", ""Young man, do you want to know your fate?"" â and others show how well gypsies familiar with human psychology and NLP techniques. And if only you succumbed to their tricks â you immediately find yourself on the hook. At best, theyâll leave you without a couple of dollars in your pocket. At worst â without your golden chain, or even dental crowns. And even life can be lost if you will be attacked by their flock., , The musical also touches these topics. Furthermore, they are now intertwined with the fate of one of the main characters â who studies the culture and psychology of the gypsy tribe for her scientific work to become a Ph.D. And the second main character is a future father-in-law of a girl who shamelessly robbed a mother of researcher. Father-in-law and the researcher interact with each other during the second storyline., , Critics point that the play differed with bright colors, talented actors, beautiful & lush costumes, great music, and supernatural choreography. However, what can be seen in the records attached here with own eyes, the same brightly (and it is possible that we can present it in an equally trusty turns of speech to prove absolutely different point of view) suggests otherwise. Everything here is just mediocre, starting with the script â that can be told in a few words without necessity to make a musical â ending with the acting of the most crew. The only bright moment can be passionate dance of Chita Rivera, who was so fiery on stage that she had sparks flowing from under her feet."
"36","Baker's Wife","    Production took place for the first time in 1952 and is still running in different places â for example, in London in 1989, New Jersey in 2005, Australia in 2007, New York in 2007, Canada in 2011, again New York in 2015 and London too in 2015. But it never reached Broadway, despite the fact that there was always good and thoroughly things as a strong plot and the game of actors. It turns out that we have frankly a good thing, in ascension of which there is no necessity to invent fanciful words (which often use theater reviewers, when they need to write something enchanting about the blatant muddy heresy). Pity, it did not reach Broadway, although have crossed several oceans of the globe and, in fact, well showed itself around the world., , Charlie Owens & Alyson Rosenfeld played the main characters in the last show in The Drayton Arms Theatre, in London, but in general, it is strange that in France the play did not appear even once, although it is an adaptation of story, which occurred precisely in the French small town. The basis is the film of 1938, which reflected very romantic spirit of a small town, where not only all the inhabitants know each other, but also they have absolutely nothing at all going on in their lives. All the same routine every day, that someone may call as reliable stability, and someone sees an incredibly boring swamp that sucks you in and you burn out from the inside, as all your aspirations, dreams and hopes melt out like a candle, when living in a place as such., , Very accurate presentation of the plot carried out by all actors through the prism of the variability of their sentiments. The new man in town? Oh, how wonderful it is â now we will have bread and you can talk to the newcomers! His wife ran off with a young lover? Oh, how wonderful, why donât we have this in our own lives? He is a heartbroken because of the escape of his half? Oh, what a bitch, she is a traitor! She's back? Oh, how happy they are now together again! However, it is the usual thing that people are chameleons in their preferences and points of view â because the world is changing and we must adapt to it., , ""Golden ages"", reflected there are ones that the French love to remember and which so often can be seen in early films with Louis de FunÃ¨s â where in bright colors unsophisticated rural people are shown and their pure, sincere emotions â sadness, joy and others. Chuck Sisson as the baker is very convincing â he worries that his wife (Khaki Pixley) takes fun with a young guy (trying to convince himself that it is to her mother she went, not to lover). Then he forgives her when she comes back, humiliated and shamed. He showed great generosity taking her back, because he loves her more than life, and there are no mistakes that could not be forgiven., , Meadowlark â a song that is full of delight and is composed so as not to leave the other emotions besides of shocking aesthetic beauty that comes from it., , In spite of the 18 people involved in the show, the baker and his wife naturally take all the attention on themselves, as it should be if the main actor is good in his character."
"37","Bare A Pop Opera ","    Would you were interested when almost all the cast of the show sitting back to you on the stage, but you like what's going on? With the show named Bare: A Pop Opera, you will be interested. Simply because in this moment, all eyes fixed on the priest, who convincingly broadcasts from his pedestal. But what, apart from the priests, must settle thrill of watching in our souls? Strong relationships between young people of both genders and almost never they tend to hetero. Most vivid emotions occur in those who are in puberty â when falling in love, breaking apart is very bright, and even when it is possible making such apparent madness like committing suicide., , The plot is the love between two boys, their remoteness and convergences in this regard. Spoilers will not be here â because this opera took place in 2004. Many of its variants still continues to play around the world â it is really liked by the studentâs community. And now, 11 years later, it saw the world again, all continents, and who knows â may it be that now, while you are reading this description, this play is showed by some students in their home university., , The plot is very touching â in fact, not so much because of the theme of one-gender relations, which is some 100 years ago was considered a complete taboo by Catholic Church, but more because a lack of understanding by society and by the people close to you. The strongest thing, which causes many millions of people end their lives with suicide â a lack of understanding from others. Because a human being is highly social creature, for many it is difficult to realize that the true wealth is not in the way how you are seen and taken by people around, but a fulfillment with harmony within yourself. And everything around â trees, temples, sea, air and people â are just tools for you to achieve such a state of nirvana, which will bring you a calming peace of mind. But to achieve even half of this understanding, you should be, above all, spiritually wealthy person with a very interesting inner world that elevates you above the miserable little worlds of all others around, even in the beginning of your journey. The characters of the play do not differ with above and are bright examples of oppressing a person by separation from surrounding, including the orientation. Like many hidden and opened gays, one of them has a child from the girl, but he will not be happy (or unhappy) father, because he commits suicide., , Very slippery topic, but everything else is secondary and shallow, so because of it, it is famous for staging by students, amateurs and professionals. And it is true, as evidenced by numerous performances in recent years. For example, in Basement Arts, the play was totally free, as the exhibition was done by actors-beginners, still gaining their skills."
"38","Bark! The Musical ","    Michael Laun â director, Jacob Montoya â responsible for the choreography. Sacramento Theater hosted play in LA before the time when, in the wave of its success, a second production in Chicago was opened., , Very positive actors, interesting and minimalistic display of being a one of the dog breed â only a few fur items like kneepads, leashes and funny nuances like the collarbones. All of them depict some breed, from a very tough guy like bulldog, to completely gentle creature such as a pink poodle. Each tells own story. Someoneâs story is very compassionate and someoneâs is so funny that you think that youâll burst now from laughter., , Production did not come to Broadway because it was not originally conceived as a purely theatrical show. Rather, it is fun and unusual fundraising programme that sprinkles with its naturalness, the complete absence of pathos, which is often inherent to many theatric snobs that do infinitely boring performances for themselves and for others like them. Here, the opposite is true â you will not get bored even for a minute and will not have to keep in mind the tedious half tones of play of classic actors who are endlessly confusing and too dramatized. There are only 6 characters and each of them is in one way or another is charming dog that you immediately imbued with sympathy to. Because, unlike those pesky humans, dogs do not know how to pretend, they are sincere in everything â joy, anger, and even when obnoxious. We love them so much more than surrounding us human biomass that ugly captivated the entire planet., , Adorable characters are not all. Many of the actors have stunning voices, and they make their songs to be highlights of the program as they sing as if want to fill with the voice all available space. 23 songs in total were written by M. Winkler, J. Heath, G. G. Dillard, D. Lukic & R. Schrock. Gavin Geoffrey Dillard â the composer who wrote the music, and in addition, worked on the lyrics., , What is this musical tries to depict? The most important thing â that dogâs needs are very small, and the return of their emotions will be enormous if you will just love them. Even if they pee on the carpet â it is not out of malice, but because they may not know yet that there is a special tray for this. Take a dog from a shelter â pay with your warmth and kindness to those who are not so fortunate as you. To those who do not have a home, and who freezes to the cold outdoors to the bones, nibbling food frosted in the pavement. That's the depiction of this musical."
"39","Barnum ","    As we can see on one of the photos â obviously, a collage of several roles of all members of the circus troupe that star in this production â there are as many as a hundred people. Of course, this is not true â so many of them at the same time have never been on the stage in this play. In addition, the director of the circus is more in the size than an elephant â a clear profanation. What is more likely to be the truth is a group photo of the actors, directors and all those who made this show â they are just 43 people., , The show is very theatrical, bright and, as usual in such cases â absolutely little-meaningful. Some meaning, of course, is there â in the course of the story is told that a certain person by name of whom this bright costumed show with a lot of hype was called, does some show-biz staging in his life and for this reason, is wildly loved by surrounding persons. Basically, thatâs it., , Mark Bramble â the man who wrote the libretto for this show, and Cy Coleman is a composer who favorably underlined with his notes the voice capabilities of all actors of this play., , Everything revolves around the idea of circus performances, and even expression from the stage as if all the spectators were inside of the circus. One of the main ideas exploited here is that the whole showbiz is a great deception, and it does not produce anything real â just a farce; people are stuffed with bright expression, vividness, without taking anything real from any show. True, it is served rather one-sided, because even the ancient philosophers noticed that the most important things for people are bread and show. And people truly willing to pay for such an intangible thing as a spectacle, with hard cash. Although occasionally here and there, different ideas arise, that point that show business is a fake all-through. And that those viewers who were standing when applauded you yesterday, today are engaged in their daily businesses, and even donât want to know who you are. Every actor who think that deeply, have to live with that thought."
"40","Bat Boy ","    Suffice bloodthirsty musical â it is the aggregation of our personal opinion about it after watching. We are greeted with such exotic experiments with the plot of the musical like incorporal fertilization of woman by the flock of bats, which were get on her because of the experimental material was shed on her in some kind of laboratory. We also met incest of sister and her brother-mutant, constant murders, a violation of medical ethics, blood thirst, holding humanoid creatures in a cage, as well as the outright hostility of the population towards the newcomer. But that's not all â the latter is some vampire-like creature that eats only raw blood (no matter whose one â from cattle, other animals or humans). Well, and now goes the control shot â this is a comedy. Not all, of course. Drama is there, but comedy often prevails. An ingenious blend of genres, vortex, in which we are immersed thanks to the excellent play on stage of everyone who creates such a nice image of the earth Nosferatu., , In the story, the inhabitants of some village with a heartbreaking name Hope Falls â failure of hopes â find a man-vampire in the local cave who feed with the blood. In the course of the story, we learn that one, though declaring his alleged friendliness, permanently kills someone. Cattle or people. And the doctor, who sheltered him, also killing a lot of people to blame the Bat guy in this. But we go further and it turns out that the doctor is his father, who conceived him in a seizure of frenzied uncontrolled passion under the influence of narcotic drug a long time ago, and the girl he raped, was subjected to the same torture, but by a flock of bats â thatâs why such unhandsome baby was born. But his father was not enough of that, and he threw the newborn monster in the cave, so that he died there. But the boy was not a goose and lived through about 18 years with a flock of bats, who lived in the same cave and along the way, are his biological parents. Daddy wants to permanently kill his sonny, in the process he loses the rest of the children (and there were a minimum of two), and then killed by the same vampire who penetrated in his daughter and then a monster killed his mother. Are you enough? Forest deities in their diversity. Its just a worshiping of Anima!, , It is just a nightmarish horror that will not come to mind of mentally healthy person, and even depicting such a character should be repugnantly disgusting. Nevertheless, it all is portrayed in such a way that it turns out a comedy, not a thriller-horror with wide rivers of blood so that the first row of viewers were covered with fountains of blood of this vampireâs life-giving substance. By the way, we have a sneaking impression that people are aware of the bats only that they are vampires â whereas this is terrible lie. Only a couple of species of them drink the blood. The others eat insects and fruits. Therefore, Bat kid would with a huge probability be grown on apples, grasshoppers and other things like that, but not on blood. Either the story must be shifted outside the US, in Africa, where the most part of bloodsuckers truly live."
"41","Beautiful Game","    Quite an interesting story from the perspective of the viewer from the UK â first, because of football. The game, which popularized throughout the world, starting from the UK. The game of many people and many money, game that unites even political opponents. Secondly, because there is a love story in the musical, but we have to admit, it is very flat and expected â the coolest boy in the local football team dates a girl from cheerleaders. Thirdly â and this is the strongest storyline â in a variety of negative colors told how terrible Irish Republican Army is. These are the people that inspired by the same idea â that beautiful and long-suffering Ireland must regaine its freedom and independence from their oppressors â England, whose troops had once conquered the fertile Irish lands, killed many and enslaved others under their yoke, out of which they cannot escape for many centuries. Just like the Scots, the people of the mountains, proud and independent. Beautiful and free, no matter that their enslaved by the same breed of invaders, who were more aggressive, angry, and surpassed with number. And now, thanks to the efforts of England, IRA officially considered as a terrorist organization. And for what? That they are fighting for their freedom, for their self-determination, for their country and the constitution! Yes, not all the methods they use are acceptable â but how to do else, when England â big neighbor â does not sit down on a civilized negotiation table? In the wake of this strong story line â as on the rod, spins musical, which is quite different seen in England and Ireland (as well as in Scotland, who are familiar with the topic). The first thought that the IRA are the dregs that have no place on the Earth's surface, while the latter believe that IRA are nice fellows, enthusiastically going to watch this musical. Only to be disappointed â IRA is displayed here from the point of view of the policy of Britain, and not the Irish., , What is remarkable the viewer sees, besides the ideas of independence? Corny love story that is covered with dust â a boy meets a girl, falls in love, get married and they having a child who goes on the sports after his father's footsteps. In parallel, we see how a career of chief male protagonist develops â while his wife is like nobody â cheerleader, remained no one â abandoned by him without a job and with baby on the neck. Abandoned because her husband went to London to fight for the ideals of his new world â on the side of IRA., , Musical is categorically cheerless and completely predictable, despite the fact that it was working-through by a master, Andrew Lloyd Webber, who always puts its stamp of quality on everything he touches. As far as we can judge by the criticâs opinions â music of the show is fantastically good. Everything else, including the hideously elaborated main storyline â as the protagonist imbued with beliefs of IRA â you can endlessly criticize."
"42","Beautiful The Carole King ","    Carole King is the girl who at first was the writer of songs for others and from under her pen came many hits. For example, The Locomotion, Beautiful and Be-Bop-A-Lula, together with Who Put the Bomp. Her other song â Will You Love Me Tomorrow â is still sung by many, because it is very versatile â it can be done both slow and fast, and even in the disco style. Whereas Who Put the Bomp strongly associated with Jive and Boogie Woogie., , She was a preacher of the musical style of her time, and we will hear in the musical even more bright songs, that are sang with heart and soul, pursuing remnants of sadness, because under such wonderful songs no one can be sad. By the way, this is one of the few musicals that goes right now, as you read this description â throughout 2015 and until almost the end of 2016 there is a tour on the United States. It brings a bright mood to everyone who has decided to leave a couple of hours of their time in the auditorium to enjoy good old songs that still very not soon will be out of fashion., , Once this woman has found her great voice, in combination with her talent for versification, she had no choice but to become a mega-popular, to release a bunch of albums, singles, and to receive numerous awards during her life's journey. She is still actively involved in the music and in the political life of the country, her opinion is rated. She is now 73 years old, but she has a good mood every day â that happens to a successful person who likes what she does., , The musical is filled with live hits to give examples to many modern songs as how the classics of pop sound should be, and many other genres. How much weight gives only âWill You Love Me Tomorrowâ â this song is of several decades â but it is still covered and loved by many., , Mueller, which plays in the musical Carole herself, many critics praise for the unusually accurate reflection of heat in her voice and in general the accuracy of the manner of behaving., , The musical tells of the early years, the beginning of Kingâs career, as she only came to the world of show business and started making songs for others, who immediately liked by one of the music producers. It is also said about how she met her first husband, Gerry Goffin, who later was burdened by marriage to Carole and she divorced him, although they kept warm relations that contributed to the inner peace of the Carole, both in personal life and creativity., , Carole is one of those who sought to music since early childhood and has learned playing the piano in 4, and in the 16 was selling her songs. Zeal to the music did not ever disappear from her and many hits possess her authorship. You can safely say that this person inclusively was forming the appearance of show business, as we now it know, and deservedly got her star on the Walk of Fame., , Musical is for all â both who is familiar and not with Carole King, but just loves good music and visits shows to enjoy music above all."
"43","Bells Are Ringing ","    The first pair of musical performances were really worthy â because they were made by people of their time in the current realities. Who knows now what the telephone company with manual commutation is? Now everything is made automatically, completely displacing this manual labor. Therefore, all subsequent resurrections of this musical have been unsuccessful due to lack of re-thinking of the plot. If it is to adapt to the new â modern â world that so much has changed since 1960, it would have to change just about anything. The place where the main character works and how she meets a new husband, and what police is doing with it all-around weak shown second storyline â where the telephone company is used as a kind of unsecured channel for some fraud of a gang., , To be honest, this musical is a completely outdated both in the shell in which it is presented, and in the entourage that is tried to be created. After all, if to think about it, the main character is a poor woman. She is past 40, she works as a gray telephone operator, she has neither children, nor husband and her job is rubbish. She isnât shiny with her beauty, and if to wash her makeup â the expression ""isnât shiny"" will receive an entirely different color and will sound more like ""beauty is gone, along with her make-up"". In such circumstances, it is unclear why to fall in love with someone like her but she still keeps up to do the love intrigues with unabashed ease as the younger generation, to whom she does not belong anymore. For what to love her is not disclosed in the musical. Despite this, the rich and wealthy man â writer and, no doubts, the owner of a rich inner world â somewhat falls in love with her. This is very far from real life, and if we extrapolate it at the reality, their marriage is doomed to collapse after a maximum of a couple of years â they are simply physically different people, from various circles & even worlds. Yes, her singing is certainly good, but it is the only plus. This is a very weak competitive plus in today's world of mega temptations., , The first revival of the musical was unsuccessful â the weak reviews and hostility between the actors and creators. The second possessed very mediocre success â only the leading actress shined with the stage talent. Everything else is necessary to erase and to develop from scratch. To add bright colors, to remove plaque of naphthalene from everything that is presented on the stage and to completely rewrite the characters, the story and circumstances. Will it be considered as the creation of a completely new musical? Maybe yes. But in other conditions its existence is simply impossible â nobody understands and accepts the bygone days and, therefore, everything that happens seems to be some strange surreal farce. You donât believe it anymore and understand that something must be changed seriously."
"44","Ben Franklin in Paris ","    Quite ""non-standard"" musical, as some critics say. Because it depicts a lot of historical events, which are made out and only based on real events of 1776. When the father of democracy, Benjamin Franklin was trying to get the support from the second largest country of that time â France (to be able to win the political support of newly born country â the USA â so it was approved by them to receive the military and political aid), because the first country â England â was the one with whom he had fought. In the end, the King of France recognizes it and makes him the official ambassador, reinforcing his authority as the leader of the state and acting in defiance of Britain, showing his royal ambitions., , But this musical not so much shows the political part of the incident as ""true"", in terms of the creators, reasons why the King did so and not otherwise. Here it goes a made-up story â allegedly Benjamin Franklin had an intrigue in Paris in the face of Madame Diane de Vobrillac, which was a favorite of the king and had a huge impact on him. To her personal favor â say the creators of the musical â we are obliged to the emergence of such a powerful country as the USA. That is, the fate of an entire continent, world, and the most influential center of life solved then in 1776 not on the battlefield, although there is, of course, too, but in the beds of three people and two couples â Diane de Vobrillac and Benjamin Franklin & King of France and Diane de Vobrillac. From the point of view of modern medicine science if talking of exchange with fluids and bacteria, it is equivalent that Benjamin Franklin had slept with the King of France. To some extent, it is possible that this insidious subtext was trying to be reflected by the creators of the musical. Well, if so, they certainly have engendered some doubts in our minds., , As to the whole play, that all its components are quite enough to entertain the crowd during the couple of seasons, during which the musical shone on the stages of Broadway. 1964 was a year of much inspiration, spring moods and incredible stretch of imagination when various theatrical actions were created. This musical also werenât capable avoiding some frivolity and even after the resurrection it did not last long, thanks to the clear reluctance of Americans to recognize the historical superiority of France. Or perhaps the story of the attainment of independence already stuffed on edge and we all just have to move on."
"45","Bernarda Alba ","    Michael John LaChiusa is the composer, who wrote the lyrics to this play, which reflects a certain frivolously adaptation of Victor Hugo, who wrote something similar in his works. Nevertheless, the writer is actually a Hispanic Federico GarcÃ­a Lorca, who wrote something grim and dark that even played in the respective colors on the scene. All dressed always in black, lighting is very similar to single light bulbs in the cellar, and the mood of the heroines â that's right, heroines, because there are no heroes â very sad and tensed at the same time., , On stage, in the absence of men, a very high degree of intensity depicted. Men are constantly mentioned, but the girls â daughters of insanely strict mother â are not allowed to have affairs as long as they all have for insanely long 8 years wear mourning after the dead husband of their mother. Despite the ban, they begin to contradict and argue with and the viewer learns even that one of them is going to get married â and her fiancÃ© â what a prick â apparently does so only for the money, while inciting on another, the youngest, daughter, which is exactly 2 times younger than the eldest sister., , In general, this is some kind of homemade terror, when young women, having no access to the male body, sight and touch, are starting to go crazy. And everything ends with a huge negative pressure, when one of them â the youngest â in a fit of unrealized feelings, hangs herself., , Dances that are implemented on the stage, is expressive in the Latin American style, but monotonous â the same rhythm goes with all the same lack of development along the way."
"46","Best Foot Forward ","    Ralph Blane & Hugh Martin wrote the songs for the musical and Ethel Barrymore Theatre hosted successful 326 performances. Actress Nancy Walker was a debutant in this musical on Broadway. Miles White was responsible for dress, and Jo Mielziner â for lightning. Together with a director and producer George Abbott and choreographer Gene Kelly, they worked with a team of smiling actors on creation of entertaining musical, which has successfully pleased the audience. In 1943, a year after the completion of it on Broadway, the film came out, where they repeated the whole story of Broadwayâs show., , Lucille Ball starred in the film, as well as the familiar Allyson and Walker. Rosemary Lane, a pity, did not take part in it, although at that time she was already an actress. Moreover, the TV adaptation came out in 1954, and the revival of the musical took place in 1963, however, this time less successfully â only 224 shows on Broadway. Danny Daniels was the director this time and a significant part in it took Liza Minnelli, who made her debut in this musical. Eventually she won numerous awards in her life, including the prestigious Theatre World Award. The other main actor was Christopher Walken â person of different roles, which is known to many for the ghost rider of Sleepy Hollow and in the role of the army guy, who gave to the hero of young Bruce Willis watch in the film Pulp Fiction by Tarantino. His acting talent, certainly holds a lot more roles, but these are the ones that come to mind immediately. In the musical, he was a youngster with sullen look., , Regarding the play of 1963, it is worth noting that many critics praised it because of the liveliness of the characters that simply radiated energy of their youth to outside, so much that many even thought that it was too much. A pair of dull critics who have not achieved anything in their lives, wrote caustic reviews on the musical like they had too many youth and it's bad, because blah blah blah. And the others, normal ones, life-satisfied people have written the truth â the musical was swarming with positive energy and excellent stage zeal. Some of the flaws that really could be due to youth of actors, over the top compensated by their diligence, striving for accuracy performance of their roles and great vivacity that accompanied them all along., , The most important thing for what it is worth to go on this musical is a great choreography, when all on stage move as if a single organism, having thoughtful dialogues and fiery spirit of youth that sparks from everywhere. What is not felt at all â any tension, so nothing is unnatural and this musical is sitcom, situation comedy, with joy and a little admixture of warm farce. If situations like this happen in the real life, all experience embarrassment or anger by unforeseen circumstances, more than the joy because of our dull reality has experiences fluctuations. Should it be otherwise? Maybe. The song Shady Lady Bird is not present in the film, but it gives just another reason to visit the play to see this bright and happy show."
"47","Best Little Whorehouse in Texas","    The brothel, which has existed for about 100 years, should be called something unremarkable so it was not obvious to the authorities and did not use excessive glory that would attract undesirable attention. Needed people know that Chicken House is not a factory for the production of chickens and eggs. This is where the other chicks will execute any your desire, no matter how endlessly dirty would it be. The musical shows the positive image of the brothel where all its workers are happy with what they do, no one has any references to the ugliness of the occupation and the general sale of bodies of girls expressed as caring of the health of men who use their services, because it is the place they renew their health in every way. Of course, it goes without saying that all the girls are clean and are generally feel the high zeal for the profession â even sing of it and love beautiful, but transparent outfits., , Dolly Parton starred â as the owner of the place of entertainment â in the movie of 1982, because it was so sugary and pink, as if made of rose caramel syrup in the form of a bow. Here, the viewer is presented with even a kind of morality of what all these people do â contrary to public opinion and common sense. And the closure of a brothel â around which revolves the main storyline â has more cons rather than pros. By the way, closing took place as a result of investigative journalistâs work by some youngster, who is a zealous guardian of morals and a follower of Christian denominations who writes impartial article about what is done here., , In general, the journalist got a finger to the sky, because only imbecilic person does not know what is being done in brothels. In the musical audience is being touted of it as a big omission â because so many people are now deprived of work. So many men (and sometimes, even women) will no longer have satisfaction in life. Everyone should, of course, decide â if (s)he is OK with what (s)he sees on the scene or not. In any case, it seems to us, the attitude to this social phenomenon each one formed long before visiting this musical (or movie), so perhaps that is possible to contemplate just yet a point of view â a new one or comparable to yours., , Besides the main displayed bulges, there are also some issues of corruption (bribery of the sheriff who protects this âhome of sensual pleasuresâ). Choreography is good, and almost all sing constantly. Clothing â above all praise, if you are a man with a normal range of emotions inside. And it is awful, vulgar and (pick yourself the following terms) if you are a woman or a man of puritan â outdated â views on life. Anyway, it seems as if you're not in the theater but in a brothel. At least, it is fun."
"48","Best of Broadway","    Listening to The Music Of The Night, it is impossible to break away from it as Michael Crawford has so charming voice, just wow! And when it is superimposed on the stringed instruments â violin and bass, on top being supplemented with a gentle piano, as well as a pair of wind instruments, supplementing violins and upper registers of his voice, it just feels like you want to give in to this lulling-threatening voice of diabolical Michael., , Good Morning Baltimore travels to our ears with the roll-truck of fun and good mood without any reason, which is from the mouth of a little girl sounds as attempts to be just vainly fun according to the scenario. Her clean vocal does not tarnish from this, but rather looks very nice., , One is a very famous melody, which is ideal for the nature and the magic of Broadway â it has the touch of glamor, fun and exciting beauty of backstage and the ease with which made a lot of musicals â at least the viewer from the hall sees it so., , There's No Business Like Show Business â the song that is characterized by strong vocals and is the star of the show named Annie Get Your Gun, which, though not very successful itself, gave the world this melody that is remembered by many theater-goers., , Ol' Man River â a beautiful voice with a jazz accompaniment, which is difficult to forget. It is velvety, giving voluptuously pleasuring sound., , I Could Have Danced All Night â it's a pure voice of Audrey Hepburn, and all is said with it â the actress who is beautiful as an angel, and as pure as the morning dew on the green leaf. The magic of her playing and singing will always be with us., , If I Were A Rich Man â a strong male voice who sings in the folk genre something about how he would realized his dreams of a big house, if he would be a rich man and wise as King Solomon. And he naively believes that if he was rich, he would have had plenty of time just to sit in the synagogue and to pray, or that he would filled his yard with geese, ducks and other animals â as it seems to him, the outer side of wealth., , Cabaret is just a greeting card of Liza Minnelli, where she reveals fully. She is all in this â the public person, feeling on stage as if it would be her pedestal, which helps a big number of others to see her talent and herself â without such intimate openness she does not see herself. Even the fish in the water does not feel as uninhibited and confident, like Liza on stage. She is bright, fantastically direct, not constrained, she was born for the stage and seemed to be was born on the stage. She is stunning actress also â at least in this video that you see on this website â and she symbolizes all the world of show business with herself. The same relentlessly bright, capable of any eccentricity, if only people looked at her and admired!, , The rest of the music, whether it is Let The Sunshine In, who is acted with a complete range of incomprehension, despair and inability to change something when you mistakenly sent to war â each song is full of. Full of professionalism, performance, emotion, vividness, making this collection to be the best selection from Broadway."
"49","Big Fish ","    Based on the original novel and on John Augustâs screenplay adaptationâ August contributes the book here â this stage rendition covers the same territory but has a very different take on the material from Tim Burtonâs film.  Itâs subdued where the film was overeager, beginning with the earth tones of Julian Crouchâs set design, an elegant assembly of irising wood slats that give a nod to the Southern setting while allowing for a series of total transformations, often with the help of fantastic projections, costumes, and lighting that enable, for example, tree roots to suddenly become people., , Emotionally the show is simplified where the film was a touch muddy; it smartly sacrifices a degree of Burtonâs sophisticated depth for a more accessible relationship between father and son and between reality and fantasy.  Whereas in the film the character of Edward Bloom was played as a young man by Ewan McGregor and as an old man by Albert Finney, he is here embodied at all ages by the wondrous Norbert Leo Butz (âDirty Rotten Scoundrels,â âCatch Me if You Canâ), an approach that on the one hand allows Butz to display his extraordinary range of talents and also provides a more direct, undivided emotional connection to the character., , In the argument between the story-loving Edward and his literal, skeptical son Will (Bobby Steggert), this version exposes the depth of emotion early with an angry confrontation and song â âThis River Between Usâ â but also takes a clear stand in the fight.  âYou gotta dream big,â Edward tells the 6-year-old Will (Zachary Unger), âor youâre never gonna have a big life.â  And Willâs mother (an excellent Kate Baldwin) both explains her husbandâs storytelling and admonishes her son:  âEach word becomes a poem / Each sentence filled with joy, / Canât you try to be your fatherâs boy?â  And finally, when Will asks the family doctor about the day he was born, a day that Edward has turned into the title tale of a big fish which became the opening number âThe Godâs Honest Truth,â the doctor explains that fantasy can be superior to reality:  âSometimes talkinâ is how a man makes sense of the world.â, , This is where the show finds its most important, simplest success.  Stroman, August, and composer-lyricist Andrew Lippa (âThe Addams Family,â âThe Wild Partyâ) know exactly when the story needs to launch into song, and the tunes take on the varying flavors of whatever adventure Edward relates.  We meet the Witch (Katie Thompson, bringing down the house) who predicts young Edwardâs death, Karl the giant (Ryan Andes, instantly likable) and the carnival barker Amos Calloway (Brad Oscar, phenomenal).   Lippa has never been the most conventional of composers, but heâs a perfect fit for this unconventionally conventional show where he can create a pastiche of Americana., , Not everything works perfectly.  The Act II opening, a patriotic, USO-inspired number depicting Edwardâs fight against a comicbook-like villain, is corny without being fun enough.  But thatâs the rare example of where this show needs refinement.  More generally, by taking Edwardâs tales as the jumping-off point for the theatricality of production numbers, the show makes a case for the musical form itself as a means of privileging imagination over ordinariness.  The show does have a target audience after all, and itâs those who love musicals."
"50","Big ","    Anyone who has not forgotten what it means to ""be a kid"", should definitely watch this musical at least because there are cultivated the most valuable and important values of our lives â sincerity, honesty, fear of being bad and courage to dare to adventure. The musical is about a little boy of 12 years who has become big because of his burning desire â to become adult because it is no fun to be small. We all go through it sooner or later in puberty or childhood, but when it is shown in the film with Tom Hanks, he believe that we would be the same cute, charming and good if we would suddenly matured in the 25-years old guy., , The show, mainly in all terms and turns of the plot, follows the movie and we see as the most clean and light side of the character revealed by his sudden adulthood. And even at a time when he had almost forgotten what it means to be a child and grew up to the state of planning boring evenings with someone who serves as an additional step in your career â he did not blame all around, as adults do, but realized that the problem is in him. And that he betrays his real values that are important for him right now, at this moment. We have no doubts that his hero, when he grows up, will do spend time on boring and not interesting people simply because it is required in the society. If you want to develop and to achieve something, you sometimes must. But as now this life is not ok for him, he wasnât ready to sink into the furnace of the swamp that pulls you in against your will., , Zoltar, which is a strange machine, wish-fulfilling, allowing the boy to grow suddenly into an adult man. And it lets him become little back again leaving him huge experience as a warning to the fact that dreams tend to come true. It is for real â we often want something, do not knowing what is actually expects us in the end of our desires. What if you actually will gain USD 100 million, as you have dreamt of? Will you be able not to lose your head, and behind it â yourself and money with your life, when suddenly rushed headlong into the maelstrom of disorderly expenses of such a fantastic wealth? Or if you would suddenly find yourself a beautiful, slender, sultry, tanned and just ""candy"" in all other respects, as you have dreamt of? Wonât you get tired of flurry of attention that youâll suddenly experience? (On this occasion, by the way, there is a good movie from the USSR times)., , The moral of this musical lies on the surface â be careful what you wish for â dreams come true!"
"51","Big River ","    First of all, it is worth noting a large scale of the show on Broadway on such parameters as: costumes, stage design (especially moving platforms that depicted rafts are noteworthy), as well as stage props such as guns. Actors sing with great feelings â much-worthy a song of slaves, driven back into slavery on the raft, The Crossing. Its female vocals deserve special attention â they just dig inside of the soul., , The classic story of Mark Twain experienced hundreds of adaptations and productions of all levels â both amateur and professional ones. This musical grew more than one, rather, 3-4 generations of people who are fans of all good â both of what made Mark Twain, and what this performance represents., , First of all, there is the spirit stands out, enclosed in a rebellious look at things of the protagonist â Huckleberry Finn, even whose very name symbolizes the inconspicuous, but very delicious berry that grows where the wind will bring its embryos. Capricious plant, as well as a very self-willed and free-spirited character of Huck. He's like a tumbleweed or, if you prefer better, a rolling stone â after the wind, adventures, ahead in obscurity, even if it is dangerous to life or health. The spirit of romanticism vehemently dimmed in adults who are crushed with commonplace â work, caring their households, earning money and worrying of the sour milk in a saucer of the pregnant cat. That is, when you fully grasped with the quagmire of ""stability"", which gives you a penny in your pocket, but flatly denies that rollicking mood of vagrancy, researchers, adventure, romantics of the road, the ringing wind in the ears and fullness of boominess of night space filled with crickets. Or with water noise of the river, along which travels a couple of main characters â Huck and the runaway slave Jim., , Huckleberry cannot imagine himself sitting in one place, doing incomprehensibly boring things of every dayâs life, when you need to do the same things day by day, until the complete dullness and inevitable moment when you will be embanked with the wet earth. Isnât it interesting to start dancing in the evening with the falling sun on the top of the mountain, knowing that your lungs are filled with rarefied air, and your mind is pride of the ascent? Isnât it exciting to miss your plane with no money in your pocket when you have to fly one-third of the globeâs surface? Exactly such adventures you will remember for many years after their achievement. But not how you eat fried potatoes in 20 minutes after you fried it. But if you do it in the campfire, impaling a piece of bacon for roasting on a stick, and night stars will serve you as the blanket, and in the morning you will suddenly meet a snake face to face â it will be a huge adventure! That is the character of Huckleberry. He personifies something many of us are unable of. Live fast, die young. He is just like a rock star! Only without the guitar."
"52","Billy Elliot ","    This shows you want to watch, even if you donât like the theater. If you live in the world of gadgets and smartphones, you are in some way unlucky â it is not so simple to buy the tickets on this musical because they are sold at many views beforehand. Why is that? Because it is one of the most spectacular, fantastically thought-out, with excellent choreography musicals, which youâll want to watch not once but 2 or more times. It had huge budgets around the world, which it consistently paid out. To some extent, it is even a conveyor of employment for many talented boys â the main role of Billie today played more than 100 (just think about this number!) boys all over the world only in professional productions, not to mention how many amateur shows were made., , If you count all shows, which were held for all time to all places of the world â only those which are official and it is known that they were â than the total number will exceed 5000 for sure. Only Broadwayâs show has survived for more than 1,300 regular performances, excluding previews., , What is captivating about this musical, you ask? Costumes, story, songs, choreography, ballet skills, coupled to the leading personâs abilities â that's what. Everything is not just perfectly executed, but performers also look nice, the heart rejoices., , 10 Tony awards werenât given for nothing. In the musical, there are many feelings mixed, but the most important core is a wild desire of a person â a little boy â to express himself, in which he is strongly suppressed by his entourage. He sought to ballet, while was growing up among miners. Who were concerned only with continued strike. They simply have nothing to eat (and at the end of the play we learn that they will be fired altogether because havenât win anything from the administration of the mine). However, they are raising money for the boy on a bus ticket to London, where he tried to enter the school of ballet, and he succeeds and has to leave the city in the end of the performance. Such protection by the seemingly harsh miners is akin to the way that in remote villages, the whole village dresses and provides with food and money one clever son of a local, who goes studying at the university, to give him a chance to become somebody. It's cute, it's sentimental, and even his father, who was himself a miner, changes his mind when he sees as his son dances and how much does he like it. Still, he understands that being a slave in mines for a boy is a coal cell in which he will wither away in a few days., , It is about of strong feelings, fantastically enjoyable adapted for the stage. That is why we're going to watch this musical, to enjoy the absolutely stunning atmosphere that pours upon us during each and every part."
"53","Blood Brothers ","    What do you feel when you hear the number ""10000""? Even if it's just the amount of minutes that should be lived, it is already more than 160 hours, or nearly 7 days. Or $ 10 000? It is a good amount of earnings per month, for example. And what if 10 000 is the number of shows only in London itself, through which has this musical passed? More than 21 years was the main part of its staging, and many ones were before and after, including the USA, Australia, South Africa, Mexico and Canada, Europe & Japan., , For a substantially long duration, the musical has won numerous awards and was noted by many: Laurence Olivier Award (5 nominations, including 3 wins), Drama Desk Award (1 nominations and 1 win), Tony Award (6 nominations). There is even an advertising on its cover stating, that it is the owner of all the possible awards (though a bit presumptuous and exaggerated. In fact, the Tony has not yet been received)., , The story in two parts, says about how the twin brothers were separated at birth and one of them has been adopted by a wealthy couple, and the other remained to his fairly poor mother, who worked as a housewife at that wealthy couple. As a result of the maelstrom of events that takes place every seven years â somewhat magic number â the brothers are first introduced, then fight and kill one another, like Cain did to Abel. And the seconds after another being shot by police. Before his death, the child of a wealthy family expressed his extreme dissatisfaction with his disgusting life and that it could be different. He wanted to be like his twin, who had much more ârealâ life., , You know, it is no matter how you raise the child; (s)he is after some time, maybe in his or her 20 or 50 years, may come to you and say: ""Mom (Dad)! You taught me bad! You made me to be boring lawyer and now all days I have to sit in dusty office, go to boring trials, but I want to be a clown â he spends whole days amusing the audience and lives with a fantastically interesting life of the theater and the circus!â Or he comes to you and says: ""Mother, (father)! You have let me to be a clown â I hate my life! This audience always laughs at me, I'm constantly wearing the make-up, from which my skin is already twice older than me, and still no one takes me seriously! I wanted to be a traveler and discoverer â he is free as a bird, and goes where he wants to, and his life is full of excitement!"". Or: ""Mom (Dad)! Why did you let me to become a traveler! I have now earned sciatica, sleeping in cold tents and scarred because of fighting with rocks and wild animals, and have no stability â whether Iâll be given money for new projects or not. Why wouldnât you forced me to be a lawyer? Here is the stable life â a warm office, silent life, huge salary"". So do not worry about it â your children will still be dissatisfied with your influence on their lives, no matter how great you did â either gave them freedom of choice either not â they are still likely to be dissatisfied with this. Just as in this musical â out of best wishes, they sheltered a baby & gave him more opportunities in life. And in turn, he, like an ungrateful bastard, bothered and became the criminal: a robber, accessory to murder and, in the end, the murderer of his own blood brother. Shame on him!"
"54","Bombay Dreams ","    In the play, or rather, in the scenery of the stage, at first you get surprised of the presence of the swastika. But then, if you're bright enough and advanced in matters of symbolism of the Eastern world, you realize that this character goes its blades not in a clockwise direction but against it. And so, it is not a swastika, but the symbol of peace, fertility and prosperity, and in general it is very common in Asia as a symbol of very positive energy., , However, this is not a musical about symbols. Can you imagine what the Bombay is? If you say that this is a very large city in India, then you'll be right on 5%. This is a huge human anthill, where people are constantly scurrying, streets are buoyant of cars and motorbikes with cyclists. Where it smells with myrrh, spices, street food, sweat of unwashed feet of dervishes, rose perfumes, cow's, milk and cakes, fried rice and maize with sweet potatoes, as well as sandals, sewage and rain. And that's just on the interval of 10 meters that you will pass on any street. Dodging cars will travel in the vicinity of 10 centimeters from you, rushing nimble rickshaws and motorbikes will drive even closer & threaten to shoot you down, if you're not quite dexterous, running across the road, trying not to bump into cows that are just everywhere. This is not to mention snakes, swarms of insects, cigarette butts that are thrown under the feet. Combine this with the buildings in the architecture of the colonial America, architectural deities of millennial traditions of India, and new buildings, which resemble gray cardboard boxes. Put on a picture emerges of the ubiquitous markets, when you are constantly attacked by ones trying to sell anything. Spice it with glamor boutiques, local poor lying on the ground and juicy spots on everyoneâs foreheads. And to top it, add capacious hum of the city, which is constantly moving â conditioned, beep-beeping, full of loud conversations, phone calls, flying birds, the sounds of trading tourists and mooing of cows. And you get about 50% of understanding what is Bombay. For a 100%, visit and see it. And that's the kind of atmosphere we do not get from this musical. It showed the other side of the life of Indians â beautiful & luxurious. Where people are wrapped in turbans, brocade & silk and wear funny shoes with the toes up. Where dancing is the main component of their lives and resolving of issues. Where there is no true suffering, only bright appearance of artists, smiling tanned people, colorful saris and gilded hats, gushing beauty and mesmerizing choreography., , This bright musical event many critics praise, saying mostly good things, which means success. Musical captivates with its organic and that the sum of its parts is a more than one. The synergy involves actors, dance, music, their bright costumes and exotic appearance. Damn, it is simply delightful, without giving any thought even for a moment that you're bored. On the contrary, you are haunted by the thought that the general tone of it can be summed up in the expression ""gracefully and stylishly""."
"55","Book of Mormon","    The musical from the creators of South Park? As much satirical as it sounds, it's also really funny. Who does not trust our word for it â please download at least a couple of seasons of the cartoon and you will boom out of laugh! Roughly the same thing its creators shoved into their Broadwayâs baby. Almost the entire team that made the cartoon, including the producer, Scott Rudin, had a hand in the creation of this monumental masterpiece. , , Besides the fact that there is present a large proportion of humor, there are also such things as the goodness of human values, stories about what is good and what is bad, and the possibility (and sometimes â necessity) to deviate from the canons of the Church, its Bookâs truths and definite scripts to find the path to people to preach the faith. And they will be drawn to you with all their hearts. Even if it requires them to involve not so much a religion as a mixture of Star Wars and Hobbit, embellishing it with preacherâs bright filing and personal charisma. After all, how else, if not on merit of preacher, the appeal to religion of new people holds, where they donât know anything of you before you came to them and this is all new and you are taken hostile? , , Very good music â voices are strong and clear. It would be inexcusable otherwise, because the musical was developed for seven long years, which is an impressive figure for that. The musical has plenty of very much rude, crazy humor, offensive comparisons and the entire arsenal, which is accepted in the South Park show. So, if you somehow miraculously bought a ticket for this play, despite the fact that there are no tickets for closest several or even a dozen of shows in advance, you will be able to fully enjoy the thick humor without embellishment. But do not take offenses of the creators of the show personally â they did not want to offend anyone, when showed that religion and all its Books is a gargantuan drivel, from their point of view. You can stay with your own. Just enjoy the sparkling humor, occasionally writhing in laughter. "
"56","Bounce ","    The musical was originally conceived not in the way as the world saw it during 2008 â 2011. Firstly, a female character which would depict love by women to brothers (or at least, to one of them), were absent. In the second version, it appeared and was widely spread over the storyline. A woman was in both musical acts. In the third version, her character was limited only to the rapid event in the life of one of the brothers â he married her. Also, over time, heterosexuality of one of the brothers was replaced by homosexuality. More colors to the plot were added with it, according to many critics. This line of his affection tightly connected with and personified by character named Hollis Bessemer. He also was connected somehow with the deceased father of the brothers, and then became a passion of one of them., , Musical started for several times and was twice re-written to try and catch that same feeling that was inherent to it only for the third time, which was launched in 2008. What is remarkable â the original musical was shown as vaudeville, in a rather humorous style. And it did not have the focus on the voice data of actors, as is was, for example, in 2011 in Chicago. In the course of the development of the script, the use of the genre of vaudeville was departed into oblivion, when director Stephen Sondheim realized that this would be difficult to benefit from it â format of the play was quite specific., , What are the obvious disadvantages of the show: the inability to focus on the performance of the songs â they are constantly interrupted so the heroes were able to insert a couple of text lines to continue the song. Again, to be interrupted by the same reason some while after. Very annoying technique that spoils the impression. It is not one or two heroes take such a sin but all â so it was a deliberate choice of Stephen Sondheim. Next â disunity of the storyline. Our heroes are moved quite extensively in space to meet periodically with the old heroes, uniting and separating. Their geography covers almost the entire globe. And along with this, they perform different tasks in every new location â it is difficult to trace the core, which we are trying to reveal. They are either managing the development of construction of the city in the sunny south, or looking for the gold mines in Alaska, and then engaged in what might be described as hedonism, somewhere in the resort among rich people., , Musical pros are undeniably powerful vocals of both main characters, played by Richard Kind (who plays Addison) and Howard McGillin (Wilson). They are perfectly portrayed the feelings of own characters and their relationships, when alternately one, then the second take off and fall, meet, help each other and soar to new heights. It is the inevitable circle of life, which was quite well reflected in this play."
"57","Boy Friend","    This musical is a pretty tenacious staging, which lived for many time in live repertoire â for 5 years. It played in London in 1953, and then until the 2011 was staging on several continents and in general has given more than 3,000 performances. Who knows when it will be the following resurrection? But there is no doubts that it will be., , This show is a musical comedy in which events unfold around the girls who visit the school for noble girls. Of course, they are in puberty â just when you want all, a lot and often. But we also do not forget that we are in England, and so they not only have the appropriate accent, but they still possess fairly low-key parents who are very strict and too mentoring. And some of them are so afraid of an attempt to steel their property and wealth that forbid their daughters to meet any guys. This not only lowers girlsâ self-esteem (because they are beginning to think that boys can meet them only because of the money of their families, and not because of them), but also abhorrent to the normal development of social relationships. Which, as it seems in this age, is critically important. However, for the development of an independent person, such meetings and relations with all, and most of all â with the opposite gender â are very important when your body goes through hormonal changes and mental transformations., , Despite the rather formal statement of the position of adolescents above, the musical is displayed far less boring and much more brightly. For example, we meet many boys in the course of the plot â which for some reason are not prohibited to appear in girlsâ rooms without attendant. The owner of the school and their headmistress, Madame Dubonnet, who, despite her age and respectable social status, is Miss, is strict only superficially. In fact, it turns out that she does not keep a finger on the pulse of affairs of her students, and they here and there do affairs right under her nose. The culmination of such behavior is provocative ball where solid half of females adopt the love revelations of the boys., , Season everything that happens with aristocratic voices of many actors, add here four characters of rich and noble origin, a drop of pride, a bit of charm of British traditions, as well as a lot of humor. And, like olives on pizza, sprinkle on top of it with pink crumbs of laughter, puberty, timid kisses, colorful costumes and good mood â and you get a complete picture of this musical. It survived around 3,000 shows in the world precisely because of its brightness and high spirits that it gives."
"58","Boy From Oz","    Todd McKenney was one of the actors who occasionally played the role that we tightly associate with Hugh Jackman in this musical. It was his big break, we can say, a benefit. Despite the fact that now, after a so much time, and many of his roles, it is difficult to associate Hugh with anyone else, except with The Wolverine, (well, maybe a little bit with the evil pirate from the new Peter Pan of the year of 2015), we still can see his past theatrical character. Brilliant personality who had an unhappy marriage with Broadway star Liza Minnelli, because of his propensity for man-love orientation. At least in something, he and his wife had common points of view â they both loved men., , Beginning with the Broadway and ending with places where Hugh Jackman was born â Australia â and even Peru, this musical has not visited the West End, but it is unlikely that it would be warmly welcomed there. At the very least, an Australian tan of Hugh would be too irritating for the prudish British., , The show tells the story of first husband of star Liza Minnelli, who eventually divorced him because of his views on inter-gender relations. They eventually made two bright careers, when they were apart, rather than when they were together. She grew from an unknown second-class canary into the mega-star, which now many admire of. In the plot, the viewer finds out what changes have occurred in their lives â the death of the mother of Liza, star Judy Garland, who saw Peter and made him the star of the scene â just like this musical in real life made Hugh a very famous person far beyond his continent; development of their careers, relations rising and falling and, eventually, incurable AIDS decease., , It is possible to love the acting of Hugh or not. To consider him empty actor, or to marvel the ease and simplicity with which Hugh displays his character. But if we are talking about the burlesque of the product created on stage, which he gives us, it is not necessary to question â it is splendid!"
"59","Boys From Syracuse","    This musical, we can say, is a remake of remake. It was based on Shakespeare's The Comedy of Errors. And this, in turn, is based on The Menaechmi by Plautus. The essence of the musical is as old as the world â someone confused with another and out of that arises the whole mass of absurd, funny, comic scenes, up to the point when the main characters are taken for the insane. The essence is simple, but the implementation is very interesting. The plot: two pairs of identical genetic twins, who were by fate and by the sea storm separated many years back and lived in different cities, until, by chance, one of the couple appeared in the same city. Immediately after the appearance, they begin to be in the same places and see the same people as the couple living in this very same city. Ridiculous situations and, in general, sitcom is the storyline. From this come all tricks that are aimed at publicâs entertainment from watching the comedy, and sometimes the situation is full of absurdity. However, this is not a theater of the absurd but the hilarious musical, which has a good music, vivid but slightly grotesque costumes, and lots of emotions. , , This show does not catch the stars in the sky, but tells a stout story that can be played for countless times. In particular, situation comedies have captivated not only the TV screens, but also often used on large screens as entertaining twists of the plot. What is attractive about the genre in general and particularly in this musical â sitcoms do not require a strong core of the storyline and it is enough only to be slightly indicated. Like here â a merchant from another city goes to prison, and will be executed, unless if during the day gives to authorities a ransom for own illegal activities in the amount of 1000 gold. Thatâs it, the end of core. And on this rod put, as parts of synthetic Christmas Tree, sections of branches & needles of the main part of the stageâs time and space. Like following: someone will think you're crazy if you donât remember the events of an hour ago. Or your wife will think that you are unfaithful, since you refuse to accept her as your wife. And so it takes about a couple of hours during both acts and you laugh. Actually, it means that this musical has fulfilled its main purpose. , , Bright costumes, with the prevailing blue and white colors, as if they came from the era of the Great Depression, when the entertain clubs of New York worn them, showing the restraint and elegance at once. Among the music, there are also a few bright songs, for example, ""Sing for Your Supper"", which is rightly proud of. And even, perhaps, to include this musical in a list of your favorites, for its ingenious simplicity and the absence of profound impressiveness, which is inherent in staging after Shakespeare, for example, on large screens (watch a film ""Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead"" with Tim Roth in the title role, as an example of how boring can film adaptation of Shakespeare be â its box office was even below USD 1 million). "
"60","Bridges of Madison County","    Firstly, a very non-trivial storyline is worth noting, which is good not only for the musical, but most of all â for the film on the big screen. Secondly, the excellent voices of Kelly O'Hara and Steven Pasquale. Second as if a professional singer, not an actor of musicals â so good he possesses his voice. He is like a nightingale in the woods â does all available trills, not missing a single octave and a single note available. This actor, apparently, one of the most talented actors of musicals that we have ever had a chance to hear in recent years. , , The storyline is as follows. A certain woman named Francesca is very much mired in the swamp of everyday life. The beginning is reminiscent of the plot of the musical named Baker's Wife, which was released about 40 years earlier, in 1976. However, such stories are often â we all know what happens when a woman begins to have a lot of free time, with husband always busy at work, when she is bored and meets a handsome young man who also feels sympathy for her. That's right, it all ends up with the bed, and after this are several options. She makes the broken heart either to herself or to her husband, after having a strong emotional choice: to leave her family and to run away with her new lover, or to stay with husband and to devote herself to the care and further prosperity of the family, taking care of children. Life is multifaceted, and therefore always possible to observe a great variety of decisions. For example, in the Baker's Wife, she ran away for a while to hers new favorite, but still returned to her husband. There is also a return to husband, but with the big difference â she had never left her husband and so he did not even know about her affair until his death. Let him so â he died in blissful ignorance, this is better for him. Especially when Francesca reflected on her past years, she realizes that this affair was only bright spot in her life. But the fact that she never went from family was a huge plus, because the family was all the time full, husband loved her, and never offended her in any way. Well, what about the neighbor's wife, who knew?  It turned okay. She supported her because, most likely, she also wanted such a bright event in own life. , , Musical raises the question before us, which is quite familiar to most â what to do when your life is boring. Someone decides that question having an affair. Someone drowns the time in the bottle. And some are close to hard drugs. In any case, every life is individual and it should not be taken only as ""What a scoundrel! (S)He is cheating on me!"". In fact, many seek for just an escape from boredom and banal divergence of views. Maybe someone just wants elementary friendship! We tend to think of this matter in this way. "
"61","Brigadoon ","    Friedrich GerstÃ¤cker was a German writer, who wrote a novel a couple of centuries ago that was the basis of this performance. It dealt with the mystical village carrying the intricate name Germelshausen, which may be translated roughly as ""Initial City"", which fell under the spell forcing it to disappear and reappear, protecting it from the outside world, as if conserving it from Chronos. Writer Jay Lerner denied, in fact, that he based his story on this one, because in the process of studying the material, in search of inspiration, he often ran on the folklore of the disappearing towns (they may also be called as âpaper townsâ â towns that are not exist really, but are a brainchild of their creators, mostly to protect the copywrite of their maps (you should watch the âPaper Townsâ movie of 2014)). Very different nations of the world had these fairies. Therefore, such a coincidence was unintentional, he said., , Bridge of Doon â this is the original name of the settlement, which exists in reality in Scotland, which gave the name to this musical. âDoonâ may be translated from Tagalog language as ""there"", but there hardly real connections are between Filipino and Scottish languages. The second possible naming is ""doom"", but it would be too gloomy in the real life, although would perfectly fit the name of an enchanted city that appears in this musical. Bridge of Doom â gloomy, but in the musical everything happens pretty fun and uplifted, despite the fact that even one murder happens in the course of the plot. But, as it turns out, it happens for the good, as the main condition for the existence of the city in the world â none of its residents must ever leave the city. One of the townspeople violates this unshakable vow, and he turns dead by falling from a cliff. However, for some reason, his murder immediately being classified as an accident and no police investigation carried out. The police has no place in this story that makes this musical to be a little fairy tale, like those done by Disney., , Very beautiful costumes, even luxurious, it should be recognized. Besides the fact that the musical was on the Broadway stage, even the film was made, where the costumes were also very good, with aspen waists of local girls. The film is more like a fairy tale than a play in the theater, but that's the beauty of all the films â they give more magic than a scene can give us (with very few exceptions)."
"62","Bright Lights, Big City ","    The musical tells a completely flat story of young man who comes to the big city from the province, but is unable to abstain from all those temptations that lurk here. Yielding to them, he destroys his life â work, relationships with friends, family and even causing a threat to his health, starting starve for a serious psychotropic substances, falling into the dependence., , Perhaps the creators of this musical wanted to show the young man as a kind of unrecognized genius writer who strayed from the true path and is mired in the abyss, instead of writing his first novel, which necessarily (though unknown why) must become a bestseller immediately after the release. But the audience â at least from our point of view, as spectators of this from the stage â thought he was a narcissistic egotist, who is full of self-pity, often engaged in soul-searching, and gives very little of time to what is really important â his goals. For example, he arrived in New York to write a novel. But it has left barely started â either his work prevents doing the book or the gatherings at the club. Do you know how many regular clubbers succeeded? The answer is too obvious. And do you know how many of them curses cruel world, who gave them no opportunities so they could succeed? All. Anyone who is not familiar with the concept of perseverance, commitment to goals and their achievements, despite the external circumstances â will always find themselves poor & miserable. Their lives will end after 15 years on the job like ""assistant of clerk"", where they are overgrown with beard and belly. Here, however, such a grim outline is not given, because closer to the end, our young man, antihero (because it is truly hard to call him a hero) acquires some clarity of mind and returns to his novel, overcame the narcotic intoxication., , The most striking parts of the musical in aesthetics and staging are moments when the characters portrayed in aimless existence in the club â they were all the time trying to seduce each other, to buy illegal substances, and to commit related ridiculous actions. The scenery with these is the most beautiful and soul-filled. The actors seemed to come alive when playing these numbers â perhaps the topic of clubbing is closer to them that anything else in the musical."
"63","Bring In 'Da Noise, Bring In 'Da Funk ","    In this musical, there are 27 short scenes, which should cause a sensation of pity, indignation, anger, and few more similar emotions in relation to the Afro American population and the time when the slave trade was commonplace, together with the attendant ""charms"" â lynching, beatings, horrifying violations of human rights and freedoms. Did you know that not so long ago, in 1955 (a year when the movement for the abolition of racial segregation originated by young then-priest Martin Luther King, who was killed for his views in 1968), white bus drivers could with impunity to shoot Afro American, if he refused to give a seat to a white passenger? And throw his body on the side of the road, while a white man calmly sat down on the place of just killed, and continued on his way with the bus, rejoicing a wonderful day and feeling the sun shines brightlyâ¦, , Not such mayhem hard, but very clearly this musical shows unlawful segregation and police brutality as well. For example, in one scene, where a young man comes to another city for permanent residence in search of a stable and properly paid job, in one of the evening goes to relax in the nite life. But stumbles upon some local revolt, taking no part in it, but, despite this, experience the police brutally and beaten-up to death., , Or scenes at the beginning and at the end (reprise), where young people cannot catch a taxi because taxi drivers confused by their skin color â a vivid example of racism. One of them even passing cars showing his gold bankcard, until understands the failure and futility of his venture. They all swear and show gestures of the fingers, which mean undisguised resentment from the fact that it is impossible to catch the cab. All this is accompanied by tap dance and folk music., , Some scenes are not very deep and just have lots of music, reflecting the essence of the name of this musical â synchronous movement and self-expression in everything. Every performance is different with lots of improvisation in both music and dance. By the way, all the actors that are involved here were developers, authors of music, libretto and choreography of this piece. The exception is only a couple of people who are illuminators, costume designers or make-up artists. Thus, the overall composition of creators and actors is about a dozen people, which is quite unusual for a Broadwayâs production format."
"64","Bring It On ","    This musical is simple, cheerful and very buoyant, youthful and carefree bright.  Internet has a number of different reviews of this musical, and they all use so abstruse words, that it seems that the reviews were written by some monstrous alloy of Kafka and philosopher-theorist in the fifth generation, whose usual pastime is to practice the syntax loquacious, where each word is replaced by its rare synonym. Who is interested in such? Only critic who writes this. From such too-smart reviews of cheerful and happy musical, it is wanted to say: ""Okay, youâve expressed your thought. And now letâs hear something on human language and rejoice the musical, not boring vocabulary linguist, which has been called to do a review of this musical due to some mistake. And anyway, you're of wrong century â is not fashionable now to know a lot of boring words""., , There is much dynamism in the plot and a story. Everything revolves around the little twists and turns of life of few cheerleaders, the backbone of which is the sudden transferring of one of the main characters, Campbell, to another school, where there is even no cheerleading group (in different versions of musical, this group may be or may be not). In the course of the story, we learn that it is the machinations of one of the school officials, who did not like the main character was too friendly with her daughter. Actually, this same daughter was dating a guy whom Campbell liked. So, it is not a love affair of young students as the rot of the plot, but fight for the dream. After all, the whole point is that the main character very much wants to become the head of cheerleaders, to win the Nationals, but the audience wouldnât have been interesting to watch her, how she does it through hard work and perseverance, gradually approaching the goal. The public never liked people's success stories, considering them boring, where the mainstream is a hard work and the ability to go right through everything to their goal, come what may. Do you know why? Because all the people in their overwhelming mass are lazy and mediocre and they crazily hate when someone is their complete opposite â hardworking person who achieves dreams. And this hatred is strong even from afar â everyone hates successful, envy them and vilify them. And imagine what would happen if they would have this goal-directed person in their team? Yes, all would proceed to get rid of him with a huge aspire, because he represents a colossal competition, which is easier to destroy physically than to fight it. Because the fight against purposeful person ends with losing, in any case. Therefore purposeful ones create their own companies and make millions, while others spit with bile, denigrating them â it's much easier than to improve themselves. Here are some of these feelings in question about the motives of the protagonistâs transfer to another school â the physical elimination, namely., , In the end everything, of course, turns happily, and the Good triumphs. In addition, the musical teaches us of ability to find a way out of different situations, of friendship and of team support. And also allows you to relax for two hours."
"65","Brooklyn ","    What is really interesting â not even something that lies within the musical. It is a story that stands behind its creation. That's the interesting thing â a pun in the history of the musical, which is more interesting than the main + the same thing in a musical â the story within the story, more interesting than the cover. In fact, it is not clear why to use such a technique as a story inside of the story, if you develop only one of them. In this case, the first story is just some kind of wrapper, which is not a pity to throw away. But first things first., , Firstly, the history of the musical is such. Once upon a time, there were two people who once worked together and wrote music. Since then, 20 years have passed and their lives were spread very far. One of them now â the homeless singer with a bum lifestyle that stands at some street corner of Brooklyn and sells his voice for pittance alms. The second is a woman who deals with her family. They meet at this corner by chance and get to know each other. She invites him to return to his hometown and to live with her, and in return they will work together to create something new. It took them five years to give birth to this musical., , Secondly, there are two plots inside of the musical story. First â how on the same corner somewhere in Brooklyn under the bridge lives a group of homeless singers. The second story begins when these homeless do the staging, which tells about a certain teen singer who comes to New York and climbs to the crest of the wave of success thanks to her vocal data. A fairytale in its purest form. Not burdened with details., , The naked eye can see parallels between the life of one of the founders of the musical and those characters that we meet in the story. However, the development gets only the story about the singer. The first story â about homeless people â as if dissolved in air, when everything passed into the second presentation. That is, we know how the story told will end, but do not understand why the shell fell into static. Actually, why do we, as the audience, had to know about some homeless people? Creators could just start right away with a beautiful fairy tale and musical format would be completely different, sublime, beautiful, more discerning and much more spectacular. And everything would be pink and blossomy., , The main character in the same name as the Brooklyn. Her mother, who hanged herself â was named Faith, in the wake of lifeâs despair, when she lost her faith, unable to overcome the difficulties. In general, the puns are continuing., , The musical has interesting outfits. A couple of them are made of restrictive yellow tape, enrolled on the body of one of the actresses and cemented for safety with a sticky tape. Even something like a hat made to match â from the same tape. It is, rather, not a dress, but a social parody. And the object of such parodies let everyone invents himself â there are plenty seeds were given to reflect. Why we do not like the musical, despite the presence of unexpected in extravaganza costumes in it, bright & piercing voices of some of main performers, as well as general not dull entourage? Probably, because the events in it are developed by the strict order and it is felt. Clearly planned and rehearsed events occur with heroes, in which guessed either farce, or incredible, fantastic naivetÃ©. For example, when a girl discovers an excellent voice and the next moment she becomes a star, just in few seconds. Yes, of course, we know such a thing as cutting, but this is the inability of actors to convey it. And because of this the audience feels cheated â it sees a stupid, fragmentary story."
"66","Bullets Over Broadway ","    The musical with the original idea and not a very good implementation. It is strange that such a number of awards were given to it, in spite of only 150+ performances on Broadway. Perhaps influenced by the aura of classic Woody Allen, who has done a very good movie 20 years ago. Therefore, a strong half of awards can easily move to him, as a tribute to his talent that made such a plain story to become a masterpiece, but not to this implementation., , Yes, of course, everything is based on many factors, as opposed to some that has only plot or only libretto as a strong part of the line â this may be found in other musicals, worked out only from one side. For example, there is a impudent sexuality of an actress who portrays overly erotic Olive. And it goes a contrast â she is incredibly stupid in everything that concerns the talents that should be inherent in the actors. We are saying now about this character â Olive, not about an actress who portrayed her. Latter has it all what it requires. And she uses to the fullest to display the sad sack on stage â the over-play, having no right colors, full of profanity. Or, for example, take a look at such a hero as the author of the musical inside of this musical. He was 24 years old, somewhere talented, but most of all â ambitious and persistent. And these two factors combined allowed him to receive funding for the project. But with the script, dialogues and generally all that concerns the filling of this project â he has a gaping hole instead of a juicy-full result. All the actors of his brainchild are on the verge of giving up to play in this because ""he writes the way people donât talk in real life"". It may be perfectly fair comment, if applicable to display the life of mediocre people. At the same time there are up to 5% of those who actually smarter; they are rarely possess enough simple qualities such as a desire to unfold in front of others (with their talent or inner world) to make something funny & easy. The author of this future musical belongs to those 5% and wrote pathetic things, detached from the realities of everyday life. So he takes advises of a gifted mobster who controls the production. He is the generator of interesting ideas that enhance the musical, but still it remains at the level of farce, as evidenced by the final song where they sing about the bananas., , In general, the development of over 2.5 hours is a pretty ordinary musical â does what it has to and delivers humor, songs, choreography and costumes. Its creators originally had no intention to continue it for more than 1 or 2 seasons, so such a small number of shows not much surprising â it possesses the previously planned artificial limit. Too bad that it was really hard to distinguish where the actorsâ talent ends, which we see on stage and where begins the mediocrity of depicted characters. The film was made with the brightest talent of Woody Allen, who has collected a whole heap of awards for his work. Fulfilling the same filigree play here failed. However, this histrionics can decorate your evening. But it is not something memorable for years."
"67","Burn The Floor ","    You wanted to visit the musical, instead you found yourself inside of a whirlwind dance! As if the best dancers from around the world gathered in this hall, at this stage, to show you the classical and modern dances, only some of which are ballroom dancing. Here we meet Latin, samba, rumba, flamenco, tango, swing, cha-cha-cha, and many others genres in the hall for a few hours. It's just a theurgical magic of dance, where emotions and tensions between partners have stepped on a new height. Where almost every move is delicious, clear, precise and passionate. Where the story is told in glances, gestures, passion. Where costumes and movements are beautiful and filigree. Where the bodies of dancers are beautiful, desirable and flexible. Where the audience wildly applauds the way the participants play â smoothly and magically â when performing their dance steps., , If you are a professional in the world of dance, you know all the rhythms, forms and movements that are inherent to a particular dance, then, visiting this musical, you get an incomparable pleasure from the dance extravaganza unfolding before your eyes. If you are a novice in the world of professional dance, like us, then you're just wonât have enough your breath watching the filigree movements of the elegance of dance, you will fall in the complete delight from the seductive bodies of all without exception members of this musical and will see how many electricity in their movements. They dance as if it affects their lives and the dance decides whether theyâll live or die. As if they dance for the last time in the life. Or even before the Last Judge in Purgatory, who will decide, following the result of their show â is it enough for eternal suffering in Hell, among the crowd of legless men, or it is good to Heaven of dancers where they are will be surrounded by the best representatives of their profession for the exchange of experience and the endless ecstasy of dancing., , Musical is nonstandard in having no plot. The second distinguishing feature â it goes on the stage, which can be viewed from three sides. Since the ensemble is large, about 40 people can be on stage and hiding such a great cast just behind the faÃ§ade with 1 side would be wrong. So Longacre Theatre on Broadway was selected, where the configuration of the scene captures the whole beauty with a viewing angle of approximately 270 degrees., , The show is not specifically created for Broadway. Rather, Broadway and West End were only a step on the path of its life, albeit one of the most striking. The entire show attended more than 130 countries and 30 of them have been upfront Broadway. There it stayed only for two seasons, which is associated with the financial failure in ticket sales after two main dancers left a in a few months after the start of it, who happened to experience the disagreements on personal matters., , Despite this, Maksim Chmerkovskiy â one of the departed leaders â returned some weeks later. But the show did not show a significant breakthrough and it was decided to continue the show in other places, including national tours. In our opinion, this musical is one of the most remarkable in those emotions that stay with the audience after watching it and which you want to see over and over."
"68","Busker Alley ","    This musical is not bright, but it has a long story. Initially, at the beginning of the last century, the German writer on social issues Heinrich Mann had an idea that emerged in the novel in 1905 (when he was 34 years old). This writer was born in the European German city, remarkable LÃ¼beck, which is famous for its magnificent architecture, Gothic cathedrals and incredibly beautiful, as if personifying a postcard with pretty well-kept and clean German houses. In 1933, the writer was forced to flee to USA, fearing for his life when the Nazi came to power., , After a story, as a result of promoting of it by the writer, who could now create freely, 5 years after arrival in the US, the screens saw the film with Vivien Leigh, whom the world knows as Scarlett O'Hara from Gone With The Wind. By the way, this film was 1 year after Busker Alley and completely eclipsed it with its meaning. It is a pity that this actress died of tuberculosis at 53 years old, and in 2015 her childless daughter Suzanne Farrington passed away, also an actress, interrupting their ilk., , The film was not known, forgotten until 1960, when it was accidentally discovered in the archives and it was decided to stage a musical. 1969 was the first attempt to revive it that did not work â no one was interested in it. 13 years later, a second attempt with the same unfortunate result took place and yet 12 years later â the third try, this time successful. Each time the story was rewritten and adjusted to the realities of the current time, so from the book of 1905, only a little remained â just an idea and concept, because all content has changed as much as 4 times. The musical never reached to Broadway, stopping with a broken leg of the main actor, in connection with which the producers decided to halt it. Then, from 1994 to 2006 it had variable (but often â bad) results on different stages, but could not stand nowhere for more than a couple of months of running. When it included the stars of the musical Barnum, it gained some popularity, but still was at the level of ""musical for 1 season""., , This musical has a bright influence of cockney â British creators Sherman brothers, who made in their careers things like music to Mary Poppins and My Fair Lady. Besides the fact that Mary Poppins is an independent musical on Broadway, Mary Poppins rather attract much more attention than one considered here. It is not that it is bad, but it had a plot clearly below the average, which can be considered as a set of clichÃ©s and there is nothing literally interesting, for which you can catch on in terms of it. No twists of the plot, no outstanding songs or bright literature of libretto or lyrics. Stage design, sound and light, as well as the costumes â all this is pretty mediocre."
"69","By Jeeves ","    1996 is a year of presentation of a musical. The prefix Â«ByÂ» in the name of the musical has been added so that it was not associated with anything more â not film, stories about the resourceful butler, not with any show that uses this character. People are strange â in the show they sit and laugh, going out they say that the musical is weak and un-researched. How do we know about one another? Very simply â the musical lasted only 38 plays, which indicates a negative reaction. But in the hall all laugh at jokes and generally are in a good mood â this is clearly evident from the video files that are attached here on the website in the ""Video"" section., , Lloyd Webber has created a pretty good music. It is always different, for which he gained loud popularity. But everything elseâ¦ how to put it softer. In the style of British humor from high society. In general, the average American will not understand about 80% of those jokes., , The musical tells the story about a young man from high society, who spends his time rather nonchalantly. All work instead carries by and all rough edges are smoothed by his servant â a shrewd and intelligent man who ate a dog in the lifestyle and customs. He gets his master out of many situations, such as the simultaneous flirting with three young ladies, who were ready to learn about each other, but that did not happen, thanks to his gifted valet. You know, every nation has its heroes who are wise and deal with different situations. In Turkmenistan, for example, it is Yarty-gulok (Tom Thumb). Russians have Ivan. Ukrainians have a resourceful Svyryd Opanasovych. Their number is bigger than you think. For example, the film ""The Pink Panther"" also shows the hero â not very smart, but deciding a certain range of problems through humor and laxity. Such large and small heroes are hundreds if not thousands. Jeeves was one of them â with a sly squint, elegant and knowing when to say strong language, and when to show own well train to cater all others, first of all, his master., , This musical visited Broadway, which had been reworked several times, rewritten and supplemented, because its creators could not accept its first failure and the musical had more potential than it was able to show at first. Good comedy, greatly reduced in time from simply impermissible giant 4:45, during which some viewers might banally want to visit the toilet, because they could not wait to the end of the play. Several nominations for the Olivier Award and a Theatre World Award, along with other no less spectacular awards and nominations, which are now input in the arsenal of this musical, are indicators of the quality, comparing with the first release."
"70","Bye Bye Birdie ","    For a start, it is worth noting some ""advertising"" names of the main characters and the places where the events are held. Kim MacAfee, Gloria Rasputin, Sweet Apple. First â Antivirus (MacAfee). The second â a brand of strong 40-degree drink made of rectified spirit (Rasputin). The name of the town in which the events occur â is as advertising of Apple. And even with the prefix âSweetâ. Funny and scary at the same time, how many previously familiar ordinary things are now associated with trademarks., , Second, the main character, because of which all the fuss in the musical â almost a total copy of Elvis Presley, who originally was worked-through not very deep. By the way, alike musical already exists in the world of show business â when a celebrity comes to the godforsaken town and makes its life as a great confusion and turmoil, which then calms down. Best Foot Forward â that's its name. Between them, all things are different, except of the concept. There is a famous diva singer who agrees to accept the jokily invitation of the local high school student, who invited her to his graduation prom. Here is no invitation â  a star (Conrad Birdie) arrives in a small town, deciding to give one little local girl a kiss during his last concert, the last before going into the army, as well as Elvis did in 1957., , While he comes to town, it triggers a series of events â a local girl of 15 years (in the original musical), whom he should kiss, throws her boyfriend, after he kicks in the face this rock-and-roll star. Then he inciting a local company of young people, staggers, to go to a local bar, where he quickly found by the police and was arrested, and the parents took their teens back to homes., , Rock-and-roll stands at the first place in the musical. This show is another incarnation of Elvis, which is so much liked that about him regularly movies are shot, shows & musicals are done, his songs are still on the radio. This is not to mention the competitions, which are held like ""who better imitates Elvis"". Elvis has become himself an entire industry (black Elvis, Santa Elvis, dwarf Elvis and so on), and this musical is an echo of his popularity, which has come at least until 2010, when this was last time it staged., , A lot of bright colors displayed, in addition to the songs in a style that is so familiar to us of all. There still such timeless themes as teenage disobedience to their parents, parting with the girl (then making peace and boringly living in a small town with no hope of a bright future) and, of course, dancing. Dancing is bright as the youth can be, full of passion and luxury spray with colorful paints that make the sky bluer especially when you're young. The point of this story that unfolds on stage is not to show the plot, although it is here too and quite entangled, but to immerse the viewer in the atmosphere of the late 50s, the golden age of US."
"71","Cabaret ","    Strong musical that deserves each of its awards, which it received â among them there are all theater awards both from the USA, and from Britain. You should understand â itâs not just many of them, it is MANY. Almost every musical evocation provided it a reward, or at least, nominations. Reason of musicalâs power is in its plot, which always has a strong effect on people's minds. Subject associated with Nazism is alive as long, as least, 100 years after the last person born in the 1950s will die, who forced to live in Europe in the period of post-war chaos and crisis. In addition to the main theme, which is the entourage of the musical, there are also those strong and eternal themes like inter-gender relations, abortion, unplanned pregnancy, job loss, blissful ignorance of circumstances that make your everyday life even gloomier in the hell of war, first of all, civil. Here, once again denounced prejudice against a person only because he is not of the same nationality like yours., , A strong play, which in one of its resurrections was directed by Sam Mendes â the person who shoot the âAmerican Beautyâ â his debut film after the theater who brought him an Oscar, allowing entering the list of five directors, who received Oscars for their debut film work. He brilliantly revealed in the theater and in general is a man who strongly reflects the nuances making them particularly colorful, for which the audience loves him., , The musical reveals events that took place in Europe of 1930s, where pre-war tragedy develops as a background. But the main events â the personal dramas â are strong series to which the viewer cannot remain indifferent. The protagonist is a writer who comes to Berlin, pretty quickly disappointed in this place and goes to write his new novel in yet relatively quiet Paris, while all who are left behind will experience a very unenviable fate of war hardships., "
"72","Calamity Jane ","    Calamity Jane is a local celebrity in North America, which fought for the rights of Indians (the indigenous population of the USA), was frontierswoman and generally very harsh person who became known as the army scout and explorer. She was familiar with Wild Bill Hickok, who was then and still remains a legend of the Old West â he was a shooter and a gambler. It is because of him the name of poker cards combination called Dead Man's Hand â this he handled during the death., , In the musical, Calamity shown as a peace officer (the modern equivalent of police ranger), which acts on a par with Wild Bill Hickock, protecting the city from evils and misconducting. Wild Bill became famous for his legendary ability to shoot accurately and invention of dueling on pistols (revolvers) â when two people are facing each other and fire at a signal â a scene that is often portrayed in the Westerns., , The film, which was released after the musical, was very handsome and good. The song that the maid singer performs, who was confused in the plot with a big show-business star, even received an Oscar for the best song of the soundtrack of the motion picture., , The musical does not take anything from real events that happened to this strong-willed and tough woman. It is based solely and completely on fictional situations in which the only true fact that she was tough, and wayward. Without displaying her civil attitude towards scumbacks, as well as Native Americans, on the side of whom she was â and it was at odds with the position of the then authorities., , The musical includes new 6 songs that were not in the film of 1953. It is an adaptation of earlier productions, which took the format of the show. Also, one of the songs that sounds here was written for the film, but it was not included., , Breaks between sets are up to 43 years, but without taking this circumstance into account, the musical is performed frequently when performed. Since 1994, it went almost continuously until 2015, at least for 9 different years, that may not be considered as real interruptions., , This musical is generally quite funny, filled with Wild West, with all its clichÃ©s, as we know in it: a holster on the belt, leather pants, a plurality of pieces of clothing that are hanging here and there (sewn leather strips) etc."
"73","Call Me Madam ","    This musical is interesting especially because of the bright costumes. In the film, they were more convincing than on the stage. But if on the stage the actors would dress as flamboyant as on screen, it is unlikely that the budget of the musical would have paid off. Because only one article of costs for costumes would be unaffordable and heavy, exceeding somewhere USD 0.1 million. With a total gross income of USD 4 million, it would be tangible expenses., , Title âCall Me Madamâ has originated from one huge desire of a socialite to be called so. And so that the others called her so too. This person was appointed to the role of the official ambassador of the USA in the fictional European country of Lichtenburg, where the form of government is the principality. This lady truly existed in the real life, which was granted for her services by the then President Nixon with position of ambassador in Luxembourg. She was a fundraiser and socialite lady, very advanced in terms of politics. , , Europe, which has undergone numerous changes in all its stormy and rich history, have gone through many bad leaders in government, but this person appears in this musical as highly pertinent and able to deal a huge loan for her needs (for the sake of country). For example, it is a social parody of the fact that the United States love to lend money to different countries, when the latter are in need. So now, in the course of fundraising, the luxurious party was organized, during which she comes to the President of the United States (who was there too). This lady agrees with him a considerable loan of USD 100 million. This allows them not only to solve the internal problems of the state (which are invented, because in real life both Luxembourg and Liechtenstein do not undergo with financial difficulties), but also to inform future political allies â the neighboring country â that a local princess is okay with dowry."
"74","Camelot ","    In spite of the classic story, it is something to criticize it for. For example, Merlin. He is represented to us at the very beginning of the musical as an assistant of King Arthur. But then, in just some fussy minutes, he is on the stage among the actors and all of his destiny is cut off with the fact that he gives in to some water nymph to stay forever sleeping in her slippery, wet and cold cave. Ugh. Merlin, the magic power of whom had almost no equal! However, let us assume that the nymph somehow won him. But why is this character must be represented to the viewer at the first place? To immediately withdraw him out of the game? What is the purpose fulfilled? Answer: no purpose., , Next, we come to the fact that in the story there is a whole bunch of knights, of which we even know three or four names. But did somebody had the general care of the working-out of the characters of these knights? Among all of them, who are not King Arthur, we only know Lancelot, which is the main antagonist of our hero. By the way, Arthur generally presented here as a sort of âtry-and-buyâ version of himself. Among all his obvious achievements that multiply in centuries as well as in the stories of his greatness and enormous prosperity of England under his wise leadership, in a musical his main achievement is presented as only the creation of the Round Table. That unites under its wings all the noblest knights. One thing is unclear. Where England at once took so many noble knights? Until such time, as the Round Table not existed, they were slobs and only dealt with twisting tails of each other in tournaments. And suddenly â only 5 years have passed and â countless hordes of them, as the selection of nobles and super-loyal to the King. For what? Because he just made some circle of interests, called it a Round Table, gave it a noble motto, attached lofty motives and thatâs it? Okay, so it can start. But would somebody explain to us, for whatever reason anyone has to die for the king, just because being a member of the social institution? In reality, of course, legends are more beautiful and more complete from a logical point of view, but this isnât revealed in the musical. And Lancelot himself from the legend has become a lover boy of the king's wife."
"75","Can-Can ","    It plunges you into the atmosphere of Paris of 1890, where glamor and glitter of gambling houses, saloons and brothels tightly adjacent to poverty, dirty streets and ragamuffins. Nevertheless, we shall see only the first part of this â the beauty. Can-Can was then terribly scandalous dance and some say that if was invented by quite un-sober fallen women who get on stage without underwear to demonstrate all her charms under her skirt to increase the flow of new customers to herself. But rumors are rumors. Over time, it has become an art, and quite fascinating one. And not lost its charm because of the exciting and enthusiastic dancers whose underwear attributes become a part of the dance. It now could be beautiful, fitting up tight or not, there can be garters or stockings on the legs â many variations that make a dance attractive, full of choreography and requires, moreover, to be very well in fitness. After a few minutes of high lift up of legs to the music, and beautiful too, you tired a lot. And if we are talking about dance, rapidly gaining popularity, â that it had to be danced for hours â it will be better than any workout at the sports club., , Musical simply marched triumphantly through the world of Broadway in 1951 and now this dance is loved and performed in many places. It consistently attracts customers at any theater or cabaret or a film. Well, in 1890 it was banned and too outspoken, what to say â lovers of strawberry sat for whole days in such cabarets to watch the forbidden fruit., , Echoes of the main promoter of this dance, French Toulouse-Lautrec, found its reflection even in modern musicals â Moulin Rouge with Nicole Kidman and Evan McGregor, for example, played by charming devil John Leguizamo, who is quite versatile actor. There Toulouse inspired the creation of a brilliant new musical, which breathed new life into the Moulin Rouge â that time cabaret / brothel of the third class, which suffered a decline, and made this place fantastically successful, with the result that it has become a symbol of France and Parisian gem., , The plot revolves not only around dance, but also around love and the viewer gets one of the many answers to the question â which is higher â love or principles? In particular, we investigate the question of morality. It turns out that the feeling of love is still higher than the sense of principle. It is widely common theme, which is used almost everywhere. One often weights is love in its various cover versions (falling in love, passion, desire of intercourse, the desire to reproduce with a strong male or a nice female, hot love, crazy love, etc.). And on the second side is a variety of essential counterweights (moral principles (as in this musical), prohibition or breaking the law (film Romeo and Juliet), the structure of society (film Divergent), the company's activities (film The Island, of 2005), the success of the grand event (Moulin Rouge again) or many other examples)."
"76","Candide ","    It is difficult to write a review about such a musical, which visited so many countries and places, changing from terrible to average and to the fantastically phenomenal. If we consider its first staging in 1956, it is worth noting that they were disastrous â two acts of continuous sitcom and incoherence of the libretto and the musical mood that would be passed to it by creators â the atmosphere of charm of the 18th century, when the high society reigned passion for mega pompous hairstyles and outfits. If we talk about the most famous its resurrections â a few years after a disastrous beginning, it is this ascension from the dead should raise praises because it really made musical very successful. And on both sides of the ocean, it was acted a total of more than 1000 times just in two years after the second start. Then there were many of resurrection â the mere listing of years of the show would take a few lines., , This format is not even a musical. It is operetta, which lasted for two years in the Opera of New York. During its many variations, the makers have experimented with many options for the staging. There was even one where the scene was a multi-tiered, and instead of changing the scenery between scenes and acts, the viewer simply refocused on another part of the scene in which events unfolded. This was done as a result of fourth staging of operetta and the then recognized by critics as a very successful step., , In the story, the main character, after whom the play is named, experience the collapse of his personal views on life as he passes through the horrors of war, class hatred, fall to the bottom, prostitution, and many other troubles. He grew up like a capricious plant, which did not tolerate any heat or cold, and has always been in concern, wrapped behind the bonnets, fences and walls from the outside world. And now, when he was plunged into all the horrors of the world, he realizes that everything he knew up to that time is lies and nonsense., , Many critics did not like the original libretto of 1956, which made the operetta an unstageable monster, although the music itself was favorable. And even after the successful processing by Harold Prince, this opinion about the play had lived long still. However, between the first and second productions, it has changed so much that we can say that the play has become a truly original., , In 1988, after the huge amount of reworks, revisions and additions by a great host of creative people of all kinds, musical finally gained the most final version, which was performed by Bernstein â two years before his death., , However, that did not stop the play to develop further â and already in 1997 and to this day, this operetta undergoes multiple changes before each staging. In addition to constant changes associated with the book, a set of songs and choreography, so also every actor adds something own to this sitcom, which is now more like a farce than a theatrical performance."
"77","Cannibal ","    Trey Parker's pre-South Park work. And even before he released another musical called the Book of Mormon â funny, desperately feeble-minded about half-wit heroes, one of whom is half and the second is wit. Everything that Trey Parker handles, turns deadly satirical, with piles of corpses, killing of innocent (bastards, they killed Kenny!). There is no Kenny here, but in the appearance of the characters already prototypes of the heroes of the South Park cartoon are guessed, which is so clearly and desperately loved by all of us., , It is interesting to watch as one of the half-naked protagonists at some point sings full of love and tenderness lyrical song with a double connotation When I Was On Top Of You â about his horse, as it turns out later, â for which he longs. It is one of the least funny moments of the musical, which tells not only about the fact that someone loves his horse with unnatural (albeit platonic) love. It is about a satire on society in general. The farer less cynical style than universe of South Park has. But it is too exquisitely farcical, full of exaggerations and absurdities that embrace those everyday little things that we hide in our lives. For example, love of one of the actors to the cannibalism is ridiculous, exaggerated, and just a tomfoolery. Or as the whole city is dancing in anticipation of a quick execution of the offender. In public, we are humble, theatrically lowering our eyes when we go among the crowd to watch the death by hanging, but in the hearts we feel rejoice that soon we see blood and death. We will feel more alive from this. And we are glad that this is not we who are hanged. Why do you think videos about all sorts of car accidents are so popular on YouTube? Why do people enthusiastically watch slashers in the cinema, where folks are killed by many ways? Because all are thirsty for blood, death and suffering â and that is what the creators of this musical give to everybody. Be happy and enjoy your bloodlust!"
"78","Carnival ","    This musical is an example for many young actors; it is possible to train well on it. It is known, but not often dragged onto stage. Probably because it is difficult to find on the role of the protagonist the same bright personality as the original singer and actress Anna Maria Alberghetti, which has wonderful, superb operatic voice. Nevertheless, Victoria Thornsbury coped with the task and enriched her role, bringing to it a new vision, while remaining a naive girl who is trying to find her place in a gamy carnival (or simply, in a traveling circus), where so many different people had gathered under its dome. There she was an object for molesting, harassing, she was accepted to work and fired from it, she was like a bone in the throat to someone and someone confessed his love for her, and she felt happy with someone. The motivation of the protagonist is unclear and it is the same unrevealed from where she came into the circus. In the story, she is a naive orphan, but it is unclear what are here motives, they are not disclosed. Why would she want to be coupled with this itinerant circus? She admires them? Good. She was imbued with enormous sympathy for anyone in the circus? Also not bad. But whether she had sufficient motivation to strive to devote all her time to this circus only, and stay with it for a lifetime? Does she understand what a wandering life means? When you are almost constantly on the road and carry all your belongings with you. All the moments of real life that always accompany such a life style and their complete, indeed, bleak existence, are not represented, of course, in this musical. Instead, the viewer sees only the most successful and bright moments. For example, when the show in which she participates, becomes a hit (as this musical that won the hearts of fans and critics from the very first show)., , In general, very elevated acting and dedication of actors should be noted. Their characters were bright and juicy. The main hero that depicts the orphan has not only voice, but also the charisma. Like everyone else in this show, she very advantageously played her role. For example, Gus Curry (who plays Paul â a man who is in love with Lili, and with whom they eventually stay together) has very strong baritone voice, which he favorably and successfully used in the course of this play. D. R. Sullivan was very humorous Marco, who has his eye on the main character. S. L. Jones played delicious assistant of the magician, which envy to Lili., , Adding to the already talented show even more puppets, who are spoken by a voice of 1 person, and his voice sounds for 4 different dolls with their vocal hues, it results in following â you just cannot resist the charm of this play!"
"79","Caroline, or Change ","    Musical reworked several times to be not so... cold, if we may call it like that. It had some difficulties, which it was able to overcome during the off-Broadway exhibition. For example, the complete alienation from the public, which it had previously, now had been replaced by inclusion, when the existence of the public wasnât recalled just along the way. Once the actors got used to their roles more organic after all its previews in the Broadwayâs scale, they ceased to be so alienated. Yes, we understand that the topics raised in this musical, are quite serious, but their giving to the hearts of the public through the prism of full attention on self-consciousness is not the best option. , , George C. Wolfe gave to this musical the ability to convey to the audience the old themes in new ways, through small representative pieces. When the economic downturn and the confrontation between the races, which is still there in abundance, from a large scale all over the country, shrink to the size of a single family (in our context â two families) and displayed through an employer-employee relationship. Exploiter and exploited. Who is paid only $30 per week for the dirty work in difficult and even dangerous conditions. Who cannot even buy Christmas presents for her children or to take them to the dentist because she physically does not have enough money. , , After the main character, Caroline, arguing with a boy of her employer, due to the particular application of the educational process of this little fellow, she generally becomes endangered in losing even that unpretentious work that she has. She reflects on her role as a small cog in a big machine of capitalism, cursing fate and frustratingly aware that her eternal destiny is to be at the laundry service for breadcrumbs. She will remain the one who cannot afford even good, tasty and hot Christmas meal for her family, not to mention for herself. , , A musical about the confrontation of the two worlds & worldviews (everything happens on the background of the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Vietnam War, segregation, abolition, young Martin Luther King and so on), and also large perturbations in the society. And all this only results in the fact that small people remain small because they have no opportunities to study, and there is only a tough day-by-day work, necessity to feed, which cannot be treated casually, because it provides them unsightly existence. We see this musical in this way: although slavery was abolished, it still has its real manifestations in the form of servile work everywhere. "
"80","Carousel ","    From the original production, the past ones, at least the ones that were set during the 1992â2008, are distinguished by the presence of information about growing of one of the main characters â Billy. It is told how he raised up and became a greeter at the local fair (Carousel). It is mentioned that he was a sullen boy who was closed from inside. He had accomplished nothing in his life, because he is of that breed of sluggards who aspire to nothing. Especially to nothing good. And who can provide his family with money only under the lash of his wife shouted at him, and as a result of acute feeling of kick in the buttocks, and after the view of shaggy ragged wife and hungry children. Overall, an unpleasant person. Reeling with his friends, paying more attention to them than to the family, having no job, is engaged in alcohol and fast life, and goes on a crime (robbery), as an attempt to provide earnings for his family, because he couldnât cannot find an honest-paid work. Renegade of the society, if in a few words. , , The world at the end of the pre-previous century was quite severe. For example, a girl decided to take a nice time at the fair, to flirt with somebody, but her behavior has become an object of gossips, police was summoned, and she got fired. Simply horribly. Imagine yourself â you went for a walk in the evening, or a ride on the carousel, or go to the movie â and then bam â and you're fired, your employer and the police wanted to escort you home, so you sat there and did not protrude. Madness? You bet! But in the 1890s, for some reason, this was considered normal. , , Meanwhile, the main events of the play are two most important factors that are universally timeless. First is domestic violence. Billie cannot enjoy the feeling of being a full-fledged man, because he doesnât work, his life is not worth anything, and he is sloven and a drunkard. And therefore, havenât succeeded on the Maslowâs pyramid (located at the very bottom of it), he assures himself at the expense of the weak â beating his wife, which is also pregnant. A typical example of a man who cannot create, but only destroys, splashing out his anger on those who are close. Small homunculus and, in short, a complete bastard. Second is a crime and the penalty incurred. The same age-old theme of the fact that any of our choices lead to some consequences. For example, the choice to go on the offense â to rob a rich man of the village. Which instead points at you with a powerful shotgun, and you know that now you will feel very bad. Because at the laws of self-defense people that time looked through very tightly-clenched fingers considering the killing of a thief a good thing. What to say, if until 1960 black population was not considered for people by whites. So what to say about the thief, who had come to you with a knife?! Attempt of murder and robbery â in such circumstances a death on the spot was the logical conclusion of catching him. Nobody would have thought to judge you for what you did to protect your property and yourself. They would just pat you on the shoulder and say: ""Well done!"", while the robberâs dead body would serve as food for crows on your empty space on the back yard, as a warning to others. , , In short, the immersion in 1890s turned out very vivid and believable. "
"81","Catch Me If You Can ","    You can criticize a musical, which was done on the stage as like to complement story already told to us from a big screen in 2002 by Steven Spielberg. Film has collected USD 352 million in the box office â exactly USD 300 M more than was spent on its production. The plot of the film was written by the main character â Frank Abagnale, a real person that existed in this world and who became famous thanks to the movie. The brilliant criminal who is the same brilliant as Richard Branson in his genius of the business. They both started their path in the school â the genius is evident from a young age. Their similarity probably ends with the realm of this musical. , , So what it should be criticized for, you ask? For dim display of its characters or bright, glitter and glamour songs of actors as if taken out of context of the libretto? Or for the fact that the main pillars of the musical are only bright girls and super miniskirts, which border of voluptuous obscenity was overstepped 5 centimeters ago? And, perhaps, for the fact that you do not believe half of the main heroes in the way they display their characters? Choose for yourself â this cocktail of minuses is quite extensive., , On the other hand, there are many issues for which it is worth praising. For example, the Tony award was given to Norbert Leo Butz for displaying FBI agent on Broadway, who chased Frank Abagnale. All the other actors that played in a variety of musical performances before and after him, clearly donât have the talent of Mr. Butz. Or, you can praise the play because it does not introduce anything fundamentally new that would not be present in the film. Controversial pro, but it is thanks to this, the audience gets exact story line of spectacle as in the motion picture and is not disappointed after watching musical. Or, if you think, there are more advantages that flow from one of the cons â gorgeous actresses, apotheosized short skirts and actresses bright appearance let you receive little more than mere aesthetic pleasure of discovering the art, but also the pleasure of seeing tight charms and elastic roundness during musical. And, of course, the main character himself simply delicious and this plus is able to drown out all the other blurry cons. He is young, charismatic, charming, able to radiate energy with certainty, and Leo Dicaprio is constantly guessed in him, who worked in the movie just fine. Have we already said that in real life Frank was below 21 when became a millionaire? No? Ooh, pity. So, we'll say it now â just imagine how madly talented he was after received such a brain allowing him to be a criminal genius! Here many parallels can be done with another crime genius â Gatsby, who is â is it a coincidence? â was depicted by same Leo in the famous motion picture."
"82","Catered Affair","    You can try to accept this show as a kind of social revelation, when it opens up the problems of the family, in which such light event is coming like a wedding. It goes against the background of exaggerated desire of mother to please hers daughter, arranging luxurious wedding. This desire suddenly woke up to her as compensation for the lack of attention to her kid when she was instead engaged in eternal work on household chores. Here we also have admixture of father's business, who wants to expand his share and seeks for money to do so., , John Bucchino, who wrote the libretto for the play, made it closer in style to the tragedy, bringing maximum realism in dialogues. This musical even less musical than you expect from the average musical. The songs in it are not an addition of the ordinary events of daily life, but as if torn away from the dialogues. Perhaps the creators should feel more music in their approach or not to create a musical at all, making it a conventional operetta or a play without music, just as a classic play., , Actually, judging from the essence of the story, it is unclear what interest should be brought for the ordinary viewer with this mundane chain of events from the life of an ordinary small family in Bronx. The bottom line of all that is happening you can literally pass with following sentence: ""The daughter decided to get married; initially she wanted a small wedding, then big, then again a little, and I bought a bigger share in my business."" After all, those are quite ordinary things. This is like making a musical describing that someone had dinner, watched football, and then went to bed. Or how 7,548,645,021st child in the world was born. Routine, beaten track., , But, perhaps, this musical has some sort of its own, special, morality? Maybe it carries some weight of its own idea that was originated in a small society and is important for everyone? If so, we have not found anything like it though tried hard."
"83","Cats ","    Cats have won several Olivier Awards for all time (in addition to already mentioned Tony, Drama Desk and Grammy), making an absolute world record for the number of shows â more than 17 000 (appending together the West End & Broadway & other performances). , , Its success is phenomenal. It was filmed in 1998, based on the musical, adapted for those who never saw it in theaters. Also, the show has been translated into 20 languages. It has one of the highest citation indexes among musicals. Better known than this show is only The Phantom Of The Opera, which is now the longest in the history of Broadway and still running, started in 1988, having now 11600+ productions (the number grows because the show is active)., , Cats possesses lots of unusual things. First of all, clothes and make-up that makes all the participants of the musical look similar to real cats as much as possible without special effects and without harming the musicality and not hindering the movements. Secondly, the scene is made in the form of a huge landfill, where events unfold and all cats... sorry, the actors play their roles, using things from the stage â that is, from the trash. Third â there are no dialogues between the songs, that is, only the songs, so there is no libretto in the classical understanding. Then â there is no general line of the plot but the idea of some cat that night should ascend into some semblance of cat paradise, to be reborn there and to return to the mortal earth as new and young kitty. The show consists of many small scenes, where every cat presents himself or herself, own position in the hierarchy of the cat world and a character. And, if possible, an occupation., , The show differs with phenomenally bright voices that sing songs of very different genres, from pop to jazz and beyond, with very clean notes. Therefore, all the actors are almost operatic singers in conjunction with good dancers. Its success is enormous due to the fact that its general spirit is light and nostalgic, memorable as Christmas and holds in mind very long after viewing it. I personally met this musical as a child, watching the broadcast of its video-version in 1998 and it felt as if I was watching a musical on stage. Spellbound looking at all of these actors and their masterful performance of songs, watching their flexible movements of bodies and had been filling with sense of good and plausible tale, unfolding in front of my eyes. And this is still the most ""delicious"" musical, which originated love for theater arts in my heart, letting me feel the magic that is unfolding before the eyes of the stage., , The musical has become so popular that it even plays regularly on some passenger ship during the cruises. There are so many places it has visited with performances, that they are more than can the average person can afford to visit in a lifetime. Also thanks to it, records are produced. For example, 700 people have played on stage simultaneously in Australia, under the auspices of Harvest Rain Theatre Company, in 2014. Or on its 25th anniversary in 2013 it was a giant choir of 3,500 children in Europe, which, thanks to computer technologies, merged & could play in the biggest musical composition altogether., , This musical is the inspiration for several generations; it has been developed over 4 years before its start and its great fame would not subside even many decades later."
"84","Chaplin ","    This musical has one nomination for Tony & 6 nominations for Drama Desk Award. None of these awards was given to a musical, because during its show there were stronger plays on Broadway. For example, it is a pity that this musical was destined to play in the same time as the Lion King or The Phantom Of The Opera â it just pales and fades out on their background, like many others, not as talented as those two mentioned. However, such is the fate of all the productions for 1 â 2 seasons. Here, in particular, show stretched only 1 season and that was it. , , Among the many things that have been created for the sake of describing the life of Charlie Chaplin (books, movies, shows), this musical was something washed-out, too corny, focusing on human compassion more than on other emotions. In general, it looks like not very plausible tale, which is made in a style that is difficult to describe at once. Rather, this style is the story of a legendary person that has not yet become epic, but which already has too little from this man whose life had become a fairy tale â the penultimate step on the way to become epic in the future. We liked much more the film adaptation with Robert Downey, Jr. (this is a fellow who depicts Iron Man recently), which was sad but filled with much more emotions than the powdered with sugar, on the brink of a foul being close to cloying farce., , The main problem of this musical is that it tries to cover as much as possible from life of Charlie, giving priority to narrative, that is, chronological description of events. The creators of the musical forget that the presentation of the material is more important than time track, when talking of musical format. It should have been, perhaps, focused on some particular significant event or a bright sequence of several chronological events, with an emphasis at artistry. For this reason, many of the films failed to transmit the fun when contained so much historic information that it become boring. For example, the film named J. Edgar with Leo DiCaprio (directed by Clint Eastwood) â although it paid off at the box office, it was boring and tedious, where only a few bright moments were interesting. Here there are also some moments when it becomes not boring, but then again the viewer is immersed in sugary routine of what is happening on stage and could even reach for own mobile phone to pass the time or to leave the hall."
"85","Charlie and Algernon ","    Charlie is the name of the main character, who suffers from dementia from the birth, resulting in an extreme lack of socialization and less basic skills. He does not even have the instinct of procreation. After some surgical interventions in his brain by local doctor, Charlie begins to acquire intelligence rapidly, becoming almost a genius, but after reaching at a certain stage to the maximum, he again begins to degrade and is transformed into the same undeveloped man he was before this operation., , This plot was originally developed as a short story in 1969 by writer Daniel Keyes. It is now unlikely to be determined, due to the death of the author in 2014, but the story could well be based on the novel ""The Heart Of A Dog"" by Mikhail Bulgakov. The latter wrote it in 1925 but it was published by famous publishing houses only in 1968 both in London and in Frankfurt. That is, a year before this story saw the world. Parallels between them are quite obvious, of which the most important is the transformation of a certain person in more intelligent due to the operation, and after â a regression to the previous stage. However, the other parallels are not so brisk, and the characters are different also, as well as their stages of development, but the main idea is quite could be encouraged by this novel., , The role of Charlie's pretty simple, but dual. First, he needs to portray convincingly the mentally underdeveloped personality, due to DNA abnormalities, and then to depict his development, which is very believably reflects his rapid gaining of mind., , In the course of the musical, as in other works â short stories, novels, movies, radio shows â also raised social issues like these: public attitude towards intellectually inferior individuals, the boundaries of love, hardness of social adaptation and soft drugs (nicotine, spirits). During the play on stage, however, the viewer not only watches certain issues, but is glad that nothing the same mentally bad happened with him or her & that (s)he is pretty developed person. Therefore, there is a barrier of pity between the protagonist and the auditorium that the spectators have for this character., , All major actors, except Michael Crawford, could not as thin show all facets of this character, as described in the book. The film of the last century with the actors, some of whom have already deceased, also havenât win great popularity due to not transmitting the atmosphere and mental vibrations of the protagonist, who was disappointed by the cruel human world. And it's even better to be back degraded for him â in terms of a simple person â so not to accept the brutality of his environment, even if he had to give up the love. Not to say that he has sacrificed it, because he had no other choices., , In itself, the production can be called difficult, because in the book it is easier to describe the fictional world of the hero than to recreate it on stage without the risk to get involved into the center of an ethical scandal against the disadvantageous description of mentally disabled people."
"86","Charlie and the Chocolate Factory ","    London â The song arrives late in the new musical âCharlie and the Chocolate Factory,â but when that familiar lilting melody begins, audiences come alive as at no other point in the show. During one performance this summer, several people hummed softly while others smiled broadly as the mysterious chocolatier, Willy Wonka, stepped into his glass elevator and sang âPure Imagination,â the immensely tuneful number from the 1971 film âWilly Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.â, , The showâs director, Sam Mendes, feared this would happen. He resisted including âPure Imaginationâ at first, saying he already felt âhauntedâ by the performance of Gene Wilder as Wonka from the movie. He didnât want his musicalâs otherwise original score to be sized up against the most beloved song from the movie., , But now it is âPure Imaginationâ â more durable than an Everlasting Gobstopper â that is haunting the $20 million musical. The show may well end up being remembered as a cautionary tale for movie studios who want to make musicals out of films and books (in this case, by Roald Dahl) that are treasured by many., , âItâs a song you canât get out of your head,â said an audience member, David Reid of Inverness, Scotland, as he and his 12-year-old son, Matthew, stood outside the Drury Lane Theater after the show. âItâs quite hard to improve on that movie, isnât it?â, , âCharlie,â the latest theatrical effort by Hollywood studios to cash in on movie properties, is facing an uphill climb toward a major goal of its producers at Warner Brothers: becoming a hit on Broadway. The world premiere opened here to sharply mixed reviews this summer, including some harsh ones â a hindrance to any future Broadway transfer, let alone eventual profitability here or in New York or from road and international productions that might follow., , More damning than anything, some critics declared that the most resonant song in the musical was not one of the 18 original numbers by the Tony Award winners Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman (âHairsprayâ), but âPure Imagination,â the only tune imported from the Wilder movie., , While Mr. Mendesâs musical has much else that is new â a plot twist involving Wonka, played by the Tony winner Douglas Hodge (âLa Cage aux Follesâ), for instance, and an updating of Charlie and the other four children with golden tickets â the show nevertheless finds itself struggling to compete with a ghost., , âI found it pretty difficult to un-remember Gene Wilder while I was working on this, but ideally people have to put aside the movie,â said Mr. Mendes, himself the Oscar-winning film director of âAmerican Beauty,â and whose last picture was the James Bond blockbuster âSkyfall.â, , âLook, we have seen visual renditions of worlds on film that you are never going to get in theater â the yellow brick road will only go to the back wall of the theater, and Wonkaâs river of chocolate can never be matched onstage,â Mr. Mendes added. âYou have to find magical solutions to theatrical challenges, and hope that the audiences are open to them.â, , No one is hoping more than the showâs lead producers from Warner Brothers, Mark Kaufman and Raymond Wu, who took over the theatrical division in 2011 as part of a shake-up after its Broadway musical flops âBaby Itâs Youâ and âLestat.â The two men were bullish during a recent interview, using their own superlatives to describe the London production of âCharlie,â but they also said that the musical would be retooled for Broadway., , A New York transfer has not been announced; while the 2014-15 theater season is thought to be the target, the two men declined to say when it would happen. (Another musical based on a Dahl book, âMatilda,â is now running in London and on Broadway; it has had strong reviews and solid ticket sales in both markets. The âCharlieâ producers said they were confident that âMatildaâ would not swamp them.), , âEvery show and everyone deserves a second chance,â Mr. Kaufman said. âPlenty of shows get reviews that arenât favorable the first time out. Our word of mouth is good, and weâre playing at 95 percent capacity, which is a very good sign.â, , Several Broadway producers who have come here to see âCharlieâ were lukewarm about its script and score and said they would not want to invest in any Broadway transfer of the show. (The producers would only disclose their reservations anonymously, for fear of offending the artists involved.) None had any easy solutions to the showâs flaws, but posited two ideas. Lacking excellent reviews, the show needs to build into a box office sensation to justify a transfer to New York. And the producers could add more popular tunes from the Wilder film, like âThe Candy Man,â or the âOompa Loompaâ songs that accompany the little orange-skinned men who work in the factory., , But the Warner Brothers executives, who have heard these suggestions, wonât go there., , âWe want the musical to be a companion piece to the other âChocolate Factoryâ properties, not a souvenir, so using more songs from the first movie is not part of our plan,â Mr. Kaufman said. âAn American audience might be a little different from here, so we might change things to suit that audience. But Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman did their assignment really well, and I think people will notice that.â, , Mr. Shaiman and Mr. Wittman were clear from the start with Warner Brothers and Mr. Mendes that they were not interested in a mÃ©lange musical, combining their songs with the Oscar-nominated score from 1971 by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley., , Mr. Shaiman, who wrote the new music and collaborated with Mr. Wittman on the lyrics, said that he was not sentimental about the movie â he didnât see it until he was an adult â and felt âno pressure to live up to it,â because a 2005 film adaptation of the Dahl book, starring Johnny Depp as Wonka, showed that a new version of âCharlieâ could be commercially successful. That movie was not a musical, however, inviting fewer comparisons to the Wilder film., , For their âCharlie,â Mr. Shaiman and Mr. Wittman, who are American, chose to develop a score rooted in the exuberant patter and innuendo of the British music hall tradition. Each of the children, meanwhile, has a signature sound, like techno rave music for Mike Teavee and rap for Violet Beauregarde., , âAnd with Wonka, he is part Ray Davies from the Kinks and part NoÃ«l Coward song-and-dance man,â Mr. Wittman said. âDahl is so British and Sam is so British, and thatâs what we went for â and we had Dahlâs great wordplay and idioms to work with,â evident in their comic song âStrike That! Reverse Itâ that opens Act II., , As for the addition of âPure Imaginationâ to the score, the major players on âCharlieâ have different recollections of how it came to be included., , Mr. Mendes said he came around because of the loveliness of the song, but didnât think it would be creatively helpful to force it on his songwriters as they were developing their score. His producing partner, Caro Newling, said the Warner Brothers executives wanted a fresh score, but also wanted âthe powerâ of âPure Imaginationâ in the mix. Everyone resisted at first, she said, adding that Mr. Shaiman was the last to embrace it., ,  âSam took Marc and Scott away â I think for a weekend to his country place â took them for a long muddy walk,â she recalled. âScott was much more able to go to the place where he could see it. And the truth of the matter is, it doesnât impact on the show adversely. There are some great numbers in here. âSimply Second Natureâ is a beautiful song., , âSo thereâs always a nervousness. But actually, I think Marc probably will never get over it, is the truth of it. He will always choose to see that as the song that they could have written better. Now Iâm putting words into his mouth.â, , Mr. Shaiman said that, in fact, he and Mr. Wittman came to realize that âPure Imaginationâ would be a good fit for the show; it is now sung near the end when Wonka and Charlie fly in the factoryâs glass elevator. (In the movie, Wonka sings it as he and the children enter his chocolate room.), , âCaro and Sam might have taken a motherly, fatherly point of view about âwhat will the boys feel about this?â â Mr. Shaiman said. âFor years we would tell people that we were writing this score, and very smart people would say: â âPure Imaginationâ! I love that song!â Scott and I are not stupid. To be blunt, we wanted to make a hit. We wanted to please the audience.â, , The libretto, by the playwright David Greig (âThe Eventsâ), has plenty of echoes of the Dahl book and the first film, but there is less of the sardonic and idiosyncratic humor. Mr. Greig, too, did not grow up with the original movie, seeing it only when he signed on to the musical project. He said he wrote the show strictly with children in mind., , âItâs for the kid in the audience who has read the book but doesnât go the theater much, and this is his first show â so I want the story to absorb him and transport him,â Mr. Greig said. âEvery story and every new show needs time to breathe and find its proper state, and I know weâll do more work on the production. At the same time, weâd be foolish to rush in and make changes just to react to reviews.â, , For now the most pressure is on Mr. Hodge, who has received generally good notices as Wonka. He passed up a high-profile British revival of âBarnumâ to do a new musical, and was taken with the inventive language and the challenge of playing an enigma. He thought about Charlie Chaplin and Michael Jackson as he mulled the affect and tone of the elusive man-child Wonka, and he, too, tried to block out Wilder., , âIâve done mainly Shakespeare, and you canât get caught up in thinking about the great actors who have done hefty interpretations before,â Mr. Hodge said. âWhen youâre in front of a 2,500-seat theater full of children, thereâs a specific energy required for a Wonka to be the motor of a stage musical. There had to a point where I said, âThis has to be absolutely mine.â And Sam was always urging me, âDonât be afraid of the darkness in the character,â which I also think is particular to this musical.â , , As rehearsals began this spring, Mr. Mendes said, the memory of Mr. Wilder began to fade as Mr. Hodgeâs characterization grew sharper. Mr. Mendes said he now feels âfreedâ from the original movie in a way that he audiences in London and, eventually, New York will feel too., , âDoug is my Wonka now,â he said in no uncertain terms., , And that Wonka, as Mr. Wilder did four decades ago, is still singing âPure Imagination.â"
"87","Chess in Concert [LIVE] ","    Production in the West End is characterized by its vitality and entertained the British public for 3 years. After moving to Broadway, it was closed after only 60+ displays. Rolling Stone described the show as an unusually fresh look at the old things. Record of music from the show was holding on the first and on higher positions in mostly industrial developed countries, where people love not only good arrangements, but also excellent rock, which is abundantly present in this musical. Critics acknowledge that the perfection of execution is in the first place, primarily affects the listener., , Sweden was the only country where a record stayed on the charts at the first position for whole 7 weeks., , The musical resulted in mixed assessments of the critics, from the very laudable to completely horrible. For example, one of them was such: the musical is too long, empty and it had an unbelievable story that disguises itself as a solid musical., , This work is a derivative of the original staging of the musical named Chess. It changed its format â the audience is now witnesses some of the scenes, the most important ones of the two acts, which were represented in the original musical. This time it is also a musical, but it was a live show recording, so a show was reduced for about an hour till the 2+ hours instead of 3:15 for this format. The biggest accolades singing to musical were for acting of the main three heroes, whom admired everyone, and there have been no complaints about the way they give what they should give. Broadway redesigned compared to what it was in the West End and now the story tells of the world chess champion â Anatoly Sergievsky, a resident of the USSR, and Freddie Trumper was his main rival and contender for the title, not vice versa, as in the USA version."
"88","Chess ","    Critics did not like this musical at all, despite the fact that its creator called it as good as anything he has done before that time. What the critics specifically did not like: the characters, where everyone behaves like a madmen, shouting at each other to the accompaniment of rock music. Some critics said that the show was full of not witty songs and speeches, where none of the love stories were touching the heartâs strings. Yet they noted that the show loiter the audience with numbers that stick out their personal significance., , In contrast to such nasty reviews, there were also the opposition to them from people with bigger IQ, who did not failed to understand that this show is rather complicated, that it is necessary to delve into, and not just to watch idly. That it does have its quite emotional tension, you cannot just go and sit on your seats having in mind: ""I have come, entertain me"". It is profound and requires the viewer to possess the intelligence and a particular focus on the story. Few are willing to say that visit the theater exactly for this, and not merely at a secular party, to see their friends. This opinion was held at that time by a few people that were employees of Time and Providence Journal., , There were also such reviews, which said that the cold and nasty in many aspects confrontation between the USA and USSR is far gone, so now this musical is not relevant anymore. While it depicts Bangkok too colorful, as a contrast to the first world â gray â of USSR, and to no longer gray, but industrial cold and black world of USA. In general, despite other reviews, very controversial, even within themselves (a great musical, which is burdened with unnecessary time and 3+ hours of unsuccessful libretto), all the critics agree that the main trio of leading actors are excellent and worthy of all praises. Judy Kuhn in general should be proud of such praise as ""the main pleasure of the show"". One critic noted that honestly do not know why people havenât liked the show, but he knows for sure that the audience was emotionally involved in this & definitely liked it."
"89","Chicago ","    The musical is based on a play of 1924, written by a reporter M. Dallas. It exalts the romanticism of the criminal environment, where the big criminals were big stars in the real life, and the most striking events have been associated with the world of crime. Suppose now with less emphasis on the criminal component, but with more accentuation on vivid stage images and choreography, as well as on a strong storyline, the musical conquers the world with its march. It has not only beautiful dresses and elegant men (remember the image of Richard Gere from the motion picture of 2002), but also a very beautiful woman, who, of course, is a huge part of its popularity. At least among the male audience., , It contains a plot about the fate of the two striking women who have committed murders and now serve a sentence while awaiting trial in their cases. They get acquainted with the charming lawyer who pulls them out of jail, bringing an acquittal. For his work, he takes a lot of money in those days â USD 5,000, but it's worth it, as he is a professional of the highest quality, always wins the cases., , The fact that all the events in the musical are based on real events happened in 1924 also adds paints. The prototype for the beauties-killers were acquitted women whose stories were in the press of those years, and columnist woman that lit them, was sympathizing with these women, made a significant contribution to the promotion of their stories and the subsequent acquittals. The image of the lawyer was a collective picture from two different people who have defended these women, strangers in real life, opposed to the musicals and film. Stories in the press have been so successful that the journalist even wrote a musical a year after, and it came on the scene in 1925 and played over 176 shows that in 1925 was a great success. Then a silent movie was filmed, which remake happened in 20 years after (although there was really innocent woman accused in the second movie). After another 20 years, new creators decided to redo it and start a musical on Broadway. Buying the rights took 9 years, and after another 5, in 1975, musical came to Broadway. From this moment, it begins the victorious march at world capitals and it beats many records for the duration of the play., , The musical staged magnificently, with burlesque and brilliance in the style of vaudeville. In the screen adaptation of 2002, this technique was often used, which connects it with the style of the musical, of cinema, of storytelling, and of theatrical masterpiece. No wonder it has grossed a third of billion dollars. The musical, though not full of stars as on big screen, is still beautiful, elegant and even more professional, no offense to Richard Gere, which is not a dancer but an actor., , What is most vividly remembered after watching it but quite obvious burlesque happiness, is very clear display of all the ins and outs of falsification of large cases in courts, going out dry despite all, lies, and the world segmentation on the hard working class and the rich, which dominated then in society."
"90","Children's Letters to God ","    Some critics, cynics and awfully highbrow snobs, allow themselves to describe this sweet and childishly naive good musical with bunch of pompous words from which it is clear only that they perfectly know how to use synonyms vocabulary. It is difficult to understand what for to construct horrific verbal constructions from simple thoughts that use such turnovers that people never use in everyday life, because they are from the category of hollow phantasmagoric verbal tightrope-walking, the essence of which is zilch. Were you was able to read previous sentence and understand what it was about? Well if so, because it is only 50% the same dreary and unpleasant construction as one of the reviews that we have read about this musical. You know what people say â thanks to the Internet, many persons have learned the buzzwords and it became more difficult to determine the idiots. , , About musicals like this, people should speak as simple and easy as possible to understand their very essence, without grandiloquent syllables. Why we needed this digression at the beginning, you ask? Because this musical managed without flowery sentences to classify and to convey to the audience in a very simple, easy and understandable form subtle essence of our being. In particular, growing up, during which we ask a bunch of questions. ""Why the sky is blue? Why cannot we kill my nasty older sister? Why bees poop with honey?"" The truth is, most advanced kids ask themselves these questions earlier than at the age of 8â15 years, as on the scene here. These issues arise during the period of active education, between 3 and 7 years. But we also have exaggerated questions asked on stage; there are more of them here, more adult. In addition, there are also very serious things. On which adults often cannot answer unequivocally with details, so they have to arm themselves with a box of Martini and free a separate Saturday or Friday night. For example, why my parents have separated. Or why do thick I have to become thin, contrary to my nature? Just for the sake of public opinion? Pff., , What is interesting in the musical? Firstly, it is the stage design. All the backdrop was a large handwritten letters to God. The latter is not masked by anything, but represents only a certain general all-knowing force, which allows to ask questions and to find answers sometimes through the environment or the internal ""me"". A large sheet of paper of about 16*32 feet, on which some wishes were written, that these kids really wanted to come true., , Basically, the musical contains songs, which are bigger part than lyrics. Children cope with it all very well, at the level of adult actors who have graduated the drama college. The age of their prime five (or eight, if considering their substitutions) â just one that is not the best way amenable to training. Surely, the creators of the show have put many efforts to receive disciplined actors."
"91","Children Of Eden ","    This is similar to the musical The Apple Tree, in essence and presenting of information. The plot â the biblical Adam and Eve, passing all stages â from meeting, dating and giving names to animals, the birth of their children and exile. The important difference that The Apple Treeâs Adam was shown as a cynic and a narcissistic loner, but in this show, he is depicted as a naive young man in love. Above that, in the before-mentioned musical, all the action ends with the death of Eve and Adam is left alone, growing a garden planted by Eve. Therefore, the events in The Apple Tree savor their acquaintance, mutual affection and everything that happens to the exile. This one explains a lot more. Apart from what has been said, here is also a clutch of new people, whom Eve gives birth to, the fratricide, a big chronology of time before the events of Noah and the flood and the Ark and rescue on it, including family dismantling and reflection of the curse of the patriarchal line of Cain, whose all descendants have a special birth-mark on their skin., , The popularity of this musical is in its easy scalability in the number of actors and in the size of the scene, the same as in the prop, until its complete absence. Also â because of the opportunity to play it entirety or parts thereof, clarity of eternal truths, which it sets out â family values, murder, procreation, the knowledge and the loss of paradise and eager to find it, and hope that we are return there someday. Incidentally, the Garden of Eden has very likely engendered the concept of Heaven, where we return after death, finding the way to the lost Eden, that we had lost many, many generations ago. The concept of its search over time evolved into the whole religion (and even many of them), where the look for Eden in the earthly life is not a literal search (although there are some people that take this concept literally, so they plow the globe of the world in vain or productive quests â looking for paradise, who believes in what kind of it), but keeping the righteous way of life, and the result will be guaranteed journey to  the pleasant Afterlife, not in Hell., , Stephen Schwartz, director, conductor and founder, hands to many (if not all) professional productions of this musical. We can say that it has become a successful business of his life. He even drove it to Australia. In 2014, its one-time presentation took place in Kennedy Center, with following cast: J. Jordan, R. Bohmer, R. N. Jones, A. Brown & C. Brown."
"92","Chitty Chitty Bang Bang ","    This musical has a list of awards: Laurence Olivier Award â 3 nominations in 2002 and Tony Award â 5 nominations in 2005. Not a single victory, but this is probably the case that it is important not to win but to participate., , In Britain in 2006, it was renewed in the form of a tour on cities, where it stayed until 2007. In 2016, on Christmas, musical should be played in London. Musical drove to Australia that is fond of theatrical producers, in 2012, where it was in Capitol Theatre, Sydney., , Germany was the only country that hosted the performance among other countries, except of Britain, USA and Australia. And it was there in 2014., , This musical holds a rich history, as sometimes happens among musicals. Not often, only in about 5% of the cases, but still. Ian Fleming is British writer, a native of Scotland, which is known to the whole world by his stories about James Bond. Now, thanks to his cultural and historical heritage, film corporations collect a lot of money in the production of these films, every year or every 2 years. Did you know that Ian is one of the heirs and the grandson of the head of the financial and banking corporations whose core business was an asset management? He did not need the money during his life and could easily create. However, there was a time when he tried to do something in the same financial field under the pressure of his family, including a broker position, but did not succeed, because a different path was prepared for him. Goldeneye â was not only the name of one of his most successful novels, but above all, a mansion in which he wrote all his stories about the secret superspy called Bond. In turn, this name comes from one of the species of ducks, the males of which have dark plumage on the head and eyes yellow edging., , The musical is 2002 (as well as its counterpart later in 2005), was based on the book, inclusively based on the movie-musical of 1968, which came out grounded on the book. Its production engaged in the UK, but its rentals were in USA and Canada also. Box office from only USA & Canada was considered when estimating its rentals, so it very may be that with UK's box office it had indeed successfully paid-off. , , The original book was written by Ian for his little son to read at night, first in the form of short stories, as often happens, at least Winnie the Pooh may be remembered., , A whopping USD 15 million were spent on the show, and the bigger part of these investments could not pay off on a Broadway, according to one of the producers. Perhaps there was a return during a tour of the city, which was launched shortly after."
"93","Chorus Line","    According to producers, this musical had gross USD 277 million in the box office, and it was viewed by six and a half million people. The Public Theater, which shows a musical, receives profits for many years mostly from this musical, its professional and amateur productions., , It so happened that in 1991, four of the original creators died, three â from AIDS, while another â from cancer. The latter, fifth, died in 2012. It is a negative, but rather a true advertising of the fact that AIDS spreads highly among LGBT population of the planet, as a critical cause of the death in this group. Therefore, some may say that those who choose their orientation, should always understand that it is also a selection of great responsibility and attentiveness. However, any partners of both genders should always be approached with caution and carefully to the partnersâ selection, so to die in the warm bed from natural causes rather from than the consequences of AIDS., , Theatre, where the show opened at the beginning of the way, as pre-Broadway, was The Public Theater, which staged in 1975 & a theater took a loan in the amount of USD 1.6 million, to start this production. In the future its creators probably praised themselves more than once for such a wise decision, as this has become their gold mine. However, its 6.137 regular shows were organized in the Shubert Theatre., , Bob Avian and Michael Bennett were its co-creators and choreographers, has successfully made own musical child that lasted from 1975 to 1990, before the closure holding the record number of presentations on Broadway. Show subsequently arrived on the West End and had multiple plays in different countries (Canada, Mexico, Australia, Singapore, Finland, Argentina, Brazil, Sweden, Serbia, South Korea, Norway and others). Its production continued and renewed since then and the last professional production was relatively recently, in 2014. At the beginning of 2016, this musical is on the 6th position of the longest-running shows in Broadwayâs history, with the final figure of 6.137, while the Cats, The Phantom of the Opera, Les Miserables, The Lion King and Chicago only possess more., , People who visited all the major staging of the show â the first one in 1975, in 2006, and in 2013, noted that this histrionics is still as fresh as the first time. Of course, it is necessary to make a substantial amendment to the human tendency to idealize the past, and to have admiration along with enthusiastic feelings about returning to the place where they received good & beautiful emotions and spritz this all on top with chocolate crumb of the expectation of a miracle, which they have already seen and now want to experience the same again. Therefore, casting aside all this plaque, we can say that this show is a vivid example of the style that loves Liza Minnelli â colorful costumes, enthusiasm, excellent choreography and the overall atmosphere of the holiday, all the staging time. It is worth noting that there is also a strong emotional component, which has allowed the show to receive the Pulitzer back in 1976 â outstanding achievement for a musical. It also a fond by the representatives of LGBT community, since it is their manifesto and bright event in public life."
"94","Christmas Carol","    To be honest, it is difficult to understand why this classic story has been staged as a musical for the first time only in 1994. For example, even Muppet Christmas Carol was made in 1992 â when the national wealth of the literary creations by Charles Dickens were so much assimilated with the minds of people that no unoccupied niches left, except of A Muppet Show, which entertains us for decades. Its creator, by the way, Jim Henson, passed away in 1992 and this film was dedicated to his memory. That was not a musical, but also had a lot of songs, good dialogues, and it was one of the most prominent personifications of this classic story., , Because the basic story is short, it may contain many variations that add parts creating a new image every time. But always its essence lies in the fact that being an infinite miser â is not an option, nor even a form of acceptable existence., , By the way, not only that Scrooge has become the basis for beloved cartoon character Scrooge McDuck. Few people know that this story does not teach how to become a generous purchaser. First of all, it teaches of how good it is â being a philanthropist, and a full member of society when you realize that you can do much because of your wealth (change the world, make it better, to help truly needy people). When you realize you only become richer when giving back, along with the person to whom you give (such a cute paradox). Good, strong and genuine positive emotions â that's what this world has as one of its best values, and many people have already understood that. Being a philanthropist (and this is shown by the same Scrooge McDuck in the last cartoons) â it is more addictive action, stronger than any drug and physiological act of coitus, how great wouldnât it be., , Incidentally, many languages have derivatives from the word Scrooge in their vocabularies, which means approximately similar notion. Ukrainian, Slovenian, Polish, Czech â they all have the concept of a miser, poverty, including extreme poverty based on the phonetics of âScroogeâ word. Rooting of the derivative is more than a couple of hundred years, very solid. For example, even for a very long time one of the modern nominal names âgooglingâ will not be a full replacement of word âsearchingâ, while Scrooge rooted in Slavic languages with the same value long ago (for example, âscrootaâ â in one of these languages means ""extreme need""). This all suggests that Dickens was a great explorer and this man came up with Scrooge name not from the scratch. Just as the name of the well-known character Chewbacca was chosen by George Lucas, based on the Ukrainian word Â«sobakaÂ», which means ""dog""., , In this particular musical, we note, first of all, the costumes, which are almost authentic to the time, which is described by Dickens in his story. This play teaches us all, but especially children, of the importance of good and intelligent economy, but not so terrible meanness, as shown by Ebenezer Scrooge."
"95","Cinderella Songs from the Classic Fairy Tale ","    Doing this show, creators faced a hard work, which is usually vividly indicated when they want to emphasize the incredible involvement of all participants. For example, this technique uses Chris Columbus in his mega-hit Home Alone, which shows as in the morning the whole family was running around looking for their belongings. This musical was implemented about as tensely & less comical., , Musical staged on Broadway is a little different. It started with the second part, which goes after ""happily ever after..."" and includes a lot of what was not in previous versions. For example, Cinderella draws Princeâs attention to injustice happening in his kingdom. Such roles were introduced as the evil prime minister who has become in charge of the Kingdom after the death of a king, despite the existence of legitimate, blood prince. This minister does the approval of new laws that severely oppress justice and make him more powerful. Other new faces â a militant youth with a warm heart, a rebel Jean-Michel and his girlfriend, who decide to throw down the authorities, which are more criminal than fair. Several new songs were written for this version., , Describing the show of 1957, it must be said that this version has already become a classic, where everything is beautiful and the story is the same as we know it and remember from the childhood. Glorious dresses, pleasant people, good acting. Version of 2013 on Broadway was a completely new rethinking, staged in the Broadway Theatre, directed by Mark Brokaw, with such actors: L. Osnes, S. Fontana, V. Clark, H. Harris, P. Bartlett, A. Harada, M. Mindelle, G. Hildreth. As many as 9 Tony nominations for this fairy tale is a fairly good harvest, we believe. However, there was only one received for the costumes, but it is more than a sweet pill because, apart from the main theater award, musical experienced 5 nominations for Drama Desk, three of which turned out to be advantageous. However, critics of the show were quite contradictory. Some people did not like the idea that after ""happily ever after..."" turns out, may have a completely new story, also interesting (though once the movie Shrek has proved the existence of history after this ""point of no return"" and, it should be recognized, quite successfully). But no matter how critics tried spitting with snots on the show, it was a success and closed after 770 regular performances and 41 previews. US tour began in the autumn of 2015 and continued until May of 2016., , Returning to a more beautiful version of the 1957 (and probably the most beautiful among musicals about Cinderella), a huge number of people â 107 million, 60% of the US population, was watching it. One of the founders said of the success in this way: âcoming out at the streets of Manhattan short after the broadcasting, I found them almost completely empty because all stayed at home to watch this magnificent showâ., , The audience of musical was divided into all spectrum â from full amorousness to complete indignation. Critics both praised the play & completely rejected all, finding everything bad from music and stage design, to the libretto & costumes, including lightning and stage work., , It should also be noted that all versions of the tale, which we know now, are quite soft, as modern people do not understand the hard tales. Even now, the evil characters are often portrayed with soft hearts (remember Maleficent). In the original fairy tale, the evil stepsisters were chopping off own toes with an ax to wear a shoe, trying get into with own stumps (unsuccessfully, however). In addition, a ""good"" Cinderella ordered to execute her stepmother and step-sisters after her marriage to the Prince."
"96","City Of Angels ","    This musical possesses 6 Tony Awards and 5 nominations (incl. best musical, best actor & best libretto); 8 Drama Desk Awards & 4 nominations; 1 Edgar Allan Poe Award; Three Laurence Olivier Awards and seven nominations. It, however, had its biggest success on Broadway, where it lasted almost 900 performances., , In the West End, in spite of the many awards and nominations from there, it hadnât managed to gain the successful box office â it lasted there for 4 months only. Maybe the reason for that was a convoluted plot and sugary ending, which negates all the developments of a storyline along the plot. However, according to one version of the musical producers, on its failure in the West End has influenced not weak storyline, but economic downturn and falling of public interest in musicals, including a decrease in the proportion of wit minds of the audience in the total mass of spectators. Hey, producers, do you believe yourself in the articulated reasons? You have a bunch of awards for it and these reasons are too subtle, to be able to hide behind them. Plot, in which reality and fiction are intertwined, can seem so complicated that even the audience from West End has decided not to devote time watching it., , However, this is only one possible view of the reasons for its failure, because in USA it had good â about 900 hits â success that has given work to many people involved in its production for 3 years, from 1989 to 1992. Successful national tour only confirms this. Perhaps the reworking of the story that took place in 1992 has been ambiguous. Is it possible that because of it, the audience on the other side of the ocean turned out to be immune to the vicissitudes of the plot where reality and the inner world of a man intertwined with his illusions? This is one of detective stories, where the plot appeared flat and uninteresting, many things are not explained but served on a plate as obvious and inalienable. As if this was a movie where the plot worked out so badly that it had to be masked behind the acting., , Thanks to a very successful promotional campaign of its producers, the musicalâs tickets were sold at USD 18 thousand, and the total fees for the premiere were UDS 0.3 million. Although the opening day turned out not absolutely successful â the reviews were mixed. However, there were much more positive ones. Critics agreed that music, nice mixture of jazz and pop, very profitably emphasizes story and infects the viewer with a positive mood, as well as nourishes the line of narration with smooth transitions that allows this creation to be a soft mixture of comedy and detective where an invention is an integral part of real."
"97","Civil War","    2 Tonies nominations, 4 Drama Desk nominations in 1999 â here is the list of achievements of this musical, which it has as the most outstanding ones. Because it is unlikely to be repaid in the box office through its unbearable small quantity of shows â they were up to 100 on Broadway, considering both regular and preliminary. Its pre-Broadway history of ""running"" was also rather short and showed a sluggish willingness of the public to adopt it, rather than as a resounding success. This musical is probably playing on the patriotic feelings of the population more than is the actual musical, which can captivate the viewer. 65 regular shows clearly demonstrate this. Most of all, we believe that its creators went bankrupt in the costumes that were, though not lush, in a minimalist style, but they still had to be provided for as many as 28 people., , Musical yielded a lot of criticism because of lack of storyline, as well as the lack of emphasis on any particular character. Events in it were presented in the form of individual stories of people who were related only because were captivated by the Civil War, which broke out the USA. Undoubtedly, a very dramatic event in the history of the canvas, but this background has tremendously huge number of books, stories, short stories, novels, movies, cartoons etc. created â and their vast majority has a story. After all, this, whatever you say, is still the main component of the good narration. Without it, no matter how difficult or interesting story was, as the narration is a story about a series of events, any creation would be unsuccessful; a story mist have the beginning (a tie), development and culmination. On the other hand, many of the works were screened using the story very frivolously, treating it as something superfluous, to please the whim of the director or other creators. And because of that, included in the list of losers, like this musical. Being far at the bottom of the list of the most long-going, it seemed to visualize a vivid symbol of the postulate that the plot is 80% of the success. A strong plot is 99%, becoming a classic through the years. For example, the story of Noah and his Ark became a classic, thanks to strong story, albeit with some discrepancies and matters, but has long been on the pages of the Bible & then stepped into the life, and is now shot in many quite good cartoons and movies, collecting millions of money., , This musical, however, aside from the lack of such an important thing as a story, allows opening the best voices of its solo performers. For example, in the song Sarah & Honor Of Your Name, we hear two great, strong voices, of which a female is distinguished by soft tones, in contrast to the flashy but the annoying male sound."
"98","Class Act","    Critics have reacted very sensitive, giving their assessments of this musical. Yet, praising it, to some extent, they evaluated the life and work of their colleague, Edward Kleban, after whose life was this musical produced. It is unlikely that any of critics will do at least one bad review about this, when ""one hand washes another"" and ""raven crow will not peck another"". Why do we say so? Because each person, and critics especially, dreams of that there was musical following his life and work posthumously created, so everyone would love & appreciate him or her with all these enthusiastic fans around â parts of natural process of fame and glory. What they do not want â to leave bad reviews so there were no complaints on them, especially among fans of the environment of Edward Kleban, not to leave badness after criticâs life, in order to not become unworthy of respect. After leaving a bad crit, against such critic can manifestations gather & his work may be subsequently boycotted. That's the logic., , Therefore, they do sugary comments, deaf and filled with empty words, which express the overall positive thoughts. For example, they say that this musical is full of buzzwords, great music, magnificent and elegant dance, acting of 8 actors who deserve a standing ovation. The striking difference between ""real"" reviews & reviews ""from necessity"" lies in it. Where in the actual review, any critic, even the most mediocre, will practice in the derivation and talkativeness, sophisticatedly clothing their dim ideas in bright tinsel of synonymous wrappers, putting belching of own brain activity as an incredibly wit revelation that everyone should read agape. Here, on the contrary â all comments are clear, dispassionate, abound in simple words. What does it mean? That all knockers envy the fact that after the life of their colleague, musical was done. They were willing to die so that after their lives people did the same, but as they still here, they write something like âmagnificent play blah-blahâ., , But as ordinary viewers are alien of all this secret equilibristic, they come only having the desire to amuse themselves in a cold evening, so this musical did not last more than 100+ shows and has been closed due to decline of popularity. Yes, it's a story about a man. Outstanding one. But what is the fundamental difference of this musical from hundreds of others? It is just an average. For example, we liked more Best Little Whorehouse In Texas. Not because of the name or the content, but because it was simply bright. Do you want more vivid musical? Take Chicago, whether on stage or as a Hollywood movie starring Richard Gere. If you want a bright show, watch The Lion King. If you want drama and thriller, visit The Phantom Of The Opera. Want something cute and fluffy? Cats would be the best answer. To say that this musical arbitrarily exceeds at least one of these in any way, would be a great deception."
"99","Closer Than Ever ","    It is good, what in musical star those who have already gone through a lot of events in their life. For example, would you believe the actor of 25 years has been going through a second marriage & a midlife crisis? So the same we would not have believed this. Therefore, looks quite attractive reasonable decision of Richard Maltby, Junior, the main creator of this musical, to hire experienced actors who are over 40, so that they appear in the event. This histrionics shows following eternal truths: unrequited love, marriage, divorce, adulthood, intercourse. All of the topics that will always be chafing the minds of Humankind, no matter what century is now, or what level of computerization of your environment is. Because you will always go through these stages in your life â there's no avoiding it., , What's great about this particular performance â a powerful party of each of the actors. There are only four of them, so that they can use any size of the stage, even a super-compact. Further, each of them has very mature voice, strong and bright as, for example, Jenn Collela. Very powerful soprano of Christiane Noll makes one think about standing applauding to her. Strong songs in a musical without the libretto â interesting creative option â make it possible to appreciate the musicality of the show, not diluted with boring things like conversations., , There is no such thing as plot & it is somewhat negative. Despite 300+ productions of this histrionics, there could be greater amount if there was at least some hint on history, through which the viewer could consistently move from song to song. Typically, musicals without a plot not cause bright sympathies, because they are in such case become a simple set of scenes, which emerges at the audience as flashes from the past or reflections about the present/future. For true connoisseurs of pure singing musicals, this is clearly delight for auditory nerves. But for those who came to see the plot â and these are often the majority â there will be nothing., , Each song has its own character, from bright expressive to a very depressive, with the mood may changing diametrically literally within 10 minutes. Different in appearance and character, actors do not cause bright adoration by their outer look & some may even find them repulsive. But what musicality they create & what light image from the show remains to the audience â this bribes a lot."
"100","Colma ","    The film tells the story of three teenagers who do not know how to find themselves in this life and still are only at the beginning, which revealed to be a large, long, wide and branching road that is called simply ""life"". Many Asians and dark-skinned young people from the audience of the film were identifying themselves with these characters, according to their confessions, as they faced with quite the same issues and problems, as on a screen., , Despite the overall budget of USD 15 thousands, which was assembled by the principle ""string by string from the world"", and probably even sponsored by the parents of its producers â H. P. Mendoza and Richard Wong, it turned out pretty good, as for the debut work. Of course, it's not Sam Mendes, who received an Oscar for his debut in the cinema, but this work was also destined to receive 5 prizes, which is pretty comforting. Audience choice or something like that in the rank., , Colma â the film â is named after the tiny town, a suburb of San Francisco, where only a small amount of 1800 inhabitants live, has more than a dozen cemeteries, including a cemetery for pets. Remarkably, with so many ""dead residents"", its motto â âIt's great to be alive in Colmaâ. Ridicule or a very subtle irony â we do not say, let everyone decide for himself or herself. Maybe suddenly someone would love to live in this town after watching the movie? What's nice in the city â it is coastal, like many in sunny California, a state to which it belongs, has many beautiful beaches. Donât you doubt, the film will unfold on one of them as well. , , This musical shows a talent of one of participants of much more popular film â Van Wilder, â namely, his Indian assistant (Kal Penn), who even prime-starred in the sequel. Though he is not in the credits, but it is him on the #1 photo. By the way, according to official sources, the box office is a little more than 41 thousand, so probably H. P. Mendoza returned his investments., , Depressing lack of professional equipment for movie resulted in poor sound recording. But even so, it turned out in quite decent art-house musical, which can be viewed at leisure, if you have a couple free hours."
"101","Color Purple","    Oprah Winfrey, who fiercely promoted this her child, was born in Chicago herself (she is a nominee for the Oscar too), and therefore it was decided to start the national show of musical from there. The success of one was largely predetermined by a huge advertising company and the focus of several bright local celebrities when it opened, making this musical a must-visit social event., , Largely thanks to Oprahâs personal efforts, this play has become well-known and very well earned on tickets & related matters. Oprah Winfrey named her production company as âHarpoâ. The same was one of the protagonists of the musical. Is it a coincidence? We donât think so. They were mutually promoting. This is the first thing that strikes viewer who somehow familiar with the activities of this remarkable woman. Did you know that once Oprah, whose name has become a common noun, arranged week-end for all her employees of a large corporation on a sunny beach in the midst of a winter in the warm country at her own expense, spending many tens of millions of dollars? Or, once at Christmas, she gave to all the staff cheques from 10 to 50 thousand dollars. Here's how you need to love your subordinates â who are doing everything possible for you, thanks to whom you make a fortune., , As for the musical, it's hard to believe that on its production as many as 11 million have been spent. For example, the most expensive props in the history of musical production was a full-size car for a stunning 0.5 million Pounds Sterling. But it is only about 700 thousand dollars. And it was in another play. Where could such huge amount go? Come what may, this musical has paid off at the box office in just 1 year. All the rest of the time it earned in his box a lot of money, they say, about USD 200 million. Of course, this result had been achieved thanks to Oprah Winfreyâs personal insistence mostly., , Lively characters, interesting lighting solutions (lighting of scene as if the rising of sun or sunset â the same soft and warm), gorgeous authentic outfits. In the middle of it there is a girl named Celie, which is sold into slavery, only disguised as marriage, but the essence is the same: hard work, necessity of living with a person who treats you very badly. Years later she divorced him, discovered her talent to create pants with interesting innovative design, which were in demand. However, her husband also decided at the end of own long time being ""in a bottle"" to acknowledge that he must change. We do not recommend to throw your husbands or to go through an alcoholic delirium, to come to understanding that it is never too late to become a better person. On the contrary, we encourage you to watch this musical â it had just been resumed on Broadway, so you can see the inner world of the characters and go through the suffering of Celie with her, where she reveals genius."
"102","Commentary","    Low-budget film that allowed two young actors who are now successfully shot in the serial movies to practice their acting talent (Neil Patrick Harris, which for all of us known best for the role of very photogenic bro from How I Meat Your Mother and Simon Helberg, which we know from the mega-popular TV series about geek-scientists, The Big Bang Theory). By the way, the young Neil and Johnny Galecki also knew each other. And now, two of his friends, Simon Helberg and Johnny Galecki, work together for a long time in a single production., , Youth musical, which is called in the final version as Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog (being so named for the rentals), is no different neither with something fantastic, or in terms of performance, nor in plot or the general content. It displays rather moderate amplitude of emotions, as if the actors were working on 70%, if not less. Listen to the video Heart, Broken, that is attached here in the ""Video"" section and compare, for example, The Music Of The Night, that masterfully was done by Michael Crawford (simple search on YouTube brings you the desired result) â and you'll understand the difference in the investing of efforts that make the different actors., , The production was so low-budget that all the profits that were raised from the running of one on DVD and iTunes (and so on), were divided between the creative team and actors who werenât paid during the shooting. Joss Whedon, who directed it (known to us for such very popular TV series Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Angel, film The Cabin In The Woods, and who also works on realization of Marvel comics), did not have the money from producers and attracted actors to the project only with own loud name, so they signed up to work for a percentage of sales. But, he said that the project has brought a total of USD 3 million, which allowed fully pay all bills and he called it ""commercially successful""., , The project has multiple awards. Among them: Streamy Award in 2009, Audience Choice Awards (with which the best TV broadcasts in the web awarded) in the categories Best Male Actor (of course, this is for main handsome buddy, Neil Patrick Harris â who would doubt it). Best Directing and Best Writing â went to one person, Joss Whedon, performing here both of these works. Hugo Award was received in the category Best Dramatic Presentation, and the Best Internet Phenomenon Award â in a category Primetime Creative Arts. Among other awards, it has an Outstanding Special Class. It has a little less nominations. For example, in 2008 the musical was granted with Constellation Awards in two categories, but won neither., , Critics generally noted that the main two people who should be praised for this work â Neil Patrick Harris and Joss Whedon, on whose shoulders this work relied and was able to obtain a commercial profit. Neil, moreover, had previously played in the theater, including musicals. So he has all the vocal parts better than any other actors in this musical. His voice is recognizable almost immediately, thanks to the wait for it, wait for it... charisma of the brow."
"103","Company ","    This musical is a perfect staging for those in adulthood, between 30 and 100 years â for all active and really adult category of all ranges, to whom it is no longer enough to laugh at just plain text jokes or because somewhere boomed something funny or someone did a funny face. No, here, via light drama, a lot of humor is shown. Of that kind of humor that, like wine, is aged better over the years and is inherent to smart and respectable people who are in the middle of period ""I do not have anything from a teenager already"" or ""I am warned of the inevitability of death and the upcoming sunset, so let us be satisfied by the best benefits of civilization that are available to me now, as long as my personal sun is still in the zenith, and maybe was just beginning to lowering towards the horizon"". At this stage, which is often called as a ""midlife crisis"", people reflect about the issues of self-worthiness, which they will be forced to adopt. The alternative is to buy a red racing car (if you're a man) or to get a new lover, young, bursting with verve and passion, if you are a woman. Well, in the second case there can be an updated wardrobe. Or a change of country of residence, if you are rich enough to afford it., , The musical tells the story of the soul scatterings of several people. The main storyline is the life of one overage bachelor who cannot choose between the three girls whom he dates. However, one of them, Kate, leaving him going to another city because she found the groom., , Steven Sondheim, who performed the words and music for this musical, won both main Tony Awards. It is easy and very pleasant narrative show that received big spectrum of awards. 5 Drama Desk, 1 Theatre World, 7 Tonies wins and 8 nominations â all this for the original staging. For its reopening in 1995, the list is as follows: 1 Drama Desk nomination, 2 Tonies nominations, 3 Lawrence Olivier wins and 1 nomination. For the next revival in 2006, it gained 3 Drama Desk wins & 2 nominations, 1 Tony win & 1 nomination., , This is a new vision of the good old musical of 1970, which was called with the long name Everything's different,/Nothing's changed,/Only maybe slightly/Rearranged. By the way, it was discussed filming a motion picture, and the latest information about it was in 2010, but since then the project was a bit rusty. It is one of those smart (but not abstruse), laconic (but not fragmentary), fancy (but not glamorous) and wise (but not mentoring) musicals, with a heart and soul that you can watch over and over again, each time catching different notes from actors, comparing them among themselves. In addition, fans of creativity of Neil Patrick Harris will be interested to see their idol in this show. One of the things that changed in recent versions â the protagonist speaks openly about his gay orientation, whereas in all previous it was tacitly silenced. However, he wants to build his relationships with women. At least, he is revealing that. Perhaps the underlying reason of his bachelor life is just that society, in persons of his associates, wants to see him with women, while he sees himself with a man. Pretty deep subject that is very easy, as no one imposes no point of view, simply touching it without developing."
"104","Connecticut Yankee","    At the opening on Broadway in 1927, it was the biggest hit of that time, which, if extrapolated to today's time, can be compared to The Phantom Of The Opera, with its 12+ thousands views., , What's remarkable about it? The plot is already described in the section ""Synopsis"". Apart from this flamboyant component, this exuberant musical contained very colorific actresses â as in the original version (fiery sipid beauty Constance Carpenter and June Cochrane â the latter also liked to appear nude in a variety of magazines and printed publications), as well as in its resurrection, which took place in WWII wartime (Vivienne Segal). And even later in the movie of 1949 (Rhonda Fleming)., , What is the difference of Old Hollywood from the modern? Apart from the obvious disadvantages such as black-and-white photos and videos, hissing sound, as it was no good equipment that is now generally available to anyone who has at least Nokia, not to mention the Samsung Galaxy, the old Hollywood had its own charm. Excellent haircuts, clothes, styles and high attention to the overall scenery. Maybe then the theater was much too outlier in terms of showing emotions and acting, too ornate by today's times, where people very exaggerated their play, but they took more sincerity and dedication. Profession of actor was not considered as a tool for the popularity and earning a lot of money, but as something magical, with restricted access, a circle, which adopted only favorites. This gave birth to such masterpieces, which could hold out on the stage nearly 500 plays, that today is comparable to 10 000. Inflation in the theater is similar to the inflation of money., , You only look at the dress of Constance Carpenter â charming, like her smile, coupled with the professional game â is an example of how a person should reveal herself on the scene., "
"105","Contact ","    Critics generally were favorable to the emergence of this musical where the actors themselves were dancers or dancers were actors (hard to say, because they are of the same quality did both). Unlike most musicals, where there are many running and bustle, where many actors are casted to deploy out the story line, this dance performance attracts to itself not clear with what. There is no single bright scene or a phenomenal acting game, nor even bright costumes. What is here â a good ensemble, intelligent flow of emotions and it is completely filled with dance, from beginning to end. Critics also noted that it has revived the orderly flow of the emotional component, which was not vivid enough in cynical musicals of 1990â2000 due to what the true magic of the theater was born. It was compared with the musicals that are being made by Rodgers & Hart, evidently allowing themselves unfettered assessment of the high quality of the final product. It's like the work of a director in the field of cinema to be compared with those of Tarantino, acknowledging so ingenious material flow, filled with fine lines of humor, eclectics, emotional components, as the fantastic work of this maestro., , It has Tony Award for Best Musical in 2000, for best choreography, best actress and best actor. 3 Drama Desk Awards. 1 nomination for Tony Award for the best actress., , All the songs in this production are pre-recorded, no one sings live. Although this production positions itself as a musical, but it has almost no conversation, the actors do not sing but only dance. However, its format â only small details that do not affect the overall success of the show. The number of its plays only on Broadway (1010) allowed it to enter the top of those musicals that have currently more than 1,000 hits, which is considered quite successful., , During the dance, the performers do different numbers including using of the classical music (Tchaikovsky), contemporary (The Beach Boys), and other (same Rodgers & Hart). The audience here will see both group and solo dances that were masterfully choreographed by Susan Stroman, who combined this activity with directing and was a general creator of the show. Dance styles are different also, from the ballet to swing. Some dancers (K. Kuhl or M. F. Wild) have demonstrated the acrobatic training, showing an example of a very frank dance that excites., , Each part tells stories through dance. Someone escapes from their daily downtrodden being. Someone finds a fresh air from emotions raging inside, showing along that in everyday life, this person is no different from the rest and is the creation of mystical dancing is held only today and only now."
"106","Copacabana ","    The show was very popular. But after visiting Sweden in 2005, as the last time of professional show, in more than 10 years since then, it hadnât been produced. The initial idea was to turn a single song in a musical. We could say, it was a success, because the show had visited both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, in the most prestigious theater places on the planet â Broadway and West End., , This show is for those who do not like classical theater (with its boring drama, to be or not to be...) and prefers to fill his being with bright musical. Vivid, spectacular, fantastic, flamboyant. The same stunning as this certainly an outstanding event. It is admirable literally in every detail. From clothes and plastic of movements, as a result of the choreography, ending with thoughtful libretto and lighting. Stage design, selection of actors â all aimed at the audience to get the most enjoyment. Hall were exploding with applauses after the number of Dancin' Fool, where the choreography is not 100% good, but the overall impression remains more than exciting. Just Arrived â a living example of the excellent choreography and thoughtful lyrics., , Costumes are designed by D. Pitchard, very elegant, suitable for each number. In the same Just Arrived they were one, a couple of dozen minutes later the audience was able to assess the full wardrobeâs transformation of actors. Here actors perform roles of dancers & musicians, so they can replace each other, reincarnating in different roles without any difficulty â a distinctive feature not only of the leaders of this musical, but The Watermill Theatre, where a play was., , Tickets for this show were sold-out like hot pies in cold wet weather. Here almost all of the drama omitted and it is the single biggest negative issue that can be imputed to the scenario of Barry Manilow. However, we have assumed that Barry wanted to create something light and not at all dramatic, so easily accept the fact that this disadvantage can be safely ignored. With the same ease with which this show pours at you if you were lucky enough to grab one of the few remaining tickets on it."
"107","Corpse Bride ","    The worldwide box office of this musical film grossed a little more than USD 117 million, which paid it almost three times. This work is the result of a creative collaboration of Tim Burton, his dearly beloved wife (although officially she was his partner) Helena Bonham Carter and his personal friend Johnny Depp, with whom acquaintance and cooperation, and then a stronger relationship had arisen, starting from the knowing each other during the work on the film Edward Scissorhands, which has made Johnny Depp from a shy youngster to a great celebrity. Now he can afford in his 52 years of age to marry Amber Heard, an actress of 29 years (after all, nearly half his age)., , Strong tandem of the trio afterwards did a few more appearances in other films, invariably becoming fantastically successful. Each of them, where this trio was, collected huge box office and became a cult (or close to it). Furthermore, in addition to Corpse Bride, are: Sleepy Hollow, Alice in Wonderland & others â it is a very close cooperation that allows these friends to be like strange trio in the film, where Helena Bonham Carter played, though without the obligatory participation of the other two â Fight Club, where Tyler Durden slept with Marla Singer, and then it turned out that Tyler was another guy. Is it deniable that the same did not occur behind closed doors of the trio? Whatever it was, half the world is awfully happy with stunningly spectacular films that see the light due to the same unique talent of Tim Burton, as Isaac Azimov in the world of science fiction. All movies, where they worked, or at least, where Burton-Depp were, proved justified grossing & were very successful., , This story is an example of the niche, which took Burton in modern cinema â gloomy and dark contrast to bright brilliancy of Disney. Almost always half the characters of all his works are either dead or live in an unreal, distorted world. Thoughts of death are shrouded with an attractive aura of the dark side of life, of which few people think, as long as they donât touch it. Tim, with his unexpected vision, is able to show the audience nice dead, charming zombies & cheerful frankendogs. And a bigger bunch of hard-hitting characters., , In this work, he used a non-standard technique of shooting of movie on still cameras, and then glued the frames, shooting puppets. Latter have such features of appearance and the face that are the brightest parody of the specific & especially memorable characters, which are full in our lives. A parody on the hairstyle by mother of Victoria or comically low, with the figure of a sphere, husband, who married out of necessity, not out of love. How they came out with such a pretty daughter â a huge mystery., , All terribly interesting, that could be shown by Tim Burton, he expressively, but succinctly shown in this film, full of dark tones and the grim colors, which can be called as one of our most favorite motion pictures. And, since this is not a stage musical, you can watch it at home on your TV or computer for an infinite # of times, enjoying a delicious supply of gothic imagery and surroundings, so phenomenally sensitively given by the creative team."
"108","Crazy For You ","    What most critics liked it in this production â the fact that it clearly differs from many other, boring and melancholic shows, that literally has captivated Broadway for over a decade, when the most famous play Cats of that time was there, itself very slow and not charging with high energy. Here, on the contrary, heat of youth radiates from everywhere, a lot of movement and a constant running around the stage to increase the degree of dynamism of the story to new heights. Such high that they are reviving the musical standards of Gershwin, who skillfully used the stage as a painter uses his canvas when working with oil paints. Shubert Theater, which is on Broadway, New York, is the center of untethered happiness, youthful energy and fantastic fun. Besides the fact that in the story are tied as much as 3 (and in the end â as many as four) love stories, major is the fifth line â which revolves around the local cabaret-type theater, which a greedy bank wants to take as collateral for the outstanding loan, but a spunky young person decides to try to save it, staging there a musical of his own invention. He does that as he loves a local girl very much and she is a daughter of the owner of this cabaret in this decaying town., , Musical turned out quite successful precisely because of its young dynamism. The scenery and props were changed on the stage as fast and uncomplicated as the main characters fall in love with each other. Is it necessary to change the place of deployment of the theater made of papier-mÃ¢chÃ©? Sure, not a problem! Thanks to its fervent spontaneity, it has acquired a large number of awards. In 1992, it had two wins of the Drama Desk Award and 6 nominations for that. 3 wins of Tony (including for Best Musical) and more 6 nominations. For staging in London in 1993 â 3 wins of Laurence Olivier Award and 4 nominations. For the renewal in 2012, it won two Laurence Olivier Awards, including for Best Musical., , Although the Shubert Theatre is too ""cozy"" to take the London productions, it has fully coped with the task, allowing musical to play over 1600+ hits of the original show. Together with all of its renewals and, of course, along with three years in the West End, the musical has about 3,000 plays that is quite serious figure for such a young, playful and passionate musical like this."
"109","Cry-Baby ","    There have been following awards given to this musical: Tony Award â 4 nominations; Drama Desk Award â 1 win (for best choreography) â and all this in 2008, for the original musical. Its continuation hadnât receive neither awards nor nominations., , The musical, like the original film, has got mixed reviews. On the one hand, the film Cry Baby in 1990, in which, besides Johnny Depp, Iggy Pop acted, has become a cult for several years. On the other hand, it never paid off, because it was too specific and talent of the young Depp in this film was not fully disclosed. The plot of the musical, in principle, was exactly the same, with only those obligatory modifications that are required to release it to the stage. More music, the presence of the libretto â all these are understood changes. Critics were divided into two camps, as well as those who watched the movie. One liked its young energy and a lot of humor, which almost never stopped pouring down from the stage. It was sometimes brash, sometimes on the verge of a foul, when the actors begin to play too much. For example, in the scene where the girl said, ""today is Thursday, and I'm not pregnant on Thursdays"". Critics also have compared it with the very popular Hairspray. On the other hand, others called it not only tasteless, but also having savor of a disgusting chewing gum, which was chewed week ago to complete exhalation, and its characters were even called ""putrid"". In fact, looking at the pompous fat woman (no matter, if there was a pillow under her dress or she really was with this inflated round belly), which was very sloppy and didnât take care after herself, whose self-esteem was at the level of spoiled princess, you can believe that some of the critics who disapproved the play, were eventually right., , Waters, who worked here as the director, was unable to repeat his most brilliant production â already mentioned Hairspray. This production can be called as fade parody on it. Although there was an interesting, lively, but not protruding, vulgarity, we cannot call its owners as interesting or musical in general, with its whole aura, as exciting. Feed of the material made as if in hasty style, just to read the text of his/her role and to play fast so to go home as quickly as possible â  such a desire is felt from every second actor. Spectators were watching as if detached, almost without any empathy to the scene heroes. There were, indeed, a couple dozen of very successful jokes, but they do not allow to pull the musical up, to become at least a little more successful. Total of 60+ regular shows on Broadway â it is even less than 1 season. Musical not inflames you, as you expect from a stage production as a spectator, exchanging your evening to watch a performance. Obviously, many such expectations were deceived."
"110","Curtains ","    Despite controversial opinions about the musical, most of people liked the execution of role of Detective Frank Cioffi, who moonlighted as the savior of the show on Broadway. There is no mistake â this is a Broadway show about a show that is held on Broadway, in which a series of murders occurs. Quite a notable success in the form of 511 regular performances and 23 previews brilliantly crafted by character of savvy police lieutenant, served a good job., , Peter Stone, who wrote the book, died in 2003 without completing his creation, but the concept proved to be quite successful and this technique â solving the murder on a homicide scene, as sort of a mini-detective story, where everything is based on the words and the play of actors within limited space, is often used. For example, And Then There Were None, the successful creation of Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller, better known as Agatha Christie, the most successfully used the technique of unfolding the detective story within a limited time and even more limited space, where at least one professional investigator among present persons was included., , Despite the above-average length, critics expressed not only positive for its production. For example, some said that at full capacity only the 2 or 3 lead actors were working, when the others were like a firecracker, which is lying on the ground waiting for ignition, concluding an untapped potential of great latent power. Just like this musical, which had not enough passion to ignite the audience, because of the lack of sparks. Others continued this streamline, claiming that it was sluggish, starting from completely uninteresting stage design and fade costumes, bright part of which was hidden and saved up until the final curtain, ending with understated choreography and complete hash in an event flow that did not allow not only to catch the glue what was happening on the stage, but neither allowed to get the pleasure from this histrionics., , But it is unlikely, in fact, that this show was so boring as it had many international plays, some of which have even been for a month or more, such as in Australia. In the UK, the show went for a whole summer of 2012, with very positive responses, such as: ""the show is a great classic comedy performance, which, despite some insignificant flaws, is very funny and beautifully craftedâ. Scotland, where the show was staged in May of the same year, also distinguished by the absence of bad reviews. New Zealand with the month of run, and the Irish premiere with a week of staging, as well as other ones â in the Czech Republic, Germany, and Canada again â never have been talking about the poor quality of the show, but quite the contrary., , As for the awards, the show possesses very good figures, which for times overcome even musicals of the top ten. 7 Tony nominations and one win; 8 nominations for the Drama Desk Award and two wins â the total amount is even better than ones having over a thousand hits."
"111","Damn Yankees ","    This musical tells the story that periodically flares up here and there as the subject of relations with the Devil, when some ordinary person wants to sell his soul for the fulfillment of secret desires (or one desire, as in this case). An ardent fan of a professional baseball team longs them to win from Yankees, and is ready to sell his soul for it. The devil suddenly comes to him in the guise of Applegate. As it often happens, the devil is in the end of the story turns out to be beaten by his own weapon â deceit â and the soul remains with a man. A popular move. The deception of the Devil was clearly illustrated in the film Bedazzled of genius Harold Ramis, in 2000 (who, unfortunately, passed away a few years back), with Brendan Frazer and Elizabeth Hurley. Elizabeth represented seductive The Devil. A similar topic is covered in the movie The Devil's Advocate (1997) â not a comedy, as in the first case, but an acute social work, with much more professional dramatic actors â Keanu Reeves & Al Pacino. All these films and many others, including the stories, is a reference to the classic Faust by Goethe. This bright German legend goes back to the ancient beliefs of the first proto-Christian tribes. In this global backbone, Mankind in general tends to work out the different interpretations, based on original material. It would seem that The Master and Margarita is very far from Damn Yankees, but basically they have the same roots, retold quite differently and, as a result, there are two stories possessing radically different content. Damn Yankees has turned out more like a sitcom, which became popular much later and it is easy to guess, this musical was performed for a specific audience â the Americans, where athletic achievement interwoven, along with the love to the team, as well as family values, such as the inviolability of the Family and eternal love, which stands above the Devil himself with all his strength., , Undoubtedly, history and legend, as the basis of it, are strong. Apart from them, the musical also has its charm in presenting the information. Its main characters are all quite cute, but Gwen Verdon, as it seems for us, is too dim to be a seductive woman. Future incarnations of her also entirely unconvincing. Even in 1994. The general impression of the musical remains positive â no least you expect from such a thing on Broadway that lasted for more than 1,000 hits originally, not including its renewal and other performances, in particular, on West End. By the way, the resurrection on Broadway brought 718 new regular shows in 2008. Despite the presence of the last resurrection, the 1994th version is considered a classic., , For version of 1950, musical has such awards: 7 Tonies (incl. for Best Musical) and 2 nominations; 1994 â 1 Tony and 3 nominations, 1 Drama Desk win & 2 nominations, 2 Theatre World Awards. 1997's in London gave another 3 nominations, this time for Laurence Olivier."
"112","Dance of the Vampires ","    Michael Crawford was asked to participate and it became a huge mistake. He was a star of the show The Phantom of the Opera. Crawford did numerous attempts of intervention into the production process and demanded huge wages and other buns., , This musical for a long time was worked-out and to its development celebrities handed, such as Roman Polanski, the creator of the original film, Michael Crawford, with its exorbitant financial demands and paranoid about to play the most unlike to his only notable role â The Phantom of the Opera, one of the immortal works of genius Andrew Lloyd Weber. Sonenberg, who was a creative producer, was able to draw the necessary funding and the musical was launched. Although it was planned to stage on Broadway in 2000, and later â in 2001, in 2000 these plans come untrue due to inability of Roman Polanski to visit US personally. In 2001 â a terrorist crisis prevented, which later became known worldwide as the 9/11, as the production was carried in London, and aircrafts began to delay, logistics had complicated, boundaries of time shifted when new musical could be produced to get a Tony Award nomination and so on, so its start was shifted to autumn., , In addition to Crawford, the team of actors included: L. Hocking, M. von Essen, R. Auberjonois, R. Orbach & M. Gonzalez. On paper, everything looked great â a big star with a good experience, the director, who won the Tony in his life, the composer who wrote the fantastic rock operas. But when the rehearsals started, it became clear that the musical was just a bunch of nothing. Actors began to fight and made fun of Crawfordâs gown and himself, calling him fat cock, he also threw back many great ideas. Choreographer was completely unprofessional, because his vision of the choreography consisted of a pair of words, and the director could not cope with the production of this scale. As a result, even the original developer of the script in German noted that the director and his star Crawford could not come to a final view, whose ideas were better and just ruined everything, nothing included in the final version. The director was absent for several weeks due to family reasons. Steinman and Sonenberg fired each other from the musical, being mutually tied as the producers of the show., , Based on the famous name of Crawford, the producers finally started selling tickets for the ""runaway train"", which went on its own, not in the direction as it supposed to be, did with great difficulty and experienced the loss of a few actors, having a hard shouting in the process between all. Its outgone version differed with inconsistency and obscure game, and its humor was met with minor approval and huge flurry of criticism. For example, a cover version of Total Eclipse Of The Heart â was full of disgusting arrangement, the voice did not keep any synchronization with music, and the overall impression was left simply heinous., , Despite attempts to remake the costumes and to rewrite the script to make this freak show to be a normal musical, everyone did not like too dapper suits of vampires with their silly high collars and a lot of sense-able ideas were still rejected by a team of actors and directors. Due to the constant movements of the material and the fact that Crawford was constantly putting some of his jokes, to test the best, his partner was suffering from his jokes were constantly cut off and they were always quarreling with Crawford on this occasion. Before the start, they kind of made up, but it only gave the opportunity for show to be completely banned by critics."
"113","Dear World ","    Jerry Herman, who wrote the music and libretto, with the launch of this, became the first of his cohort, who had three own works running simultaneously on the stages of Broadway. Leading actress, won Tony for this work & O. Smith received a nomination for best stage design. No more other awards or nominations this musical possesses., , Having opened in 1969, it is not an original work, like many other musicals that are based on earlier films or books or short stories â most of Broadway are like this. It is a free-style adaptations of a story of 1945, which was a short play concluded a political satire. The one was written in 1943 by Jean Giraudoux and first published after his death. This narration is a French play and it is very popular in France, where it had a greater variety of resurrections than in the United States. Based on it, many plays and other musicals done, which involve popular local actresses., , The musical tells of very old, sweet and gentle woman who lives quietly in her little world, in the basement of the local cafÃ© and experiencing the loss of her beloved, without causing harm to anyone, and seeing the world through rose-colored glasses. Once her life brutally interfered by local authorities (in a variety of interpretations â greedy businessmen) and now she struggles to keep her little world as it is, comfortable for her. Why this musical is popular? Because of the fact that many people are familiar with the concept of comfort, which is now, in the modern business world that rushes from morning till night, trying to make all the money in the world, is threatened and the very cozy existence now called by the hideous concept of ""comfort zone"" from which someone always advises to someone to go out of. Not realizing at the same time that such a comfort is like a blister for shells, to someone in the world is a whole world & the meaning of very existence and to leave it is a blasphemous crime against his or her very essence. Especially when you're old and experienced many, many changes around you in life and now just want to spend quietly your days and evenings., , Despite, however, acceptable for many, concept that would enjoy the older generation in particular, the musical received mostly negative feedback. What specifically did criticasters not like? Firstly, songs, that were represented by respected Time magazine as ""complete nonentity"". Secondly, the libretto, which was put down by every critic. Thirdly, a very simple story seemed even too complex for some ones, who could not keep a track of it. However, what is good for French, for Americans can to be too unclear, because the concept itself â to live a quiet life, without disturbing anyone, protecting your cozy space â may seem incomprehensible to a nation accustomed to run somewhere and to achieve something. However, nothing surprising, because, in the end, not the citizens of USA invented croissants and small cafÃ©s on 2 â 4 tables. No, their destiny is Wall Mart, Star Bucks & McDonalds â places where the sale of items is put on such a large flow that the concept of ""stop & think, rest & read a book with a coffee cup, breathe the aroma of fresh baking"" is blasphemous."
"114","Dirty Rotten Scoundrels ","    10 nominations and only one award â there is not very equitable distribution of prizes. Although the word ""equitable"" probably not appropriate. ""Vexation"" â that is the correct word. Because the film is worthy more than a musical. Indeed, the latter has absolutely no charm of enchanting delicate act of Michael Caine or amazing, phenomenal, incredible comedic talent of Steve Martin. The two created a charming film, which in 1988 brought decent 40+ million dollars in worldwide box office and was marked by critics with inclusion in a hundred of funniest movies ever. Indeed, the atmosphere is relaxed and fraud the same lightweight. Fun accompanies the film from beginning to an end. A bright sun of the Riviera, where our characters live, is not embodied in the musical, which is played by too young actors so that they can be considered credible for their roles. Jokes largely mirror those of the film, but it also has its own work. However, rather a vision of them in a new way. For example, in the film, Ruprecht banged on the pods and his ""brother"" told him to stop because they soon will have no pods at all. In musical, Ruprecht was trying to eat a goldfish and ""brother"" tells him that he cannot eat pets; they have already lost a few cats like this. Playing on the similarity, indeed. But it is almost the only joke that sounded funnier in the musical than in the movie., , On the other hand, a musical had a youthful enthusiasm, which only slightly overlaps the lack of life experience, which is âa mustâ when it comes to creating the image of a stunning fraudsters. Maybe all the obvious shortcomings prevented this musical to receive any significant awards? Besides the already mentioned 10 nominations for Tony and 1 win only, this show has two nominations for Laurence Olivier with zero wins and 9 nominations with 1 win for Drama Desk Award. On the one hand, a number of nominations could say that many = considered this piece funny and insightful. On the other, this could happen because there were simply no more worthy nominees for awards on Broadway in 2005."
"115","Disney's Beauty And The Beast ","    Tours of this musical in the USA were so ambitious that for all the time it saw 137 cities and it has been seen by more than 5.5 million people, including Canadian spectators. In 2010, when 4th tour was launched, all the costumes for it and all the stage props have been completely redesigned. Tour on Great Britain was not so scalable â only 2 years, from 2001 to 2003., , The original musical on Broadway won 1 Tony Award & were nominated on another 8. It was not granted with any Drama Desk victories, but was noted in 10 categories of nominations., , What is the most memorable in this musical after watching it? Firstly, it is a beautiful story that is drawn in different versions â in musical, cartoon, or even series, which was moved to New York with Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), in which she played until the gaining of widespread popularity thanks to Terminator 2 movie. Secondly, this is another retelling of how some girl becomes a princess. In addition, we note that, like many of the princesses, she previously was intelligent and well-read, as well as self-sufficient, experiencing, however, yearning for the fact that she was surrounded by boring everything and everyone. And then, when events whirled about which she dreamed, she plunges headlong into the maelstrom, winning the grand prize as a result â a handsome prince., , The musical itself, in all its versions, is remembered by two fantastically beautiful things: the stage design and costumes. On these two items of expenditure, Disney spent out much, but in fact, it was worth it. If we calculate the total show number of all that this histrionics has given, weâll get something around 9,000 hits (Broadway + West End + 4 national tours in the US and 1 tour in the UK). As for the music accompaniment, here everything was done as expected at a high level â all works from Disney cannot not to have bright colors, both in music and in visual design. The same composer who did the soundtrack for the animated film, made it for the musical. Therefore, it is worth noting vibrant score for voice and orchestra, distinguishing the Disney., , So what, you ask, this musical doesnât have cons, but only advantages? In general, we can say that it is. When production performed with skillfulness and heart in all aspects, the actors act as a single organism, when this fabulous event is sponsored and organized by the company that won our hearts long ago and continues to do so with great success to this days, the cons may only be small and almost invisible. Of course, if you are an ardent fan of gloomy colors and will rather take your children to something like Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, you can find the main disadvantage of it as being too colorful and too vivid in surrounding environment. But, in our opinion, the only negative, which also might seem far-fetched to someone â a vivid contrast of the beauty of the heroine of the musical from its animated movie. In the latter, she was fantastically beautiful, unreal dazzling, to the pain in the eyes. But on the stage, it was an ordinary girl."
"116","Disney 60 Years of Musical Magic ","    Dedicated to all fans of Disneyâs creativity! This collection, which is about 5 hours and 50 minutes of the best tunes sorted out of all that Disney has done before 1997 (and then partially continued in the period when all 5 parts were produced during three subsequent years), 5 separate disks contain 130 melodies. Originally, each of which consisted of 25 tunes, but fans can rejoice, because there are even a little more! On average, each has 26 songs (plus one to the nominal amount)!, , The hearts of listeners, who are not even fans, allow to sing along with many songs, because the melodies are familiar to us from the very childhood. Assessing the collection as a whole we can safely give it 5 stars out of 5 because it contains almost all the tunes that are significant in the works of Disney, that formed tastes of several generations. Completely instrumental or with funny and kind voices of your favorite characters, a collection of 5 pieces is much cheaper than each disc separately, allows to forget about the environment of the outside world for 6 long hours, plunging headlong into the lightness of the music flowing through every fiber of the headphones., , Ardent fans will find, among others, songs from The Lion King, Aladdin, Mary Poppins, The Jungle Book, Cinderella, Bembi, Snow White, Mickey Mouse Club, Pinocchio, Pocahontas, Peter Pan, Toy Story and so on and so on."
"117","Do Re Mi ","    Of all the awards, the show has only one â Theatre World Award. 5 nominations for Tony has not brought any victories to a musical. However, it seems that many theatrical reviewers considered that even 1 award is a lot â this musical absolutely did not show anything that would distinguish it from the pile of others that were at this time on Broadway. For example, a music score is the overwhelming bunch shrilly and very loud songs. So that the earplugs would be the best thing you can take with you on this. And with too very rapid rate. Creators may have wanted to show the joy, vitality and cheerfulness of the spirit. If so, then they havenât damn succeeded, because all the critics did not like a single out of music numbers. Is that only sometimes it had been noted that Ethan Mordden wrote a song called Adventure, magically performed by Walker, for only which it may be interesting to hear the whole music score., , Of course, if you now make allowances for the fact that the musical was staged in the 1960s, when there was no Internet, it is easy to understand that people sometimes can go on a show for two or three interesting songs. Now spending your day dressing up, going out somewhere and listening to something, just waiting for your favorite moment â is a pure recklessness, when you can simply watch a recording on YouTube or to buy a specific song in a couple of clicks for the symbolic money, available even to the poor., , As for the scene â this was the only really remarkable thing, in which great efforts were invested. There even were 2 decoratorâs assistants, which usually does not happen, as vast majority of productions take 1, maximum 2 people, when there were as many as three. Libretto was also the weak point. It follows logically that the musical was reworked in the scenic show that staged in 1990s. Musicals with goodly elaborated libretto do not come for such a sad finale. On the one hand, this is an opportunity to show the stage creation to those who donât like musicals. On another hand, processing it into a different format and at the same time, not for television â it is a sign of bad luck., , Some critics called this a kind of gangster mix of Guys and Dolls & Bye Bye Birdie, and all wondered what exactly can the average viewer find interesting in some mobsters, who decided to do the music business, besides, not the most profitable one. Of course, jukeboxes in the 1960s were commonplace, but in the 2010s it has become so huge anachronism that the younger generation, who is reading these lines right now, is not clear at all why is it necessary to go somewhere in a cafe or bar, to listen to a couple of songs for $ 1â2 on the old buzzing vinyl. After all, at any time, even from your bed, it is possible to turn on a play of your favorite music from the little thing called the MP3 player and to enjoy it in the headphones of recorded music, or online radio, as much as necessary."
"118","Dracula ","    Despite the fact that this musical for a long time went on both sides of the ocean, and later â on different continents, with multiple resurrections and tours, it is pretty mediocre adaptation of the famous story. Makeup makes the Nosferratu-sided protagonist very similar to some of the deceased couple of hours ago, pale like a toadstool. Of course, he should be pale, yes. But not as a caricature! The entire scurf of languid tremor from that disappears from this species. Next â outfits. Let's start from the very Dracula. This high collar and strange pailettes and thingies on his shirt makes him not terrible scary Dracula, storm of Turks and ruler of the whole Wallachia, which expanded thanks to his govern (although in reality he was expelled from the throne four times, on the fifth he had either disappeared or was killed, or died in prison as a rebel), but some timid representative of the LGBTâcommunity. The huge minus in his karma. Music and choreography had no pervasion, as it should give. Even The Phantom Of The Opera is more mystically completed character than Dracula in version of this musical. For a bright comparison, take a look at The Music Of The Night by Michael Crawford (with Sarah Brightman), even maybe on YouTube and The Seduction from the list here, in the ""Videos"" section. You will immediately feel the difference, where there is a real seduction, and where is a faded parody of it. Heroes in the already mentioned The Seduction act as if counting in mind, how big fee they will receive for this week of work, but do not try to portray passion, seduction, confusion, rapprochement with caution, and finally â the power of lustful desire, where the number had to lead slowly to sum up its development. Andrea Bocelli, as we see it, would be an ideal candidate for the role of Dracula, but he is not an actor of musicals, but a singer with an operatic voice, so it is a pity that such a fantastic opportunity that could present Dracula in a musical, remained, for the most part, not implemented., , The musical, according to most critics, was just awfully mastered. Though it adhered to the main points of the storyline, which shows the true exquisite craftsmanship of Bram Stoker, later implemented in the famous Bram Stoker's Dracula with Keanu Reeves, Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder, but music was not original, recalling some echoes of Andrew Lloyd Webber. The acting has deprived the public of all suspense and horror, the first of which must be inherent to this story in any case. Too bad that Frank Wildhorn, who sometimes writes musicals and from time to time â pop songs, undertook such a complex work, with the intention of making a serious drama, but it turned out some kind of porridge, in which no one has invested enough of their effort nor hearts to craft something decent., , We can only praise the Universe for a 2007âs version that was staged in Austria, where was a normal production, which experienced great success; recording of music from there were falling into the charts at the high places, which partly can compensate the hideous original version."
"119","Dreamgirls ","    The creator of the show, Michael Bennett, unfortunately, died in 1987, after the resumption of show on a Broadway, otherwise he might show us much more vivid histrionics of his style. By that time, behind him was a great experience of stage productions. However, recovering from this tragedy, musical staged further, conquering not only a variety of cities but countries. In 1997 â 98 it began the next US tour, reviews of which from critics were quite enthusiastic. For example, the new director was praised for the fact that he was able to bring a new fashion and hairstyles. Stage design was fully in line to the delightfully light style of presenting information, glamorous and outrageous. Multiple tours, which continued in 2004 & 2009, contributed to the increasing popularity of international productions, as well as the revival of the musical on Broadway in 2001. In 2005 and 2006, in Philadelphia, staging of musical stayed for three months (1 season). The composer of the last production in 2006 was praised for the fact that he made music as the most paralleled to Broadway productions., , As a result of the success, it had a lot of awards and nominations. Tony â 7 nominations and 6 wins; Drama Desk â 6 nominations and 5 wins; 2 Grammy awards., , There was a musical band, Supremes, whose history is painfully similar to this musical. They have so many parallels, including the most important dramatic line, when the main singer in the trio was replaced by another that even Wiki has a separate section for an explanation of the differences and similarities between these two storylines. The film, which came out with a bunch of famous actors (Beyonce, Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy and others) had even more parallels. And now, as the musical reached the peak of its career, having transformed into a movie, much more viewers can underline a strong similarity with the Supremes, which is directly on the mouth. For example, Supremes band, possessing Diana Ross as the main singer, suffered severe loss when her former soloist, Florence Ballard, unable to withstand the depression after the replacement, died very young, aged just 32. In the musical, by the way, Effie rejoins with his co-workers in the band, to give the last concerto before their final disintegration, while in the life, a soloist, as we have just written, has died., , The film, more than a musical, exploits theme of the struggle for equality in the entertainment business between whites and blacks, as well as more clearly shows the nature of the producer of a band, Curtis, which aspires above all to money than to anything else. He changes soloist from disagreeable onto more flexible, so that she was more like a workhorse than a wayward person."
"120","Drowsy Chaperone","    Olivier Award, on which this musical was nominated for in 2008, did not bring any victories. Start of the tour in the USA and Canada, which opened in 2007 in Toronto, grabbed a few actors from Broadway. The show has been exhibited in more than 30 cities, including its initial location, Ahmanson Theatre, where it performed the pre-Broadway production. This musical is a parody on a certain musicals and comedy shows. A bit unusual format in which there is the real world, in which a story goes that the audience sees on stage, within which, in turn, takes a musical play. The story immerses the viewer in the atmosphere of the 1920s, where Greg Morrison and Lisa Lambert wrote the words and music together, using the concept of when the narrator comments on what is happening, in his own way, with the distortions of the original story, which is why much laughter added to situations., , In addition to New York, the show visited the West End twice, Japan, Los Angeles and had several tours in cities. It was very rich in wins of awards and nominations received. So it had: 8 Tony nominations, 5 wins; 7 nominations and same number of wins in Drama Desk Award; 1 win in Theater World Award; 5 nominations at Lawrence Olivier., , The show is brilliant staging that collectively, gathering all places where it had visited, has made about 1500 exhibitions. Not a super high figure, but above all, the show aims to generate humor and good mood. Initially, though, it was assumed that it would be a kind of potpourri of the best ideas of the old musicals, but eventually it got an independent production, with a very well thought-out plot, interesting characters, bright and clear motivation of each of them, sparkling humor and everything that has to be present in a good musical, for which you pay good money to exchange your evening for quality entertainment."
"121","Edges A Song Cycle ","    This work is a kind of contemporary style of musicals production, because it is not a classical at all. There are no lyrics in it. Absolutely. There are only songs without a break, going one after another, in which the emotions spill, allowing the viewer to get the full range of emotional colors, for which he came. Two people, being a 19-year-old graduates, received a grant for their further creations, winning from Jonathan Larson award a sum of decent money. The musical, which never made it to Broadway or to the West End, still has more than 100 shows in the world, on almost all continents. Classically, a continent that is deprived of attention, in addition to the Antarctic, is South America. For some reason, nobody produces musicals there. By the way, it is how to judge. Based on various models, the world has from 4 to 7 continents. If we consider 4â or 5â model, where both Americas are considered to be single, then yes â this musical did not get only to the Antarctic. However, to there no one arrives (with super-rare exceptions, when people want to make a significant something on this deep-frozen piece of land, just for fun)., , This histrionics is about 4 young people who find themselves in this big world, passing a range of emotions through a series of songs with a different coloring. In fact, that's all for the plot. After all, there isnât any. What you can be surprised of? First of all, the presence of unusual for a musical elements of social networking. In other shows, creators pass by this theme for several reasons. Firstly, it is a relatively recent phenomenon, of several years. Secondly, the majority of directors are mature people who deliberately ignore this trend. Just as before people once ignored the TV, before that â the radio, more before that â newspapers, and quite a long time ago âbooks. After all, all these inventions of Mankind, are accustomed, as social networks that became an integral part of our existence and radically changed the commerce and social interrelations, as well as the exchange with information. Thirdly, would you like to be 756th friend on Facebook? By the way, according to recent studies, really stable connections can be maintained with no more than 50 people, and real friends on Facebook, to which people turn for help, on average, are four. Everything else, including the hundreds or thousands, is already a fan club, followers, but not friends. Something like this is highlighted in this musical, along with the other main line â growing up, finding yourself."
"122","Elegies A Song Cycle ","    This musical is one of those substandard, in which there is lack of some of mandatory components (songs, words, dance and acting). There was no second. Not a single word without a song said in its production. This may seem to someone precisely what (s)he has come for, because a series of songs is its format and to expect a miracle of different format is simply unreasonable., , What is a musical about? About the bitterness of loss (a friend, mothers, other family member, a pet), the reasons for such (terrorist attack on America in 2001, the disease, even inclusive AIDS) and various forms of such sorrow. Here, everyone will find something that he can associate own, personal feelings that occurred to him or her in life. Most unfortunate is the one who will find similar emotions in every song â such a person has experienced everything. However, to say that it is hopelessly sad is also impossible, since it gives a full range of emotions â from complete obscurity to elation when you know that the worst is behind and now waiting for the new day that will bring mirth. And the next and still another next day, until once in the end, will feel that unwishfull memories were completely erased, even the reflection of the death of your beloved one. The worst thing is that we are afraid of â to die or to lose most loved one. Then life completely loses paints and becomes meaningless. However, with proviso. Which consists in the fact that as long as we remain alive, we must remember this, to try to re-enter in the usual track, and after a few years or a decade, we will keep the cherished memory of the departed, but will love him or her or it and will understand that we have to go on. Because sacrificing our lives in order to not feel the pain is a stupid thing to do. For example, the musical has one of the strongest songs of mother, who tells her daughters that soon she will die from cancer. How could you endure tears in such situation? And what words would you have picked for your own children, telling them such news? It is terribly difficult. Because this musical includes such strong emotions in songs, their cycle is filled with terrific shrill sense and correlation with the souls of everyone who visits it. Calling this spectacle a show, our tongue does not turn, but if you are a fan of tearful exhibitions â than visiting this, you will have plenty of reasons to cry. However, we believe that the main purpose of this musical â is to give such opportunity to the audience and when they to get out of the room with wet cheeks, the goal is achieved., , Five actors, five chairs on a minimalistic stage, only a piano as accompaniment, and so this format is very suitable for the production and understandable to all audiences. A couple of paintings hanging on the walls, completing the integrity of the scene decoration. We wish you a shrill evening in the company of sentimental songs and you will love this musical."
"123","Ernest in Love ","    Sweet and kind story that thanks to the renaming of own name, it is possible to receive some bonuses. For example, romantic love, around which revolves the story here. Or of another fact, of the adoption of one of the already adults characters. Which do not given with the agreement on marriage because they think his origins are of mud blood. In general, the snobbery of future mother-in-law is high already before the wedding, but the man is still not thinking about abandoning marriage because in the future she just will not give him life, but still wants to marry her daughter. We have known the same persons in the real life â full of bile, single, with a shattered family, wanting only to destroy a life of her daughter and so she remained single until her old age, or until a mother dies. Scary people! They donât want a nice & good life to anyone, first of all, to own daughter, and find a relief only in constant communication by phone. However, in this play, there were no phones invented so far, but after all, the essence remains the same. So, we have here two couples â friends-men and women who want to marry them, then not, and then again want to. Classic teeter-totter story, which in modern films and productions takes one or more couples, maybe even elderly, only changing the situation and circumstances., , Such stale and hardened musicals are adored by most critics, the vast majority of whom â themselves in the musty and hidebound age when they are freshly retired or did so 20 years ago. So their only consolation is watching musicals based on more than a hundred years-old-plot to admire dresses, elegance and charm of ones. Of course, here are plenty of them. History played droll & deft, libretto bursting with life and everything you need to know about this production â there are charming costumes, cute acting and absolutely nothing is happening except verbal constructions. In general, not very memorable musical, which is made for the simple delight of your evening."
"124","Evil Dead ","    This musical of Canadian origin has the award â Dora Audience Choice Award, which it received in 2008. This is pretty popular non-classical play about zombies and other evil spirits, which crumbles on stuffing by a man with cropped hand, with fastened chainsaw to it. He did it with a hand himself. It is unlikely that such a musical people would like to see on Broadway, but it is entertaining, funny, and pretty tense â much better than half of Broadway shows., , Ontario took the first staging of this musical, in the framework of the local comedy club, if struggle with evil spirits might seem a comedy for someone. But, yes, with this background were filmed a lot of comedies, but the drama remains nevertheless a staunch ally of the genre, and of this particular play also. In 2003, full-fledged professional adaptation came out, coordinated with key producers â director of all movies of the franchise, Sam Raimi and the main actor, Bruce Campbell, depicting Ash. Sam Raimi â is a very big-name producer, director, actor, and writer. He did, in addition to these films, series about Hercules and Xena, their spin-offs and lots of continuations, and in general he worked on a huge variety of movies and TV series, where it is required to show the monsters and to do unusual make-up and to work-out storylines associated with non-existent animals or with the underworld., , Musical has not visited Broadway or the West End â not the format that can be perceived by their public. But it has well settled down in Las Vegas â the entertainment center of the world, which, after Dubai, is the jewel in many ways, also built in the desolate desert. It is like a magnet, attracts travelers from everywhere, so they left their money in many locations of entertainment of the city (and not only in casinos). And this musical, Evil Dead, starting from 2011, is the highlight of one of its cozy and sassy places, with an open date of ending and goes so far as, according to one of its producers, ""last fan will be covered with the blood on its 4D viewing""., , There is nothing unusual in the fact that musical is done on otherworldly topic. For example, the same Dracula or The Phantom of the Opera. But when they produce zombie-slasher, with rivers of blood and severed limbs (artificially, but still), with black humor and grim but attractive energy, albeit not as wild as in the movie ""A Cabin In The Woods"", but occurring in the same structure â it is far away from Broadway. But it is a ""bull's-eye"" when such a hellish inferno performed on the stages of Las Vegas. Viva Las Vegas! Viva el morte!"
"125","Evita ","    This musical is one of the most majestic creations by Andrew Lloyd Webber & his associate, Tim Rice. It describes briefly the aspiration of simple girl from Argentina to a political career, describing her since the age of 15 until the time of her death, indicating major milestones, through which she passed: the desire for fame and glory, the acquisition of political power, philanthropy, and death. At first, it was a rock opera, and some critics have not spoken positively about the show just because they were old farts who did not like rock at all. The original opening was in 1978, which was preceded by several years of study by Lloyd Webber. He was at that time in a trip in Argentina and learned about the second wife of a local warlord, who took over as president after the elimination of his rivals. She was a kind of spiritual national leader, which many people liked because of her charitable programs., , The musical has gathered collectively 16 awards and 22 nominations of the most prestigious awards. Based on the musical, it was even made a film in 1996 with the participation of Madonna and Antonio Banderas, and no less famous Ricky Martin played one of the leading male roles in the resurrection of production on Broadway in 2012., , Very strong work about a very strong woman who lived a bright and effective life, thanks to her internal aspirations, largely contributed to the fact that her husband became president of the country and has developed a wide range of activities, not only within Argentina but also promoting a policy of her husband in nearby countries. The songs of this musical (especially Donât Cry For Me, Argentina) became a part of the golden fund of works of Andrew Lloyd Webber, who is like a rock star in the world of musicals: he has 1 Oscar and 2 nominations for it, 1 Golden Globe and 1 nomination, 4 Grammys, 7 Tonies, 4 Olivier Awards & 3 nominations, and 21 other acknowledgements. There are such hit creations on account of him as Jesus Christ Superstar, Cats, The Phantom of the Opera, Sunset Boulevard, The Wizard of Oz and others. He is a very productive person, feeling theater very subtly and he is an author of many musicals, several of which were filmed or TV-adaptations were made., , Evita became his lodestar, after which went other works, even more remarkable by the number of exhibitions (the same Cats strive ahead in 2 times by count of shows on Broadway). To describe its atmosphere, you just must plunge into the darkness of the hall, where the creation of a mystery goes & to watch the passion invested in it by actors., , As to the subject of the musical â not a fictional story is ever better, as it allows to draw parallels between what the viewer is fed and what was actually in the real world. For example, Evita was not really such a saint, as she is depicted: she jumped out of bed to bed, struggling herself a star track; she created the charitable foundation, through which money were laundered; she, together with her husband, eliminated his political rivals in the physical and figurative senses of this word."
"126","Face the Music ","    The musical was written as a satire on politics, artificially inflated, and then collapsed economy (where from trying to earn anything and to survive, there were even such proposals as watching 4 movies in a row in a comfortable room with a toilet only for 10 cents). In addition, there is ridicule of the show business, which is highly unstable, like the rest of our life, does not produce anything and quickly falls off, and its participants â actors and producers â yesterday shone on the catwalk, now forced to languish for some measly cents unable to find a job. Among other things, it had enough space for the most high-profile event of that time â the Great Depression, from the thought of which business sharks all over the world still shudder., , Critics spoke highly of the quality of the musical, saying that its lyrics were ""delicious and sharp-tongued"", music was ""in the spirit of the time, clearly recreated the mood, hovering in the air"", the songs were ""smart and full of the biting satire for which we do go on musicals""., , This histrionics is a mixture of operetta, musical and burlesque show in which the main goal â to give the public exactly what all visit Broadway for â colorful costumes and good choreography, exciting story, empathy to protagonists and, above all, a good mood, without which every show turns into a big puff., , Some observers, however, noted some kind of artificiality as deus ex machina was added to the story in order to create the necessary happy ending, which was so requested by the public, especially in 1932. Later, however, this technique for a very few people seemed unnatural, because population of 1990s and so on have very accustomed to the strange turns of events and do not see ex machina even directly in front of them., , A distinctive feature of not only this musical, but also a whole period of early Hollywood is really a very beautiful singing. The leading female voice is incredibly alluring, shimmering with multiple colors. It is felt that the rehearsals took longer than streaming works of present times."
"127","Falsettoland ","    In addition to the fact that production was in the USA about American Jews, which is quite normal, musical was also depicted in Japan, where it has not been altered not for a jot by thence reality and perception. Therefore, for example, the network contains some reviews about Japanese production, where the dialogues and the appearance of actors look a bit discouraging. For example, when one of them entered, saying to all presents: ""you are so white"", which simply copied from the script, not fitting the context., , Another musical that being gay means taking a risk that you may have the AIDS disease. And so it happens â one of them gets sick and goes to the hospital, which, of course, unable to provide him any significant help. The other, his lover/friend is very concerned about this, but since can help with nothing, decides to arrange his Bar Mitzvah at the hospital. By the way, depending on the production, Bar Mitzvah should happen either to the boy's father, or for the boy himself â at least from the different production subjects it follows as is., , A kind of edification is present in the musical; it turns out, the ability to perform intercourses between gays is depicted as one that should be banned or casted in doubt, otherwise inevitable AIDS occurs. About other sexually transmitted diseases no one thinks, because the whole world fears most of this disease, and such condemnation for some reason on the side of gays goes more than on the side of drug addicted who are in fact the number one risk-group on the planet for this illness. Apart from this strange edification, the musical, though not a comedy, contains elements of humor coming from actors, not from the plot, thanks to the clear understanding of when to make a joke so the hall shook with laughter. It is thanks to this combination of humorous and seriousness, the musical distinguishes from most part of simply serious ones that try more to asleep their audience rather to cheer it up."
"128","Fame Becomes Me ","    Jokes and irony permeated the entire musical, which is a ""one-man show"", despite the fact that he was there with help of five other actors, including starring such first-class fames as Whoopi Goldberg, Chita Rivera and Billy Crystal, among others. What is different generally about this play comparing to many others who like to arrange a personal benefit? However, it is not just self-promotion, as funny action almost does not stop and there is also an irony, self-satire, parody, jokes, and the acuteness on the participants in the show business in a whole. In general, a beholder must be ""in the know"", having a pretty good indication of what is happening in the theater business and show business in its cinematic manifestation because there are parodies on such things as Jesus Christ Superstar. In a nutshell: if you have not seen it or never heard a record from it, you would hardly realize after all that it contained a parody. On the other hand, many visuals lie on the surface. In particular, when Martin Short states: ""I am going to tell a lot of stories from my life, most of which are based on a complete fiction. So let's start with the truth. I was born in 1976."" (Note â Martin Short was born in 1950 and his active work in showbiz started in 1972)., , So for what is worth to pay from 70 to 215 dollars for one ticket to his show? Firstly, for those who doubt â Martin Short really is keen in what is called âsharp-tongueâ and it is not for nothing that treads the stage. Apart from his active work, he is very well comedic actor. Remember vivid scene from the beginning of the film Â«Death Becomes HerÂ» (1992, Meryl Streep, Bruce Willis, Goldie Hawn and Isabella Rosellini), when the audience got up and went away from the musical show of Meryl Streep, who ineptly produced it, for the sake of clumsy self-promotion? Roughly the same thing, but exactly the opposite, can be seen here â spectators come not away but in to absorb the talent (and a giant charm of Martin Short), which oozes from the stage. By the way, it seems to us, Martin plays on a big contrast between this film, which also has a lot of humor, but black one and makes it really the other way around, polar, to receive light, bright and sparkling musical, on which you rest."
"129","Fame ","    This musical had so many different productions that it has phenomenal number of music recordings of its various manifestations. During the period 1993 â 2012, 19 different recordings were performed! In particular, they were from: Sweden, London, Spain, Poland, Australia, Denmark, Hungary, Broadway, Barcelona, Iceland, Porugaliya, Madrid, Hungary (remake), Thailand, South Korea, Brazil. Among the awards, it has 3 pieces of Laurence Olivier â for best musical, lead actress and choreography., , Source for the story served a film named the same, Fame, which was filmed in 1980 and musical premiered 8 years later, in Florida. The story of several students of music and dance school, which meet, acquaint, diverge into adulthood with all its charms and challenges. Someone begins to live together, someone starts taking illegal drugs and degrades due to this, and someone are disappointed that she and his boyfriend has different paths in life and they are departing in different colleges, planning to meet at a distance (which, as we all know, does not end with anything other than separation). These companies are mostly dancers, but there are actors, composers, songwriters, singers and other characters. The very histrionics is quite simple due to lack of plot, uncomplicated acting and the ability to make changes easily in the acting progress. You can even improvise. As a result of this versatility of musical, it is popular in various productions, especially the amateur., , This musical you can love at least for the fact that it does not have Zac Efron, which already tired all. Here we have completely intelligent, but not flamboyant, dialogues, cheerful, but not a puppy-cheered, songs and choreography, of course, is a cherry on the cake, as we are talking about the dancers in a special school, which has an emphasis on music and dance education, in addition, giving some academic knowledge too. There are its leaders and outsiders, and in general, it is full-of-youth-energy musical, which must be praised at least for the fact of its existence. It has with no exaggeration, furious energy and passion allowed it to play for decades (if you aggregate all its exhibitions all over the world) that are not just great, but even worthy of the Guinness Book of Records., , The song titled Canât Keep It Down, in which one of the leaders-participants states that he cannot physically restrain his little bold daredevil when he sees a beautiful girl, in the opinion of some critics, might seem a bit out of place due to age of the audience. But it is necessary to remember that some already have children at the age of 15 years, so there is nothing unusual in the fact that someone exhibits own physiology, not wanting to hide it (simply, the acting to the public, "
"130","Fanny ","    Walter Slezak, one of the leading actors of the original production in 1955, received a Tony â the only award which this performance was awarded with. Critics spoke of the high quality of the original play on Broadway, calling it ""a genuine and full of regrets and emotional empathy"", all of its component parts were designed surprisingly precisely, from the melodious music to the acting of members. As a result, on the basis of these definitions, we can conclude that the musical was released solidly, nothing to reproach here, and it is entirely within the quality that is expected from the average Broadwayâs musical. Based on it, the film was released in 1961, which has already lost the excessive bitterness that was in a musical, and was a mix of drama and comedy., , By the way, the musical is based on a series of similar works in the cycle and this is the only musical format among all. Film of 1931 (Marius) is a drama, followed by 1933âs Fanny and 1936âs Cesar â the cycle of three, consistently telling the story through acquaintance with various characters. The subsequent film of 1961 â is not a musical, but filmed in the form of a conventional narration. Apart from them (1931â1936âs were filmed in Italy), in 1934 one of Germanâs production went in run, drama, and in 1938 â the US comedy. Interesting coincidence: German film called ""Big whale"", and the name of the director of the 1938âs film was Whale. Subsequently, the rights were purchased on the adaptation by the founder of the Warner Brothers company, and he released it not in the form of a musical, because by the end of 1930's musicals have lost their popularity in the movies. Audrey Hepburn even wanted to star in the film, but then she declined due to a workload (eventually, actress of very high visual similarity to Audrey, appeared in a film adaptation of 1961 â Leslie Caron (now she is 84), born in a family of actors of Broadway). Film of 1961 was the most successful in the chain of productions â considering both musical and other genres, received 5 Oscars, 4 Golden Globes, and other 2 more awards (despite the rather modest box office of USD 4.5 million). The strong influence of the musical is felt in the film â music, without lyrics, remained in its accompaniment. The plot and everything else here does not ascribe, as musical itself was based on earlier works & it is their adaptation (on already mentioned movies of 1931 â 1936)., , The most notable achievement of 1954âs musical was, perhaps, acting, because stage design and costumes were quite average. Producers have made the right bet on all the actors, where the most remarkable among them was Florence Henderson (depicting Fanny), who is now 81. Her acting career began in 1954 with a small TV episode, till the current time she starred in 65 different roles; in the films she played in the period of 1970 â 2013, playing 13 roles; on stage she made her debut in 1949, acting until 1989 (40 years!), appearing in 13 different musicals. Quite productive, but not a famous actress, performing her job simply as a job, without a soul and a spark."
"131","Fantasticks","    In addition to its major productions, musical had such important ones: Washington (2009â2010), West End (2010, not successful, having negative feedback), and more than 60 locations worldwide (including Zimbabwe, Costa Rica, Afghanistan, Germany, Israel, Iran, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Japan & Australia), being translated into such languages: Thai, German, French, Pashto, Mandarin, Danish, Spanish, Hebrew, Hungarian, Finnish, Japanese, Irish, Icelandic, Czech, Dari, Norwegian, Italian, Swedish, Persian, Arabic & Slovak. It has shown fantastic 11.000 international shows, visiting more than 3000 (!) different cities on our globe, being demonstrated even in The White House. On the basis of it, the film was shot in 2000, albeit unsuccessfully â with a budget of USD 10 million, it has collected even less that USD 50 thousand. Simplified version of the musical of 1964 was released as a movie, but without the two characters, incorporating them into fathers of families., , Interesting fact â the antihero, to whom kidnapping of a daughter was trusted, used to describe their conceived action with word Â«rapeÂ». This, in the modern interpretation, is almost always been used means ""violating the integrity of genital organs by means of usage of physical power"", but in 1960, it was used as a classical understanding â âabduction, as person assignation in some place which is unrevealed to othersâ. In the process of long-term production of the play, the meaning has changed, and word form found a value distant from the original vocabulary meaning, in connection with which many young viewers, coming to play, complained after about this fact. But the use of this word has not been terminated, as a result, giving even a particular flair. However, for very receptive audience, the show was staged alternatively, reworked with lyrics and songs, where it was used and depicted in parallel to the main histrionics., , The show, apart from its technical performance and the enthusiasm after its duration, is a beautiful fairy tale of love of two, who as if anti-Romeo and Juliet. That is, they initially did not like each other, but, thanks to the efforts of their fathers, aimed on creating of visibility of enmity between the houses, they begin to approach each other and eventually obtained artificially created infatuation. Nevertheless, it turned something really big when it passed the test of time and separation, and the children realized that they are really in love, they desperately need each other. In general, it is quite normal swings doing that in one direction and then in the other several times, only to stop on the side of the ""happy ending""."
"132","Fiddler on the Roof ","    This musical has a lot of interesting stuff in technical indicators. First of all, it is among the top ten musicals on both main stages of the world, Broadway and West End, showing a huge number (3400+ and 2000+ respectively). That's not counting its resurrections. Apart from that, it possesses a bunch of awards and nominations: 1965 (Tony â 9 wins & 1 nomination); 1972 (Tony â 1 win); 1981 (Tony â 1 nomination); 1990 (Tony â 1 win & 1 nomination); 2004 (Tony â 6 nominations; Drama Desk â 3 nominations); 2008 (2 Laurence Olivier nominations). Taken together, they summarize 25 awards & nominations. To put it mildly, very not bad. The musical also visited various places in the international arena â Australia, Europe (Germany, Tokyo, Israel, France, Spain), Africa, both Americas etc., , Like many popular musicals, it has a lot of amateur productions. If we talk only about the reliably known and only in USA, there is information about 500+ shows. The film of 1971 became the biggest box office success of this year & was nominated at 8 Oscars, winning 3. It eventually became so popular that it has created own halo, from which, like the rays, came references to other areas of life, so it entered the pop-culture, becoming part of life and of elementary knowledge about the world. Even parodies were produced on it, that donât normally happens to musicals. Such eminent personalities as Howard Lovecraft in his work Shoggoth on the Roof parodied it. And a fantastically funny and lovely film Mrs. Doubtfire, where now gone from us Robin Williams performed one of his most prominent roles, parodied a Matchmaker character, which was among the characters of a village, wooing the eldest daughter of the milkman with the wealthy widowed butcher."
"133","Finding Neverland ","    Its creators did more than another variant of a fairy tale about Peter Pan, who battles with Captain Hook and discovers the wonders of Neverland, which became his home for a time while he remains a teenager. They showed a lively story through dramatic passage of events. Fairy tale, in which your dreams can turn true, if you are a child, heart-opened to the world and suddenly meet an honest and the same good-hearted adult who fully shares your aspirations and percepts the world with the same mischievous eyes. Who fell in love with your mother, replacing you recently deceased father, and who will take care of you after your mother's death caused by a sudden illness. A series of unfortunate events that united the characters, allow them to find a new family, even against the background of rejection by society in the face of his ex-wife and the mother of a dying woman. This all allows the writer to come up with the tale of Peter Pan, based on one of his top-beloved new people in his life â one of the quartet of children, after which he promised to take care of. Tearjerker plot about kind and brave fairytaleâs birth, in which reflected the reluctance to grow up as the red line, as a strong stance against imminent death, from which it is so much misery in this life in general and in the lives of our characters in particular., , The viewer is shown, how, caused by a surplus of emotions, the boys are flying across the stage that represents their room, because they are full of happiness. The same emotions allow Peter Pan to fly, as the main driving force. As soon as he thinks about something bad or sad, he immediately falls. This comparison is taken entirely from the life that soon-orphans enjoy socializing with their new dad, who not only make them feel joyful again, but also is able to comfort in difficult times, which catch the viewer closer to the end of the play. By the way, emptying bench, where two people had just sat â Peter and his new dad, after some seconds already showing only their silhouettes, and seconds later becoming empty at all, evidences clearly the lifecycle, which leads to inevitable death. ""We are only guests in this world"" â one of the philosophers said, and he was amazingly right., , Apart from a very complicated story that was artfully depicted in the film by first-class actors, a musical had noticeably weaker realization. For example, there are questions to its songs, including the song Neverland. Frankly speaking, in this form as it is, it misses a lot (if not completely all) things that require a high professional level from vocal performance. Just literally two sentences are sung as needed, with pauses, at the desired height, with lack of falseness (We can sail away tonightâ¦ line and so on). The rest is disappointing. Perhaps because of the low level of technique in the performance of the musical, it had not received any awards; neither was marked by serious duration."
"134","Finian's Rainbow ","    This musical possesses a list of awards. In 1947 â two Tony wins; 1948 â 1 Tony win; 1956 â 1 Tony nomination; 2010 â 3 Tony nominations, 7 Drama Desk wins & 1 nomination; 4 Outer Critics Circle nominations., , The same man who wrote the lyrics for The Wizard of Oz in 1939, E. Y. Harburg, bothered this time also on a new fabulous setting where there was a weaving magic, story of gold, leprechauns, said wishes immediately coming true, magic and love. The latter, however, many people do not apply to the magical sphere, while their opponents claim that there is nothing more magical than love exists., , If you think about it well, this musical would have to be rewritten. It requires complete elimination of all racist moments from it (when the greedy and stubborn Senator turns into black, it is a cruel punishment for him, and then he turns back white with visible relief), as well as all the socialist things coming from the USSRâs heritage, which are an eyesore for every sane person. For example, Senator might be converted into a toad or some animal-like monster, such as in The Beauty & The Beast. And then it would versatile in time. But now it belongs to the era of the 20th century, no step away. For this reason, its film adaptation was postponed from 1950, when America was in hysterics over communism and expectations of a nuclear strike, until 1968, when Broadway shed with rain of great demand for its musicals, many of which were then filmed, like this one. Despite such a big name as Francis Ford Coppola, directing it, motion picture came out pretty artsy and dully made, as if some final joinery work is plained with hatchet, not polished with a soft cloth. It was the first independent work of Mr. Coppola and, despite it paid off, formally opening the way for his further work, the critics did not like it at all. Coppola was often accused of impermissible political views, which were especially visible in his Apocalypse Now (1979), but thanks to his phenomenally successful films as The Godfather, The Great Gatsby, The Cotton Club, Bram Stocker's Dracula, as well as a giant influence on the film industry as a whole, he has huge forgiving., , The plot is made whether for teenagers who still believe in naive stories, or whether for quite ironically-minded adults who want to abandon the boredom of this world for a couple of hours and to plunge into the ridiculous story in which fairy-tale characters surprisingly organically mixed with personalities from the real universe. Leprechaun and gold, which an enterprising person steals and buries near the Fort Knox, in the hope that the aura of this place will allow gold to grow up becoming bigger. Conversion to other people with back reconversion. The presentation in a strange 'contemporary' style, which conceals the careless style of narration (Disney never abandons this style). It all becomes something like little evil social ironic story, amid confrontation of farmers with bad territorial government, represented by the greedy Senator. Mixed feelings are left after watching. On the one hand, you are plunged into a fairy tale, but on the other â you are completely captured by the attributes of this mortal world, like stealing, bright social inequality and racism."
"135","Fiorello ","    One of the previous mayors of the City of New York, a man named Fiorello LaGuardia, about who is told in this musical in general terms, describing how he came to power, becoming the mayor of city, promising to fight corruption, becoming a thorn in the back of criminals that ruled the city those times. He disdained their help, and won the elections on his own (not in the first time, true, but in the second attempt), then helping to clean the city from the evil mobsters to US president, for which he was famous as an honest politician., , Musical also introduces us naive, strikingly ridiculous looks of some women who advocate for the rights and views. For example, one of them offers to the future mayor to pass a law that would prescribe exactly how husbands should treat their wives (after the wedding, to provide them for a year of a honeymoon, so she had no worries, receiving only love and respect, and being indulging in everything etc.). In general, the desire is understandable, but the form of realization is strange and impossible in the real world. Not that it was impossible in principle (because in loving families in general, everything is like that), but you cannot force to love with a stick; in addition, there is no supervisory authority, which would carry out activities on monitoring the compliance with the implementation of this law. And even if we assume that it will be created, do you imagine its staffâs quantity? In the song I Love A Cop, one of the factory workers sings that she is in love with her class enemy â the police officer who took part in the dispersal of the demonstration. Lawless Heart., , The script incorporates secondary actors whose characters are elaborated largely at the expense of the main storyline, which tells us about mayor. Firstly, his successful activity in the Senate is not displayed almost no way that makes the viewer think that he is some kind of an outsider, not a successful legislator, who has decided to go up the career ladder. Secondly, his successâ progress is shown fragmentary, so it is difficult to make a complete picture in the head of his prominent ascending. Third, his success in 1933 seems rather convex, exaggerated, that adds no credibility to the musical., , The musical received such awards: Pulitzer Prize for best drama in 1960, 4 nominations on Tony & 3 victories. Critics were vied in the words of praise to this musical; it was infinitely loved by everyone. For example, such opinions sounded, that this musical has a great team, which could not be better in the sound or multifaceted actors play, the libretto and music, as well as the lyrics themselves were witty, accurate and imbued with humor so much, as if a sponge, which is full of absorbed water. It was quite a big hit of its time and minor issues didnât hurt (for example, that a mayorâs wife had died after 9 years of marriage, whereas in life â only after 3)."
"136","First Date ","    Who doesnât love a blind date? Of course, by this I mean, who does?, , I had one the other day, with the new Broadway musical âFirst Date.â Iâd heard little about the show, and its authors were entirely unknown to me., , Didnât go so well., , Does any of the following sound familiar? An instant lack of rapport; a growing aversion as the minutes pass; a mysterious sense that time has suddenly stopped; a desperate hope that the apocalypse will arrive, preferably right this minute. Magnify those feelings, set them to bland pop-rock music, and youâll have some idea of the oodles of fun I didnât have during my evening at âFirst Date,â the singing sitcom that opened on Thursday night at the Longacre Theater., , With a book by Austin Winsberg and a score by Alan Zachary and Michael Weiner, âFirst Dateâ depicts, in all-too-real time, the initial encounter between Aaron (the very winning Zachary Levi, of the series âChuckâ) and Casey (the big-voiced Krysta Rodriguez, of the little-lamented âSmashâ), two generically mismatched New Yorkers whoâve been set up by her sister., , Aaron, who arrives at the appointed watering hole first, overdressed in suit and tie and rippling with nerves, is the Nice Jewish Boy with a good job (âinvestment banking,â âcorporate finance,â âmergers and acquisitionsâ are all mentioned). Yet he has, apparently and none too plausibly, never before been on a blind date. Casey is his opposite, the Artsy Tough Chick whoâs all hard angles and wary experience, attired in a flashy leather-and-lace dress and mildly threatening ankle boots., , âSheâs kinda indie and pretty hot,â as Aaron sings, âand a lot like all the things that I am not.â, , Sheâs kinda familiar, too: the cool serial dater with a thing for bad boys. Aaron is also a recognizable type: the sweet, slightly nebbishy but cute guy whoâs had his heart kicked around. Groaningly obvious, too, is the antagonism that animates their getting-to-know-you banter, which is set to the mechanical rhythms of formulaic television comedies about single guys and gals on the loose and looking for love in the city., , After zigzagging between moments of bonding and alienating missteps (when Aaron learns that Caseyâs an old hand at this, he jokingly nicknames her âBlind Date Slutâ), these two all-wrong-for-each-other sorts begin to find common ground. Casey flares up in outraged sympathy upon hearing that Aaronâs fiancÃ©e dumped him at the altar â another minty-fresh twist â and by the eveningâs end, they have established a tentative rapport, just in time for the curtain to fall on a passionate smooch. (Sorry, but no, thatâs not a spoiler.), , Annotating the coupleâs predictably rocky path to love, or at least a second date, are voices in their heads. Aaron is haunted by memories of his emasculating ex (Kate Loprest) and upbraided by his best buddy (Bryce Ryness) whenever he makes a rookie mistake, like bringing up the emasculating ex. Caseyâs primary noodge is her sister, Lauren (Sara Chase), who pesters her about her ticking biological clock and her tendency to withdraw, then scolds Casey when she has the scandalous thought of ordering a burger, lamenting that sheâll âend up on âThe Biggest Loser â âGee, I Wonder Why Iâm Still Singleâ Edition.â â (Aaron, meanwhile, gets an earful from his buddy when he ponders ordering a âsissy salad.â), , Casey also hears frequently â or rather we do â from her Gay Best Friend (Kristoffer Cusick), who rings her cellphone to give her a chance to âbail out.â Although the character is a noxious stereotype (his parting terms of endearment are âbitchâ and âslutâ), this song has a certain snazzy comic verve and is among the musicalâs rare moments that approach originality. But then the Gay Best Friend comes back a second time, and a third, singing reprises of the same damn song, and your nerves start to fray., , Mine were in tatters long before he came flouncing onstage for the last time, having been shredded by the comic banality of most of the material. When Aaron discovers that Caseyâs not Jewish, the supporting cast leaps into action, dressed in Orthodox costume, representing Aaronâs scandalized family. (Chorus: âThis isnât the girl for you â oy oy oy! This isnât the girl for you â a goy goy goy!â), , When âFirst Dateâ tries to be serious, itâs no more inspired. Caseyâs big, soul-baring number, âSafer,â brings us the unsurprising news that her tendency to shut down viable relationships stems from a fear of getting hurt. âI go building up walls, yet I wish to be found,â she plaintively sings., , And I wish to be anesthetized, Casey, particularly if you keep going on about Eckhart Tolle and âThe Power of Now.â, , I have been harsh on this modest musical, efficiently if facelessly directed by Bill Berry, so I should underscore that Mr. Levi and Ms. Rodriguez are both appealing performers. Although his singing is merely adequate, Mr. Levi brings a vitality and off-kilter humor to his performance and succeeds in rubbing away some of Aaronâs more generic qualities with his warmly quirky line readings. Ms. Rodriguez has the drearier role â itâs obvious that the show was written by three guys, since only the female characters are accessorized with flaws â but her singing is ardent and assured., , I also feel honor-bound to report that the audience at the performance I attended seemed to respond with genuine warmth. In fact, they were a virtual live laugh track, erupting with gusts of guffaws at each worn joke or familiar torque in the give-and-take between Aaron and Casey., , But even those who can never get their fill of dating-game gags would have to admit that the singles-searching-for-love thing was a lot fresher back in the 1990s, when âFriends,â âSeinfeldâ and âSex and the City,â along with their lesser ilk, began digging around this terrain. By now itâs been thoroughly strip-mined and needs to be reinvented, not just rehashed and set to mediocre music. A more appropriate title for âFirst Dateâ would be âLast Rites.â, , "
"137","Five Course Love ","    Have you ever been on a blind date? On a very unfortunate date, in the restaurant, where they make a barbecue and your meeting is just the same â fried-out. Or have you ever asked a hand & a heart of the lady, standing at one knee in a restaurant where all the views of surrounding people addressed to you? Only to get a loud failure and to be completely humiliated? Are you familiar with such a date, where everything that could go wrong, goes this way? Then meet this exciting comedy, which undergoes within the framework of off-Broadway line in the New Century Theatre, where for a reasonable price of about USD 25 you can observe as 3 actors depict 15 different roles. They are looking for happiness and play a very motley characters, from the wife of a gangster, that does hanky-panky twirling behind his back, to the dominatrix, with her servant (if to say about female roles). Men's roles are represented here with a broad spectrum â from insecure loser-botany, to husky cowboy, with irrepressible vitality., , On the one hand, this is a cute sitcom and vaudeville. Scenes are separated by 15 minutes each, during which goes one main storyline about love expectations and achievements. On the other hand, of course, it's not high art, so only 70 plays in 2005 confirm this. Yes, scenes are revealed comical and even ridiculous. But the absurdity and slapstick to all events added with the characters that are very exaggerated in acting, as if playing a standup show, not on-stage musical. They often possess highly expressive facial looks and movements of the limbs, which would be best in amateur theater, not in professional. Yet, according to most critics, this musical is a rather cute prank than a serious work, so about it the same cute and playful comments were said, such as ""musical is a stunning breakneck, it has sparkling humorousness, flamboyant vitality, it is amusingly pastiche, heartwarming and tunefulâ. As you have seen, it is characterized by a variety of adjectives that are in very ambiguous terms describe the enthusiastic admiration, without noting specific points that outline exactly what beholder may experience., , Its director, Gregg Coffin, wrote also music & lyrics and book for this work and directed it, so he basically handed a bigger half in this production. Low budget, highly-admired show for those who do not consider themselves connoisseurs of fine cohort that enjoy colorful transmission of the emotional range on the stage, but who need very visualized humor with broad strokes of its paint to feel happily and to plunge into gaiety., , Without having to pretend the high art, this comedy is a good sitcom, where emotions are served rather glaringly painted, and clothes are parody of the everydayâs dressing-up of characters just to clearly emphasize the features of their owners. This piece proves that the scene is too high for such things and TV format should fit better."
"138","Five Guys Named Moe ","    In addition to the main places like West End & Broadway, this musical was also shown in Chicago. We may assume that it is not as big as Tony or Olivier, but Joseph Jeffersonâs Award is also an opportunity to celebrate its achievements, especially when it was nominated on it twice. It is a pity that a musical received none of these awards., , It was renewed in 2010 in Edinburgh and its subsequent resurrection in 2014/2015 were the re-done visions that staged also in Cleveland. Especially in the latter format, the main character was transferred from the 20th century to 21st, as well as a rethinking of arrangements of tunes were executed., , For all the time, production was marked with such musical awards: Laurence Olivier Award (1991) â 2 nominations and 2 victories; Tony Award (1992) â 2 nominations., , The juice of this musical is in the unity of performance of songs by its main actors â musicians. They are the protagonists â all of them carry same name Moe, as the musical is named after, although in the course of the story, they give different advices to a certain loser who drinks a lot, considering him a main part from the start. Incidentally, it is because of his indecision and the fact that he nothing really is, his girl abandoned him for good. This sad event he meets with a bottle once again. Some tiny thimbleful of magic adds and, as if by a magic wand, in front of him there are five musicians who are beginning to comfort and advise him, through the play on their musical instruments â flugelhorn, clarinet, saxophone, piano, drums, trombone, trumpet & bass. What is more remarkable in the production of this musical â Louis Jordan wrote for it a significant part of compositions. This person is now almost unknown, but he is the one who can be considered as the founder of the rock'n'roll genre, which was so explosively popularized by Elvis and other, less famous singers. Louis Jordan wrote the music, going away from the very popular classic jazz in 1940s â 1950s. Jazz as a genre rather tired everyone, with its eternal companion, blues that dragged the whole world into melancholic mood. So at the crossroads of mid-century, rock'n'roll starts in 1950â1960, and then in the 1970s and after â rock, the starting point for the explosion of which was not known to anyone especially before, a small town named Woodstock. Now, it is completely stuffed with museums of rock glory and is a place of pilgrimage, turning from a village., , Libretto disappears almost completely in the second part of the histrionics where musicians generally do only playing. Interestingly that leaving the auditorium, you really cannot remember even a single melody sounded from there, because they create a common halo of sound that stays with you as a light veil over several days, completely blurring its internal structure., , The very core that saves this musical with a weak libretto is the unity of musical band, where the general mood fully depends on the skills of each participant."
"139","Flora The Red Menace ","    Despite the fact that Liza Minnelli won in 1965 a record Tony award (as the youngest actress or actor, who received this on Broadway in 19 years), the musical was closed pretty soon. Critics among other reasons mentioned such impression that this play was not very organically composed together from pieces, resulting in a complete picture could not be caught at all, and everything else was playing without the necessary spark. But the work of miss Minnelli was praised even than and critics had no doubts that she would become a great singer in the future, which had happened., , One of the most productive people of our time, George Abbott, wrote the libretto for the musical in collaboration with R. Russell. J. Kander released music, F. Ebb worked on lyrics. Interestingly, this work has been a debut for Liza Minnelli, but still she received this most prestigious award. Ebb & Kander later made such big hits as Chicago together (later also phenomenally successful filmed), and Cabaret, where the star was the same Minnelli (and the song from which, New York, New York, was popularized by Frank Sinatra, who first heard it in this musical & he wildly loved how it was sung by Liza). As next two musicals by mentioned authors, this work also was different with such main features: a strong female leading personality and a lot of political content., , What could not please the public of Broadway â the set of unusual, alien to USA red communism ideology (also reflected in the title of the musical). Foreign always causes down and rejection. At least, the audience, and even readers often vote against even very good works, if they contain communism. For example, socialism â ""pure"" capitalist version of kooky communistic doctrine is thriving in many advanced countries, Sweden, for example. But in the wake of crisis of the early 1930s, it was oh so much not profitable to be the bearer of such views, the same as in any other time. , , Perhaps the creators took into account their past mistakes and in the same Chicago they made clean politics, fully in motion vector of views of theatergoers from Broadway. So Chicago musical lasted as long as it is generally thinkable for a musical (began in 1976, it is still on the run, so far toured in the overwhelming majority of countries of the world and giving almost 7500 performances only on Broadway)., , In general, you cannot blame any of its producers for the fact that this musical ""did not go"". Because the actors were chosen wisely, the libretto and the music were written with wit, and the voices were very deep and professional. On the other hand, there was no entourage that would actually dip us in those years. There were such flaws: the bricks in the walls looked new-minted, all the actors were dressed ""brand-new"", the abode of the main actress was bohemian and jobs were falling on her just on their own, from the sky, without leaving her any need nor space for internal development."
"140","Flower Drum Song ","    This musical is a creation of the creative duo of Rodgers & Hammerstein (the latter died in the early 1960s, and the first â in 1979). Richard Charles Rodgers was the first who had all four top awards in show business â Oscar, Emmy, Tony and Grammy (now there are only 12 people alike, some of whom are: Audrey Hepburn, Mel Brooks, Whoopi Goldberg, Scott Rudin, and others). As he also has Pulitzer Prize, it has made him an outstanding person, as the owner of all five, except of him, was only one person in the world â Marvin Hamlisch (received this award in collaboration with Rodgers for the musical A Chorus Line. He died in 2012). Hamlisch, by the way, here surpassed Rodgers, as he also had 2 Golden Globes., , What to expect from such a phenomenally talented duo? Only a very strong production. However, it should be fairly noted that this work is still considered the most unsuccessful among their collaboration, although the show did total of 1000 performances on both main scenes of the world â Broadway and West End. As for other productions, the main considered two versions â of 1958â1960 years and resurrection in 2002. The other significant ones were: 1961 in San Diego, in 1961 & 1965 in St. Louis, 1963 & 1964 in San Francisco, 1993 in Oakland (cutted version), 1996 in San Mateo (also cutted version), 2002 Broadway, where it was decided to revive the work of Hammerstein and Rodgers. The libretto of this had to be revised because some things have changed for 40+ years and have become politically incorrect, as well as musical contained outdated views on things that simply ceased to be relevant in today's world. From it anti-feminist things also were removed and the 2002 version is presented here in the section ""Synopsis"", whereas the 1958 version was generally more rude., , Heirs of Rodgers all agreed on the need to rework, while his widowed wife refused, but in 1997 author of the novel â C. Y. Lee â also agreed. Two authors were involved in work â one experienced and one novice, who brought contest between two worlds in a musical â the old and new, in the face of an old Chinese theater, which has lost prior popularity and a nightclub, which was rapidly gaining in fame. Just as the opposition of two types of people claiming rights on this musical â young heirs, opened to change and the old guard, which does not accept the changes at all. The musical was also greatly exaggerated in toughness to immigrants from Asia to settle in the United States., , After three years of reworking, the musical was staged in Los Angeles, where collected the necessary amount of funds for Broadway. After opening, the show received very enthusiastic reviews from critics and was continued several times after the planned date of the closing, eventually did so only 2 years later in LA. It moved on Broadway in 2002, closing after only 169 hits. Its producers have lost all their investments, due to the negative reviews about the musical and the small attendance."
"141","Floyd Collins ","    Show is interesting with its stage design â rocks, caves, tunnelsâ¦ However, the tunnels were an exaggeration. It is not true in displaying uninhabited caves, as tunnels can go along with the subway or train, or if there is some serious mining, at least. Therefore, tunnels on the scene are rather visual entertainment than displaying a possible reality., , Imagine â you are a caver. And you fall in cave in the crack and you cannot get out in any way. What range of emotions you will experience? Starting from the desire to fight for the integrity, and then, for life in general, to despondency and renunciation, and then waiting for the inevitable death, when you know that no one will be able to help. Just about the same happens to our hero who is experiencing mental anguish, when thinking about that, and whether it was worth to enter this cave, which would not repay him with wealth and fame as he dreamed, but will even take his life., , Music in general leaves rather disturbing and unpleasant sensation. Of course, it is designed in such a way to display the experience of the main character. And shows the same frustration that creeps up on him with each new heartbeat. As it was contemporary theater, you shouldnât expect much from this histrionics. But it was indeed very strong in regard to the display of the emotional spectrum of a man caught in a natural trap from which he will not get out (he doesnât know this yet). Jazz & soul & music, which is natural for the countryside, where country is the most widespread sounding. Instead of cheerful music and long, lingering notes that forms the elation, everything here is for sadness and gloom. Maybe that's because the audience did not find any love story, or humor, or no happy ending in this musical, it did not become popular? Quite possibly., , On the other hand, of course, it does have its original plot and interesting delivery and it dares to show unpopular things. There is reflection about the American dream, which pushes people to enterprise, sometimes ending fatally., , The tiny band of 5 people and worthy singers, together with an active music producer make this amazing contemporary thing. The energy on stage is formed well, and the voltage pulses. The audience hopes that the main character will be eventually saved. In terms of the story, here it is quite walking between worlds â the inner world of the hero and the world of real events. Despite the fact that when salvation of man goes, the account is on hours or days, but periodically the element of urgency drops and it isnât clear â whether it was the fault of the director or the librettist, or actors."
"142","Follies ","    Critics have many opinions about the various productions of this musical. For example, when talking about its original on Broadway in 1971, it was a financial failure, but the plot was exciting, so over time is became a classic. The failure of that was because of actors living in different worlds â in the ghostly & human, so not always the audience understood which one is displayed currently at any given time. If we talk about a completely redesigned staging in New York in 1995 (which was played about in the same form as the reworked version of 1989 in the West End), a striking difference in perception becomes evident. Here, critics said that the show deserved a standing ovation, and a level of one was good enough to wait (for such a good play) for many years. It was a lot of burlesque that fans of Sondheim loved. Although some questioned whether the processing of the libretto adequately reflected the ambiance of the original work of Sondheim, the premiere evening was truly fantastic. On the other hand, The Times were not in great admiration, and said that the musical was a decent idea, not overgrown into incarnation of a nice story. At the same time, all praised the joint work of Oscar Hammerstein II and Sondheim, who created a delicious masterpiece of music, which fully reflects the surroundings of recent years Broadway with its nervous and ironic musicals, making this production still gentle and lyrical, thanks to numerous inclusions of hope for subtle love, which especially finely transmitted by aged characters. They are able to do it without that fervor that is inherent to youth, thinking about each step and giving these shades, which give birth to the magic of the evening., , Almost every play of this musical on small sites collected a full hall and tickets were always impossible to get. The show closed on small locations because of the fact that the actors were paid very little and show extension threatened with the revision of the financial conditions. Large hallâs occupancy has not always had necessary filling to maintain its payback even at a zero level of ROI â about 70% of the seats. On various unsuccessful productions, critics spoke these lines: the Follies was a dramaturgical failure but a spectacular show, incompatible with long duration. Musical ""delivered only half of happiness to the audience"", someone fell in love with it already in the first act, and others have disliked it. In general, criticism evaluated every new version of production of the show very polar, which did not prevent it to be reborn again and again, as Phoenix from the ashes., , The list of awards delights: 1971 (7 Drama Desk Awards and 1 Drama Critics' Circle win), 1972 (4 Tonies nominations & 7 wins), 1987 (1 win & 1 nomination for Laurence Olivier Award), 2001 (3 Drama Desk nominations and 5 Tonies nominations), 2012 (7 Tonies nominations and 1 win, 7 Drama Desk nominations and 3 wins; 1 Grammy nomination)."
"143","Footloose ","    This show gave several tours in the UK, although many musicals were limited to only 1 or 2. There were as many as 3, and then a 10-year-old anniversary, the jubilee US tour was given (the composition of actors was following: J. Blim, E. Keiser, K. Proctor, L. Luppino, S. C. Barnes, G. Wall, M .âE. Hilton, J. Hollander, M. K. Guy, M. Kennan). The show plays with periodic renewals. For example, in 2015, Pennsylvania has taken one of the last productions in chronological order. Histrionics excelled with 4 Tony nominations in the categories: Best Book, Best Original Score, Best Performance, Best Choreography (although it never won any)., , This musical is based on a very popular movie of year 1984, starring Kevin Bacon (Tremors, Invisible Man among others), that has collected USD 80 million, despite the very mixed reviews. T. Snow was the author of the music, D. Pitchford did the lyrics, W. Bobbie was the author of the libretto in collaboration with D. Pitchford., , Dramatic history tells of a teenager who was forced with his mother to move to a small town from the big city, because they had no money to pay for an apartment there. So they stayed at relativesâ. The local priest in this city lost his baby in a car accident when he was returning from the dance and he made the wrong conclusions out of this situation. So he banned dancing (question mark â is any person really possess such an authority to do that? Besides, although these circumstances did not become the culprit of his death, as much as both traffic and weather conditions, along with the human factor of the driver. So, it would be much more logical to ban cars, roads or drivers. Or death itself). New arrivals in front of this prohibition, is very fond of dancing, and much distressed when on arrival find out about this strange forbiddance. After several stages of the fight, he was armed with a Bible, returning the priestâs weapon against him own: the attributes of faith contrary to the Nature of the faith itself. In the end everything is permitted amicably â the priest sees that dancing â not always evil and allows it again, to the delight of the huge cohort of local youth., , The film, which was the basis for the musical, received mixed reviews â it was just over 50% on Rotten Tomatoes, with the general conclusion about the musical: there was little dance, but everything else would look nice, if not incomprehensible fight of thugs with local authorities as a way to stand out and to make themselves unique. Although there is no bright line of love, it felt that a musical was liked by youth because of its rebellious spirit. Beautiful presentation of this position â dancing as a protest â captivated movie audience and allowed it to collect 80 million. Critics said that all the major storylines both in the film and in the musical, were displayed blurry â the conflict in the city, displaying colorless characters of teenagers and faded musical numbers. Even worse were such feedbacks as: despite being a hit, this was an empty garbage feed for teen market. The entire film only was holding on the charm of Bacon (in particular, all without exception, liked his multi-level dance at the mill), but he was not among members of this musical, and it is a pitiful."
"144","Forbidden Broadway Goes to Rehab ","    Once conceived as the last part of this phantasmagoria of already 21 parts (as of 2008 there were 18 parts), Forbidden Broadway is a very long-playing record. It entertains the user in bright colors, telling of what is now fashionable on Broadway and beyond its boundaries. Moreover, doing so in a very humorous form, as a parody of trendy things. For this reason, this histrionics has not have expressed separate plot, just musical sketches, cheered by music, with the numbers that are done by fairly provocative actors., , In 2008, this part of the show was conceived as the latest in a series of works of this author, but after it came out 3 more parts and this is unlikely to be the final stop., , One reviewer wrote that people who have health problems â in particular, have heart disease, are best to improve their health or to restrain from visiting this spectacle. Why? Because they can tear their bellies from laughter in the hall and to die. Not the most unpleasant death, agree, but still go visit your doctor before planning to become a beholder to this 18th part of the performance., , How about the show the actors spoke, they are Broadway narcomaniacs, and therefore try to explain all things, even the most serious, in ridiculous form that the public had fun. Otherwise, if you go for some serious performance, for example, telling of the struggle, war, unrequited love, civil war or confrontation for civil rights, you have the chance to die of boredom. Here it will be much less pleasant death than from laughter. It is because of this positive surroundings that create the show for 32 years in total with its 21 versions, it has given around the world in more than 200 places, for more than 9000 exhibitions, entering into many records both in terms of duration, and the number of people in the audience that smile."
"145","Forbidden Broadway, Vols. 1-4 ","    These are the first four collections of music from show (after years, theyâve been collected in one box), which began as off-Broadway in 1982 and lasted till November 2014 (not continuously, but with interruptions), noted in 2014 its 32nd anniversary. Some of people and even Wikipedia consider it not as pure Off-Broadway, but Off-Off-Broadway (well, at least, some of its parts). However, such an unusual title had no effect on its content â show tells all about the same â it is a parody of Broadway musicals, West End, off-Broadway shows, music, movies, famous people, and TV broadcasts. Somewhat Overindulgent song is a strange combination of impressive human in size and high, gentle voice, accompanied by playing the piano with such fingering of keys, as if it was a harp. Chita-Rita song â flows with Hispanics emphasis on fun by a girl trying to depict Spaniard, but in appearance, she is not. Here performed a parody of both Chita Rivera and Rita Moreno. Other scenes include a parody of The Phantom Of The Opera, and the song Be Depressed â pretty life-affirming thing, with deliberate accent of the English-speaking person, who pretends not to know English (for that, he has too good average American pronunciation) â listeners meet parody here on various entertainment tunes (by the way, the accent at the end of the song completely disappears)., , Admirers of these Off-Broadway shows can buy this collection of four disks, saving on every single part. This show is a kind of phenomenon â the only one of these that parodies other shows, staging for 12 years at the time of the release of this volumes. Number of shows at the time of writing this remark crossed 34 years, and Gerard Alessandrini, its creator, is, with no exaggeration, the all-in-one creator of this show â he had an idea, wrote it, elaborated, brought to life on stage, choreographed, and also played in it, directed, and then has been rewriting it approximately one and half times each year during its first 12 years to ensure that the public each time receive full freshness., , In total, the collection, among others, was a parody of such: Forrest Gump, Casablanca, The Wizard of Oz, Pulp Fiction, Aladdin, The Phantom Of The Opera, Evita, Annie, Amadeus, Grand Hotel, Kiss of the Spider Woman, as well as on the well-known personalities in the world of Broadway: Ethel Merman, Carol Channing, Madonna, Sondheim, Michael Crawford, Dustin Hoffman., , The show originally went for 2.5 years before the first closure, and given within this period 2330+ exhibitions. In total, at the time of this writing, it has been performed for more than 9000 shows and the quantity of visited locations of more than 200 cities & towns across the United Statesâ territory and several other countries. Particularly popular the show was in the United States because Broadway runs are mostly familiar to American public."
"146","Forever Plaid ","    In a conventional musical, there should definitely be following 4 things: the story (which is characterized by the plot, according to the libretto), songs, dances and stage play of actors. If any element falls out of this, or almost not represented in a particular scenic production, it is not considered a musical at all. Various labels hanged on it â revue, dance show and so on â depending on particular failing item. This one drops narrative part (libretto), so this work is a revue., , As for the plot, it, unlike other revues, where the entire narration takes place through a series of songs, has some free conversations. Four old friends, met in college, form a musical band with gentle and slow songs in the genres of blues and soft jazz. They try to break onto the top of the popularity in America of 1950sâ1960s. Who does not know â this period was the time of maximum flowering of such bands, and all worked strictly in these genres. Those areas that are perfectly natural-looking now â pop, rock & metal, were then completely underground creations of several much too free-minded people. Drastic changes began to take place only in the 1960sâ1970s, and finally formed closer to the beginning of the new millennium, up to 2000s., , This quartet rides in their Cadillac and large school bus, carrying several dozen Catholic girls, suddenly bumps into them and passes like a plow on harrow. Four falls in Purgatory, but for some obscure esoteric reasons, cannot go anywhere and forced to return to the sinful Earth, to give their biggest concerto. Then their life ways can be considered completed. In this case, the viewer does not imposed with any metaphysical values such as God, angels, demons, and the like â this part is completely, tactfully, missed. Everything else that happens on stage â only songs that very rarely mixed with a couple of talks to link one song to another. The talkative part is completely located on the narrator. , , Wondering how it can be an interesting show, where 4 men in white costumes performing songs from the long-gone 1960s, you're unlikely to find some tangible explanation other than the answer to a question: it is really interesting. At least one of the first real explanations that comes to mind â a variety of musical genres, in which this short action of just 90 minutes, is done. The second thing that fall onto memory is an amazing entertainment component of the event. Actors give jokes and funny movements, singing with horrible Spanish accent, make very fast songs, words of which are barely distinguished, use fun tips on microphones, look ridiculous, amusing, serious and, in general, have a good time on stage, giving us what is called âan entertainmentâ â a staple of show business."
"147","Fosse ","    This musical is a tribute to Bob Fosse for his contribution to the world of Broadway. This man participated in 6 films as an actor, 8 as a choreographer, in 1 as a dancer, in 5 as a director and in 2 as a writer. As for his participation in the life of musical theater, he put his hand to as many as 20 musicals: in 6 he was dancer/actor, in the other as a choreographer and a variety of them as a director, and even more â as the author of the libretto in several. His most outstanding works were Damn Yankees, New Girl In Town, Dancin' and Chicago (in this production of 1975, he has revealed himself as a director, the author of the libretto & choreographer). Chicago came out not only his most successful work, but one of the whale-hit of Broadwayâs show business in general. Based on it, was filmed not less successful motion picture with top Hollywood stars., , Primarily black-and-white clothing are used in musical, and an important element of the vast majority of images are hats that simplify visual row, not loading it with excessive colors (after all, there are as many as 27 dance numbers, which is more than enough for the visual load of the viewer)., , Critics spoke of the show in this direction: the spirit of Bob Fosse is clearly guessed, in many movements and expressionism of the show that in some strange way, in spite of the myriads of dances, not highly impressive and does not suppress with its majestic. However, several pairs hit from the very beginning, when the first dance of the 1st act reveals seething hormones expressed by the overwhelming strength of the scenic collaboration. Fosse, along with his co-worker on the dance Carol Haney in '53 made a very vivid dance, which stylistically repeated in the first opening sequence by L. Sakakura with A. Blankenbuehler â leading pair of mega-professional dancers. It seems that half of all the emotions of this revue were embedded in the first 45 seconds of this piece, daring, sensual, soulful, where almost physical proximity of Fosse felt pulsating as if he wants to get out, jump out of film tape directly onto the stage., , The musical has received three Tony Awards in 1999 as Best Musical, among others, and has received 5 more nominations. In the same year, it won 1 Drama Desk Award (for Outstanding Musical Revue) and received 2 more nominations on named award. For the London production, it was awarded with the Laurence Olivier, winning one for best choreography and receiving 2 more nominations, but not receiving conferment for Best Musical., , On the stage, as much as 30 talented dancers create black-and-white magic singly and in groups, sometimes of almost all its members. Together they show the surprised public the most stunning numbers of Fosse, including arbitrary copying of some wonderful dances of the films on which Fosse have worked. In 1973, he was an exceptional person, first amongst all was awarded with three most prestigious awards: Tony, Oscar and Emmy. All three in one year! Of course, doers began to appear afterwards, which collected 4 and even 5 most prestigious awards in one hands (Grammy and Pulitzer complementing the mentioned), but he was on top of list., , Reinking, his companion until the death, received Tony in 1997 for a very loud musical Chicago made in conjunction with Fosse, participated in the creation of this very staging. Also, G. Verdon, four-time Tony winner and his past wife, was associated with the creation of this brilliant show, as a consultant."
"148","Frankenstein A New Musical ","    The Modern Prometheus â this title gave Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley to book back in 1818, not knowing that her work would become such a hit that the monster of Victor Frankenstein will be even in cartoons for the youngest and as children's toys â that is, will become an integral part of the worldâs culture with which people get familiar with from the very childhood. And which is confused with the creator himself, named Frankenstein, in spite of the fact that this is the name of creator, not a beast. Prometheus is because Victor was its creator, and a god Prometheus was the creator of all Mankind, according to Greek mythology., , This musical, despite the fact that the very essence of the story is familiar to all, and films and animated works come punctually on the screens with this monster, has not found popularity and each version kept up to 2 months without giving even a hundred hits on stage. There may be a few explanations for that. First â unconvincing performance. Where a crazy doctorâs creature looks just like an ordinary person, in some cases even as a tramp, besides not having good artistry. In addition, he has always played in the same colors and, despite the plot twists and turns, his inner world and fickle emotions did not find the desired display, which should led to believe that he, though being really a monster, not a simple one, but driven by strong emotions and despite his  terrifying appearance and strength, was in fact, frightened and angry child. But this feeling beholder didnât have. The second explanation logically outcomes from the first â the creators of the various versions of Frankenstein made the beast to be a protagonist, but it does not always bring success to such works (spectacular, but totally morose âI, Frankensteinâ of 2014, hardly paid off in a box office, but USD 6 millions of gross income â is the lack of practical net income and negative result somewhere in 10 million, as part of the fees stay with a plurality of rolling intermediaries). The most common options become popular that are either depict the plot in the comedy genre (Hotel Transylvania 1 and 2, where such a character is present among mains), or focus on a tragic component of Victor himself, not his monster (However, âVictor Frankensteinâ of 2016 doing the mentioned focus, failed at all, bringing USD 6 millions of gross losses. But, perhaps it is not connected as much with the plot itself, as much with a presence of Daniel Radcliffe in the film â the vast majority of his films except Harry Potterâs franchise, consistently fail at the box office)., , Starting from pretty big idea, the creators of this play simply slipped into some weak storytelling, which is slimpsy in small things â costumes, lighting, and the most important ones â acting, for example. The viewer does not have enough right, deep emotions, which in the majority of the songs arenât smelled. In such a lovely style, which has been selected for such a gloomy story, should rather be the tale of Rapunzel told with her long blond hair, not about the monster, which is bursting with fear, anger and desire for revenge, nor about its creator, who loses his favorite wife from hands of the terrible beast, and then, through a perverted logic, must recognize it as his son."
"149","Frogs","    William Shakespeare and George Bernard Shaw are competing in their writing talents to be able to be resurrected in the world of the living through Dionysus, who wants to significantly improve the dramatic quality in the world, and because of that goes down for someone outstanding in the world of the dead, to visit Hades (Pluto)., , A strange combination of earthiness frogs and talks about the gods, Hades, Zeus and Dionysus, among others. A good British accent, excellent diction, a clear, jerky music â everything is woven so as to deceive the viewer, as they may expect that this will be a concerto in the swamp, among the moss and mosquitoes, where the arguments will be reduced to the mundane things, like in Cats (also animals; also 4 letters in the title). But in fact, everything is far not so. Very interesting and entertaining comedy story that masterfully made by Stephen Sondheim (some might consider that it was the style of Andrew Lloyd Webber)., , Invocation And Instructions â very humorous appeal in verse to the public that one should not do during the performance (do not crunch their candy wrappers of sweets, do not spoil the air â its already too few, do not wait to visit the restroom till the middle of the show, especially if you are in the middle of a row, turn off mobiles, no snorting, no asking what just happened, no hooting and many other different donâts). It is served as a part of the play and also as welcoming remark, very bright and a bit insulting, as if it is an appeal to the uncultured public (in fact it turns out that most of the public is still uncultured, as in the hall for 1000 seats still here and there will be heard, at least, some phone rings during the play). In about the same vein, all other musical numbers â with grandiose music, wonderful costumes, frivolous fitting on body of actors, tailored so believable, that at times it seems that these are really big frogs., , Although the first adaptation was for musical in 1941, costumes of 2004âs Broadway we like much more. Generally, a mixture of this tailless amphibians and serious things like Greek gods, which was originally written by Aristophanes, between 446 and 386 years B.C., is a comedy (of 30 famous works in tragicomedy genre of mentioned writer, only 11 reached our times and this was amongst them). And the way how it is served in the modern theater, worthy of admiration. Stephen does not do a bad job and free interpretation of this comedy of 2400 years old is a proof of that., , Initially, production was made at Yale University, as the final work of a student (he wrote this adaptation of the ancient comedy). Frogs had to swim around the boat, in which were two â of the underworldâs Styxâs River conductor and Dionysus, god of wine and revelry. It turned out funny and Sondheim made history with a very high-profile stars (at the opening) â Sigourney Weaver and Meryl Streep, although the acoustics of the hall he didnât like so much that he even compared it with the sound of the urinal."
"150","Full Monty","    This production was noted by only a few awards, but multiple nominations. So, among them: Tony (2001, 10 nominations, 0 awards), Drama Desk (2001, 11 nominations, 1 win), Theatre World Award (1 win)., , In the picture, there are a lot of half-naked men, and among them, oddly enough, more ugly bodies, than those that can be openly admired. But this is the irony and the power of this histrionics. After many men of stagnating small town were fired from a single city-forming enterprise â steel plant â they spontaneously decided to organize their own strip show, because have found that the women of the city are ready to lay out nice money for such a spectacle. The only thing they did not take into account â the aesthetic component of the enterprise â they have to look beautiful, but among them only one man with a really beautiful body is present (and with a good, muscular buttocks). But, on the other hand, the musical, in addition to its comic element (comedic scenes are abound here, believe us â the story itself suggests this), teaches of many important things. Firstly, that suicide â is not an option for a strong man out of difficult situations (in the course of the story, one of the future participants of strip show wanted to commit suicide after inhaling carbon monoxide in own car). After all, no matter what difficulty it would have been â loss of a job, a complete lack of money to pay the rent or a school for your children â you can always find the strength not to limp, but to collect all will in a fist, bite the bullet and go look for a job. Fifth, the eighteenth or the thirty-seventh interview shall necessarily bring a success. Secondly, despite the prevailing adverse life circumstances, if you are strong in body and in spirit, you can even arrange something of your own, and the lack of experience in the upcoming result really should not aware you, if you aspire very much for your own thing. After all, one way or another, almost all great things in the world were always been made by those who had no experience, but who was not afraid to go forward, not on the beaten track. Walked ways donât bring anything, except for the gray everydayâs life. And thirdly, if you are afraid to do something new â it's completely natural. Strong personalities use their fear for the sake of daring to winning jumps, turning it into courage. While weak persons, by contrast, will turn any virility into cowardice., , This musical visited, in addition to the main scenes of the world â Broadway and West End â yet many countries, with successful tours, infecting numerous hordes of fans with laughter and showing the boldness to reach new horizons. Only on Broadway, it went for 2 years, giving 800+ hits (during which there was a tragic event â actor K. Freeman died due to natural reasons, so he was replaced). All the continents, more than 20 countries â a very good achievement for a team of people, many of whom did not have previous experience in conduction of such grandiose productions. The Full Monty â the name was given because the participants of a strip show decided to ""go to the end"", completely undressing on the stage, rising the degree of popularity before its premiere among the female population of their hometown."
"151","Fun Home ","    A few months after the close of the play in 2014, it took some more readings in the form of music playing from the spectacle, which received exclusively rave reviews. The main actor Michael Cerveris had also been marked, who played the girl's father, about whose acting they said that it was one of the purest manifestations of theatrical skills, which allowed to bring people closely together., , Production has received such awards during its existence: 2014 (Lucille Lortel Awards â 3 wins and 6 other nominations, Edward M. Kennedy Prize â 1 nomination, Pulitzer Prize â was in finals, NY Drama Critics â 1 nomination, Outer Critics Circle Award â 1 win & 6 nominations, Drama League Award â 2 nominations, 2 victories of Obie, 8 nominations at Drama Desk Award, and, finally, Award of Off Broadway Alliance â 1 victory); 2015 (Tony â 5 wins & 7 another nominations, Theatre World â 2 Awards, one Grammy nomination)., , Sources for the production of this musical served a series of graphic novels, designed as memoirs by the author Alison Bechdel. It saw the light in 2006. Study started within 3 years, and after another 4, musical went to Broadway, and before that it was in another theater, earning more awards than its Broadwayâs version. Although, no doubt, the time spent on Broadway helped musical to pay off., , In the center of events intertwined 3 female incarnations in various times â when she was still a girl, adolescent and now a woman. She recalls her difficult relationship with father â a homosexual, who was even arrested for his criminal adventures, corrupting an underage boy, drunken him with an alcohol. Largely due to the strange world view, both a girl and her father could not in the future to build the normal life, because her father had been interesting in objects of his passion only: some junk from the dump, which his neighbor called âbarnâ, much more than in his own daughter and, even more so, in his wife. And since she did not see the object to follow, as well as normal loving relationships between her parents, she also chose for herself unusual orientation, started a relationship with her friend from college., , The brightest moments in the life of this simple girl were some kind of separate rays, when she launched a flying kite with her dad, or watched a TV. But more he was remembered to her as a person, who forbade her everything, including self-expression â when she wanted to wear jeans and a jacket, he forced her to wear a casual dress., , This is not the mainstream, it is not a benefit, but rather the cry of the soul of a person, who seemed to have lived all life in a cage, and was not able to get out of it, even up to 45 years, because the parents could not show her what really this world is: huge and interesting, with lot of different people and ideas, inhabit it. That is why she is both the protagonist and the antagonist. , , Of the 12 nominations on Tony â that is already an outstanding achievement â the musical received 5. And for good reason, because deserves attention here not just a game of actors, but also an excellent accompaniment of musicians, especially a pianist, sensitive to all necessary pauses. It is difficult to play with young actors, first and foremost, for themselves, but they deserve more than high praises for their efforts, as evidenced by the long list of awards and nominations."
"152","Funny Girl ","    Besides the fact that this musical to its 30-year anniversary has become a classic of the genre on Broadway, it initially gave very good, even in the current time, 1300+ regular shows and visited not only the West End, but also regional and international rounds. For example, in New Jersey show was in 2001, receiving warm reviews from critics. In particular, they admired the fact that new actors of this cast have tried to reproduce the atmosphere with dignity, originally created by Barbra Streisand and her partners on stage, as well as the creators â J. Styne & B. Merrill. In Illinois, the show was in 2009 â 2010 (directed by Gary Griffin). In 2012 â in Los Angeles and came back to Broadway in the same year. In spite of the difficulties experienced by that time (financial recession), when many producers were closing up their financial activity or significantly reduced it, histrionics still was staged, although with delay. In 2014, it took rebirth as a tour of the hottest countries in the America: Panama, Brazil, Ecuador, Argentina & Venezuela, and in 2015 on the same continent, there was one more spectacle., , London took a little updated show in 2015 in Menier Chocolate Factory, lasting until March 2016 with a new libretto, made by Harvey Fierstein. This version of the play even made a kind of record of speed of complete selling-out of tickets. Also, in April of 2016, the show will be in the form of a full-fledged resumption, when a show that is currently going, Guys and Dolls, will be completed in the same theater., , The original name of a musical was My Man, but it did not convey the vicissitudes of life of Fanny Brice, the story of whose life was trying to write for a dozen times Ray Stark. It came out well only in a few years from 12th attempt. Ray Stark was the original producer, and his interest in making of this thing was driven primarily by family ties with the deceased. Despite receiving eight nominations for Tony, in that year the musical was competing with a very strong histrionics Hello, Dolly! and that is why, it had not received any of cherished awards. Grammy Hall of Fame even included its recording in the repertoire in 2004."
"153","Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum","    This bright and humorous histrionics lives with its own life between the imposing columns of the ancient time and in colorful clothes of actors. There is everything: friendship, love, kindness, and stupidity, and even a pinch of total insanity for a better taste. Eventful history draws to itself; confuses and finally leaves a veil of ease and completeness of adult fairy tale, which is nice to remember for a long time., , Characters, like in any decent satire, bear expressive negative aspects, which are exacerbated to the point of irrationality under the weight of circumstances, as well as ridiculed., , However, not only the simple plot and charismatic protagonist-slave draw attention to this spectacle. Naive in his innocence, union of doll-courtesan and romantic young man from a wealthy Roman family, and the veil of first love. Do not forget about the freedom, of which dreamed about not only the slaves in ancient Rome. Also we see here the will to choose their own destiny, as opposed to outright stupidity of a large and important person, compensated with power and authority. Greed and insidiousness sex merchant, who sell slave-girls, is comical in its simplicity. Recognition of family squabbles between wife, her husband and parent-in-law as well as a hopeless and inconsolable search of the one who lost the most precious â his children. And â lo and behold â all served with a fine sense of thin and thick humor., , How could there not be born an extraordinary story with chases, absurd situations, sharp turns and all harmoniously combined in itself? Of course, those who want to see a deep and complete sense of the double bottom, please, donât waste your time. Stunning musical farce, lurid multicolored costumes, sarcastic replica, a fine line between gravitas and stupidity â that's what we can say about what is unfolding before our eyes. No, it's not frivolous, it is the most serious thing, which allows you to sit and to enjoy the visually relaxing atmosphere of burlesque."
"154","Gay Divorce","    The thin subject line involving the audience in series of intrigues and unexpected turns of events makes the musical bright and recognizable one. Mister Astaire is surprisingly good in his first solo performance. The director certainly wasn't mistaken, considering exactly this charismatic actor will be ideally suited for a role of the lover and modest writer of romance novels. Fred's virtuosity on a stage knows no limits and opens him as the many-sided personality, forcing the viewer to clap. Perhaps, the matter is that he is an actor, the dancer, the singer and the choreographer in combination. It is possible that he gave all the best on full, wishing to resume the career, but the fact remains that he coped with the role perfectly., , Claire Luce, playing the beauty â Mimi â who got the main character's heart, doesn't grow dim in this duet at all. The distinguished American with a surprising accuracy caught her role, without any fake changes, but having perfectly got used to it., , It is necessary to hand it also to the talented composer Cole Porter. His lovely ""Night and Day"", ""How's Your Romance?"" possess such inexpressible charm that became popular without binding to the musical., , The concert version staged at Carnegie Hall in New York in 1993, was certainly strongly upgraded and wasn't similar to the old ""colleagues"", but it turned out surprisingly live and bright. Robert Westenberg, who depicted the main character, is an amazing actor, which, even before participation in this musical, received several awards. An actress, well-known on the Broadway, and the soprano-singer, Rebecca Luker made a perfect duet with him., , Certainly, it would be wrong to compare performances of so different temporary intervals, but it is possible to tell with sureness that Gay Divorce with its fascinating plot and lyric songs is aimed on success by itself. It is enough to put a hand of masters, and the audience will be leaving a hall in the tremendous delight."
"155","Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder","    Serial killers may be all the rage on bookshelves and television screens â so ubiquitous, youâd think they made up a major demographic of the world population â but they are comparatively rare in the peppier precincts of musical theater. Now, after a long dry spell, Broadway has a deadly sociopath to call its own. Please give a hearty welcome to Monty Navarro, the conniving killer who helps turn murder most foul into entertainment most merry in the new musical âA Gentlemanâs Guide to Love & Murder.â, , Despite the high body count, this delightful show will lift the hearts of all those whoâve been pining for what sometimes seems a lost art form: musicals that match streams of memorable melody with fizzily witty turns of phrase. Bloodlust hasnât sung so sweetly, or provided so much theatrical fun, since Sweeney Todd first wielded his razor with gusto many a long year ago., , The seriously squeamish neednât fear entering the Walter Kerr Theater, where this frolicsome operetta opened on Sunday night. Although our antihero, played with brash innocence lightly sprinkled with arsenic by Bryce Pinkham, eventually piles up a stack of corpses to rival that of dear old Mr. Todd, heâs a much cuddlier fellow. A gentleman indeed, whose only wish is to secure his fortune by bumping off a few inconvenient relatives in Edwardian England., , Since these spoiled sprigs on the family tree are mostly stuffed shirts or stuffed skirts â and are all played by the dazzling Jefferson Mays â youâll be laughing too hard to shed a tear for any of them. (Those looking for fresh holiday entertainment for the family should know thereâs nothing here to frighten children.), , Mr. Mays won a Tony Award for playing multiple roles in the Pulitzer Prize-winning solo show âI Am My Own Wife,â but the chameleonic performance he gives here makes even that feat seem simple â a matter of filing your nails while whistling âEdelweiss,â say. In a true tour de force that is hardly likely to be bettered on Broadway this season (apologies to the magnificent Mark Rylance, and those two knights, Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart, performing Beckett and Pinter in repertory), Mr. Mays sings, dances, ice-skates, bicycles and generally romps through some eight roles â flipping among personas male, female and somewhere in between â at a pace that sets your head spinning. (Itâs almost an in-joke when one of his doomed characters meets his end through decapitation.), , Written by Robert L. Freedman (book and lyrics) and Steven Lutvak (music and lyrics), both welcome newcomers to Broadway, âGentlemanâs Guideâ is based on a 1907 novel by Roy Horniman. Fans of British film will recognize the plot from the classic British comedy âKind Hearts and Coronets,â which gave Alec Guinness a chance to display his own virtuosity as a raft of British gentlefolk falling prey to an ambitious relative. Here the mood is more farcical, the score a skillful homage to Gilbert and Sullivan, and the well-heeled family is called the DâYsquiths. (Thatâs DIE-squith, wouldnât you know.), , The penniless Monty little knows of his relationship to the clan when we find him, in the opening scene, mourning his newly deceased mother. A visit from an old friend of hers, the nosy Miss Shingle (the excellent Jane Carr), brings startling news: The mother he knew only as a Dickensian sufferer â scrubbing floors to feed her beloved only son â was in fact a highborn DâYsquith, banished forever when she ran off with a Castilian, defying her familyâs wishes., , âAnd by my estimation,â Miss Shingle casually adds, âonly eight other relations stand between you and the current Earl of Highhurst, Lord Adalbert DâYsquith himself.â, , This tempting tidbit lodges in Montyâs fertile mind and begins forthwith to sow dark intentions. Monty is on the verge of losing his love, the socially ambitious Sibella Hallward (Lisa OâHare), to a more well-heeled man. Might she not reconsider if Monty were to establish himself as a bona fide DâYsquith, or better yet, to hack his way through all that underbrush on the family tree and arrive at the tippy top, becoming the ninth earl of Highhurst?, , Fortune favors the brave, and soon Monty â through happenstance and the occasional bit of malicious handiwork â is rocketing up the social scale, as his relatives fall victim to unhappy, ahem, accidents. Under the nicely pitched direction of Darko Tresnjak â a Shakespeare specialist here making his own impressive Broadway debut â Montyâs journey unfolds as a series of brisk comic vignettes, set to songs that honorably re-create the boisterous heyday of the English music hall and the prime of 19th-century operetta. (The charming set, by Alexander Dodge, features a gorgeously detailed Victorian-style stage within a stage, and the spot-on period costumes are by Linda Cho.), , I could fill the rest of my review with quotations from the lyrics that particularly tickled. Hereâs just a morsel, from one of the showâs highlights, a comic ditty lampooning the rapacities of would-be do-gooders, in which Lady Hyacinth DâYsquith (Mr. Mays, natch), desperate to find a new cause to champion, lights on the opportunities in darkest Africa:, , Weâll civilize a village in the jungle!, , It canât take long to learn their mother tongue!, , Of words they have but six,, , And five of them are clicks,, , And all of them are different words for dung!, , Mr. Lutvak and Mr. Freedman may be reworking forms that have been previously established, primarily the patter song and the romantic ballad. But their score still establishes itself as one of the most accomplished (and probably the most literate) to be heard on Broadway in the past dozen years or so, since the less rigorous requirements of pop songwriting have taken over., , It is beautifully sung by the rich-voiced cast, with Mr. Pinkham handling his heavy chores with a light touch, his firm tenor matched by pleasingly (and necessarily) precise diction. Ms. OâHare plays Sibella with pertness and poise, and has a bright, clear soprano. So, too, does the wonderful Lauren Worsham, who plays Phoebe DâYsquith, the rival for Montyâs heart, with a demure sweetness that never cloys. (Fortunately for Phoebe, she is not in the direct line of heirs to the DâYsquith fortune.), , Mr. Mays is not a musical theater specialist, to be sure, which makes his accomplishment here all the more impressive. Most of his songs donât make any great demands on the tonsils (heâs largely doing patter material), but he manages to sing in a variety of voices, distinguishing each character with a distinctive sound., , A distinctive look and personality, too: the dazed, toothy dottiness of the Rev. Lord DâEzekial; the buxom heartiness of Lady Hyacinth; the pompous grumpiness of the reigning Lord Adalbert; the tallyho perkiness of the bright-eyed beekeeper Henry (spinning forth hilarious yet never vulgar double-entendres in a mock-homoerotic duet with Monty, âBetter With a Manâ)., , As each precise caricature of British snootiness or silliness comes bounding onto the stage, Mr. Mays seems to be challenging himself to elicit bigger laughs, and he almost always succeeds. All but one of his characters ends up six feet under by the time this daffy, inspired musical concludes, but his brilliant performance deserves to be immortalized in Broadway lore for some time to come."
"156","Gentlemen Prefer Blondes ","    Who won't like the musical, cheerful, bright, interesting, bewitching, dazzling and positive comedy with beautiful girls on the stage and perfect songs, which have already become cult? Maybe the plot is quite plain (read: very plain), but its simplicity finds out in itself a special charm that will please even the most experienced and picky viewer. , , Besides the brilliant performing part, the musical gladden with tremendous songs â just remember the legendary ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" which has become probably even more popular, than the movie â perfectly staged choreography, which helps each actor to open the apogee of the artistry and charisma, and witty jokes. A comic piece of the musical is really at height. That's a pleasure to watch the charming blonde continually getting into various scrapes. No wonder that Lorelei's role brought to her first performer, an actress Carol Channing, so resounding success., , However, it is necessary to mark out the gorgeous actress and singer, Megan Hilty, who acted as Lorelei at the New York City Center in 2012. Hilty was not only the cause of the audienceâs delight, but also received only rave reviews from critics. No wonder that after such an excellent show she was rated on par with Marilyn Monroe and Carol Channing. Besides Hilty, there were such well-known names, as incomparable Brennan Brown, Simon Jones and Rachel York. Considering these stars, as well as perfect direction and choreography, there are no questions why it was quite difficult to get tickets and the hall was overflowed. It was worth it, though., , Versatility of the blondeâs role also was introduced by Marilyn Monroe, starring in the movie of 1953 of the same name. That's impossible not to admire this talented girl, a little naive, charmingly flirting, light-minded, but clever and able to get out of any, even the most difficult situations., , Classical scheme: adventures, intrigues, cruises on the ocean liner, millionaires, canaries, magnificent dresses. Rich life. Rich with everything: emotions, impressions, pleasure â from thought that you live and you live well. The Great Gatsby â similarity in luxury, fast life and love peripeteias is involuntarily remembered, however, the drama component of the last one is much stronger. Gentlemen prefer blondes â an easy-going thing, what makes it nice, doesn't apply for serious philosophical reflections, but leaves pleasant aftertaste. Recommended to everyone, who wants just a pleasant recreation."
"157","George M! ","    The full name of the talented composer, singer, dancer and producer is George Michael Cohan, but he is better known as George M. Cohan. , , Without doubts, life of this ambitious and hardworking person can become the example for many people of what success may purposeful and go-ahead person achieve in the creative sphere of life. His course of life is traced in the musical, from the most youthful years, when the future star acted in show together with the family, to peak of his career, when the young Cohan, singing the words of ""Give My Regards to Broadway"" on the stage, turned into the successful producer who writes the shows by himself and takes part in his own works. , , Certainly, as well as in each celebrity's life, in George's were both ups and downs. Difficulties and barriers on the way of reaching the goal, quarrels with the wife and divorce, disappointments and re-comprehension of oneself. However, no matter what had happened, he was always close to his family, which really supported Cohan and believed in him., , That was successfully, that for the first time, the talented star was performed by Joel Grey. The charismatic singer, actor and photographer amazingly accurately, according to the critic words, reproduced George's character, artistic, persistent, charming and living with his shows. No wonder, that he received an award as the best performer in the musical â when you look at the tricks, which talented Joel gives out on the scene, it is impossible to remain sitting still â there is a wish to break into a dance immediately. Certainly, this is a great merit of the American choreographer Joe Layton who was also awarded by a Tony Award, becoming a winner for Best Choreography., , Besides visual gloss of show: atmospheric suits, tremendous Cohan's music and brilliant game of all the performing part, it is impossible to forget about an important biographic fullness of this work. The musical purpose is not only to amuse the viewer, but, first of all, to acquaint with life of an outstanding person, therefore the drama component is brightly expressed, and the viewer, being imbued with what is happening, by the end will be both, smiling, as well as sad."
"158","Ghost the Musical ","    If I pale at writing this review, it's because I've just seen a Ghost. Screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin won an Oscar for the 1990 film as did Whoopi Goldberg, supporting Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore. The film was also nominated for best picture back when there were only five a year. But all that star power and the sub-Borzage skills of director Jerry Zucker helped to camouflage the flimsy clunkiness of the story's material, exposed in all its clumsy manipulation by a musical adaptation that emphasizes artificial big moments and sentimental sign-posting over grace notes and anything else that might distinguish it from plain-wrap romanticism., , Sam Wheat (Steven Grant Douglas), a young Wall Street success, and ceramist Molly Jenson (Katie Postotnik) have just moved into a fabulous fix-up Brooklyn apartment and are edging toward marriage when Sam is murdered in a staged mugging. Sam's ghost remains invisible yet earthbound, capable of supernatural powers but powerless to reach out to the grief-stricken Molly â except through the intercession of phony medium Oda Mae Brown (Carla R. Stewart), who feels panicked by the onset of true psychic powers. Sam must find a way to protect Molly from harm at the hands of his money-laundering, two-faced colleague Carl (Robby Haltiwanger), whose blandness is perhaps the only counterbalance to his mustache-twirling villainy., , The comic, spiritual and romantic elements are so generic that only the slightest pretext is made to create any character or situation beyond signaling stereotypes, offering thundering cues as to how to react to every situation. There is no progression or development, only the invocation of a fuzzy pedestrian transcendentalism. It's as if our feelings are being subject to chiropractic adjustment, entertainment by carefully applied blunt force. By contrast, Topper bubbled., , Fatally for a musical, the songs reinforce the innate phoniness with pop lyrics devoid of nutritional content and music of such little character that the ornamental belting can sound like braying, despite the good voices of the cast. Composers and co-lyricists Dave Stewart (of Eurythmics fame but more recently a songwriter with and producer for Stevie Nicks, Tom Petty, Katy Perry and Bon Jovi) and Glen Ballard (Alanis Morissette, Michael Jackson, Aerosmith, Dave Matthews, Christina Aguilera) may together have sold a quarter-billion albums. Yet for all their prolific success, they have mastered the art of formula, having here produced a full program of anonymous soundtrack power ballads and anemic novelty numbers., , It's something of a pity because there is a lot of misapplied theatrical talent on display under strenuous yet savvy direction by Matthew Warhus. While the show elements may lack conviction, they are topnotch, if spottily credited. The production design is smartly tricked out, if at times self-consciously ""cinematic,"" and the costumes and choreography are vivid despite the roteness of the conceptions. In particular, the stage special effects are rather impressive, a very 21st-century translation of 19th-century Belasco-style spectacle: Spectral figures pass through apparently impermeable barriers yet are unable to break through the invisible shield separating the dead from the living, literalizing the imagined quest of the soul for connection with our uncomprehending bodies., , But when â spoiler alert â Carl's soul rises from his corpse only to be sucked downward into red-lighted hell, there is none of the existential terror that was felt when the same stunt was accomplished so much more simply the week before in the David Lang opera in Long Beach (even though that dematerializing character was a complete cipher), because there we were provided a musical and dramatic context for the experience, and here it is merely an opportunity for ostentatious display. , , Yet who's to quibble with brand-name uniformity? Ghost: The Musical, which may have died on Broadway after a mere 136 performances in 2012, now resurrects itself through this touring edition of the U.K. production, reaching out to connect with its audience on the road: The Pantages was near capacity at the first Sunday matinee and it played to them like Ghostbusters."
"159","Gigi ","    Complexity of the performances based on the plot, similar to the novel ""Gigi"", consists, generally, in sustaining a fine line, separating a charm of rich levity and forwardness from openly trite tones. And, in this relation, the movie of 1958 is amazingly good. No wonder that the love story, shaded by delightful landscapes, parks and fountains, brought to the Lerner-Loewe duet recognition and commercial success. , , However, despite different formats, it may safely be said that Anita Loos's musical of 1951 isn't inferior to the movie at all. Certainly, it is impossible to call that only young and charming Audrey Hepburn's merit, but she really introduced in Gigi's role the versatility, sincerity and a female seduction that are her way., , Comparing this play to the musical of 1973 and Hepburn with Karin Wolfe, the second undoubtedly lose to the first in everything, from the atmosphere to the intensity of the central character. And even legendary ""The Earth and Other Minor Things"" sounds absolutely differently. Joseph Hardy's musical, without doubts, could dip the viewer into the beauty and charm of expensive suits and bright surroundings, but to understand, what Colette wanted to convey, it would be rather hard., , However, the play of 2015, which could be seen in Kennedy Center's Eisenhower Theatre, pleasantly surprises. Despite the contradictory attitude to the modernization of the classic versions, the audience, apparently, was struck on the spot by charming Gigi â Vanessa Anne Hudgens. And no wonder: we don't know any people who remain indifferent by the sight of a bewitching mimicry of this sunny girl., , All in all, everyone has its own perception of the events on-a-stage. On the assumption of how difficult it was to get tickets on this musical, in spite of the fact that the theme of courtesans and marriages of convenience has become outdated a long time ago, it is possible to conclude that the audience is really involved in similar plots even if thoughts of the author aren't always reproduced correctly."
"160","Glorious Ones","    With the cheerful music of Stephen Flaherty, the strange troupe of comedians invites the audience to Italy of the 16th century, telling about the life and diluting vulgar jokes with dramatic revelations. The musical will hardly surprise with something original, if the viewer is already familiar with commedia dellâarte genre. Actors don't do anything original, and clownish suits, as well as images, seem very and very clichÃ©d. The dwarf, the Arlechino, and a beautiful noblewoman â what can be more banal?, , On the other hand, it is necessary to agree with journalists of New York Times, that this ordinary humor and classical comical show has something attractive. At some point, you are even filled with sympathy to the main character, who continually tries to kill himself â whether for fun or really. Marc Kudisch appears as the real leader of troupe â self-confidence is supported with depth of his velvety voice. Kudisch obviously feels oneself at ease and exudes complacency. However, we see as real human problems and experiences that are behind a curtain of a humor and trite jokes, and actors undoubtedly should be praised for that., , The number of characters here is not glaring at all. Julyana Soelistyo as the faddish dwarf, Arlechino â Jeremy Webb and charming Erin Davie look surprisingly harmoniously, as well as the other participants of troupe. Dancing numbers are dynamic and well put, despite their plainness, all this action looks quite spiritedly., , Certainly, this comic genre, which has really passed through centuries, as the main character says in the end of the musical, has the right for existence. Eventually, these obscene jokes, as correctly as it possible, show another, dirty side of life of the travelling troupe, their internal disagreements and love intrigues. The absence of love to low-grade humor isn't an argument enough not to watch the musical, but can disappoint the viewer, as such works are only for the special audience that is cynical enough to behold the world as it is."
"161","Glory Days ","    The new musical, which cornerstone the heartfelt history about the matured friends, was born by Gardiner's and Blaemir's efforts. The history shows what it means to be young, and is not seasoned with excessive dramatization or doesn't consist storming teenage hormones., , ""Glory Days"" won't surprise the viewer with radical subject peripeteias, unexpected events and a lot of action, but will acquaint with the world of the average children comprehending how people change with the age., , The characters, created by joint efforts, turned out live, sincere, timid and, at the same time, expressional. It seldom turns out to represent truthfully teenagers, with their internal torments and problems, but in this case, actors passed the task perfectly. Perhaps, the matter is, that the Blaemire-Gardiner duet stepped not so long ago over a twentieth anniversary by itself and understanding of the other young people's psychology is absolutely correct, they precisely know what they are speaking about, and their confidence is delivered to the actors., , The men really perfectly got used to the roles: Steven Booth as the sensitive main character, silly Andy â A. C. Call, a cynical Skip (Adam Halpin) and Jessie P. Johnson, which starred as contradictory Jack with his secret. , , Scenery in this theatrical doesnât play any role. Probably, the location is supposed to be chosen absolutely incidentally. Here, in the center of attention â the psychological conflict, which inflames between the boys. Friends philosophize, quarrel, and try to find themselves that is perfectly felt with lyrical and sincere songs., , Thatâs impossible to call the musical a very popular one, but despite it, similar works always find the viewer, whom youthful experiences will be close to or who will be simply able to estimate high-quality and hard work."
"162","Godspell ","    It is surprising, how classical and melodious Broadway play, staged forty years ago thanks to Tebelak, was transformed into the modernized show of 2011 with charismatic and inimitable Hunter Parrish as the Messiah. Feeling as if you appear in one room with a heap the energetic and carefree children., , The Goldstein & Gatelliâs duet gives rise to the amazing, bright and dynamic musical, upgraded in the best traditions of 21 century. This modern history of Jesus and his followers, as much as possible fits into a century of Facebook, Twitter and constant progress., , It is possible to look at similar experiments differently. Counting percent of the conservative theatergoers inclined to digest exclusively old-kind classics in its monotonous and instructive character, it is easy to understand, why opinions and reviews of new Broadway work are so contradictory. However, looking at this on the other hand, the morals, remade with a modern harmony, nevertheless remain morals, but to inform it to contemporaries by means of jokes and tricks is much simpler. Melodious and lyrical songs sound in a new way now, uniting the most various musical styles, including even a rap. Whoever spoke whatever, but the audience enthusiastically claps, and especially its young part., , Actors in their somewhat eccentric and motley suits which aren't combined with each other, Jesus with a dazzling wide smile and a pure look of blue eyes, more similar to the soloist of any boyish band â all this gives to the audience the unique and unusual atmosphere. Certainly, it is possible to treat the similar performances, affecting certain ""eternal subjects"", in different ways. Someone would be delighted with a new and original view of founders, someone remains dissatisfied with such free revival, but definitely, there would be no one stayed indifferent."
"163","Golden Boy ","    The adaptation, turned the main character into the Afro-American, leads this musical to the class of those, which would be actual for all the times. As when the movement for the civil rights was in its height, as now, when the same problems with the same force were on peak, as at the present times. A chosen subject is very specific and the plot of the musical a priori adjusts a viewer on a drama. Adding a tragic romance with the white girl makes the musical successful among a sensitive audience. From time to time, it can be cheerful, but the end will precisely force if not to shed a tear, than to deeply become thoughtful. Of course, it can already be considered a worthy merit of founders., , Not less powerful contribution was left by legendary Samuel George Davis Jr., whose skill doesn't cease to surprise every time, when you reconsider videos with his performances on a stage. That's a contradictory nature, whose wide smile of the showman is combined with deep drama filling. Davis skillfully plays on contrasts, it is simply impossible to come off his play. In addition, that it is possible to consider all his pluses and minuses, at some point it becomes similar to a show of single actor, who is easily eclipsing all others with himself, but sometimes it is felt that it is a musical with many narrative stories, after all. , , Certainly, songs were also written under a unique manner of Davis. The Strouse-Adams duet properly tried, having created such things, as ""Can't You See It?"", ""Night Song"" and other singing, which are given rise, when executed by Davis. Of course, the association in that point is rather with the jazz singer, than with the boxer, but it is impossible, after all, to criticize the actor for his too bright identity, isn't it?, , Even those who are not fond of the interracial conflicts, should see the play, at least for the sake of a fascinating plot with an unexpected, tragic outcome, the inimitable actor in a leading role and delightful music."
"164","Gone Missing ","    The Civilians ingenious organization, which has already created 7 original performances, is allocated in a theater world by making the shows on documentary base, using for collection of informational investigation, interviews, social polls and different other methods. They create a peculiar mix of a pure art and journalism that does each their work a bright and unique piece., , As the example, Gone Missing, which central themes were losses in all of their meanings and manifestations, admires the viewer with originality of an idea and gloss of execution. It is remarkable that founders didn't fix talk with interviewees, they were also not written down by actors. Thus, all scenes of the play seem bright and live, despite their real documentary basis. These are the monologues untied among themselves, diluted with the beautiful music of Michael Friedman, this is an amazing show, emotional and vital, after all its subject is close to each of us., , Dressed in identical classical gray Sarah Beers' suits, main characters with all their cast of look and mind show as people are identical in loosing something, and doesn't matter, what exactly they have lost. Inimitable Jennifer R. Morris, as the girl who lost her favorite shoes, explains that even the most ordinary thing can be a mascot for her owner. Moreover, a bright role of the police officer, performing by Stephen Plunkett, who tells about missing parts of a body., , Sentimental scenes also exist, including perfect Colleen Werthmannâs telling of a touching story about the girl, who lost a doll. Anyway, it can't leave public indifferent, after all, but at least one of the stories will cut into the brains quickly., , The musical turned out really whimsical. No wonder, why it has received so many enthusiastic comments of well-known American magazines. It is impossible to come off so excellent played life occurring on a scene in front of your eyes."
"165","Good News ","    The earlier version of the musical received good comments of critics. They estimated its singing and power. It was described as a show with the tremendous atmosphere of college. The second version didn't receive such enthusiastic comments. Critics called it the pathetic copy (and âpatheticâ in this case didnât mean âgreatâ). Someone considered that it is a parody of classics. Jokes in the musical were called banal. Critics believed that directors shouldn't have remade the original idea. However, there were also those who disagreed with part of critics. Someone considered that there was an excellent dancing show in the musical. Some critics noted a presence of original style and deep meaning in it. In general, the opinion of critics was ambiguous. , , The latest version of the musical made almost the same success as the first. They saw a good casting and choreography in it. However, critics noted that duration of show should be reduced a little to make it more energetic. When the second version of the musical took place, the hall was filled with incompleteness. However, its large part was still occupied in an enough ration to keep a musical going., , The technical part of the musical, undoubtedly, makes a great impression. Bright suits, vigorous music, atmosphere â all these things are perfectly embodied on the stage. The songs will make you smile; many of them will remain in your head for a long time. Bright â this synonym is really suitable to the musical. But these are all significant pluses which can be allocated in this play. A viewer may get the impression that all these effects were created to distract him or her from some disadvantages of the performance., , Of course, any musical, first of all, is a show. But directors have to do everything not to turn this show in an ordinary beautiful picture. In this case, the form is hardly in the harmony with the contents. The musical has rather predictable plot. The story takes place around rich teenagers of the 20th. It is too simple telling about the football hero of a college, who falls in love with the clever girl, while preparing for the exam. He has to do a choice: to betray his team and to stay with the girl he loves or to marry the rich girl, because her father provides the team. All the time that is not occupied with songs, these students talk about who dates whom. But what else is possible to expect from a teenage comedy?, , In spite of the fact that the musical hasnât any deep meaning, it is impossible watch it without smile. It is not necessary in a show about carefree youth. Acting of cocky girls from sorority pleases. Incredibly charming, they don't have any difficulties in drawing attention of such attractive boys. Playing of the guys can take you far away from all âadultâ problems. The work of the costumier should be especially noted. Unique style of the 20th is reflected in clothes of teenagers. Scenic dressing was quite modest. But all this was compensated with bright images and excellent light design., , Well, if you want to see a sublime show, to feel the spirit of youth and to take pleasure in wonderful voices, you should watch this performance. But if you are going to see it in a hope to find a big sense and an unpredictable plot, you will probably be disappointed."
"166","Goodbye Girl","    Sometimes a parting with darling brings so much pain that it becomes difficult to begin the new relations because you are afraid that everything can repeat. If you even find a new partner, you continue to look for any parallels with your previous love and see them. However, it is not correct to perceive new relations such way. People should try to turn them into the brightest and the warmest period in their life. The similar idea was included into a basis of the romantic comedy ""The Goodbye Girl""., , Watching the musical is a true pleasure because a viewer can seldom see the real talent, not an illusion of playing. The main actress acted a very ridiculous role of Paula, former dancer who has complex because of the age and painful parting with her groom all the time. Her scene partner has a role of the jobless comedy actor who is guided by his own philosophy of life, which cures Paula. At last, it is necessary to mention an unforgettable role of pretty girl Lucie. She is very wise and always understands the mother and helps her. , , Scenic and light designs were modest. But it is quite clear, because the emphasis was placed on the meaning, not on the picture. Itâs rather unusual occurrence for musical., , The director created a classical romantic comedy, in the form in which it should be. He probably tried to achieve the positive atmosphere, which wouldn't bore the viewers but would only attract their attention. The fact that the director showed the development of relations between the main characters, is especially pleasant. They arenât constructed on hatred as it can be often seen. In spite of the fact that the musical has a pretty banal ending, the director has succeeded to represent it very beautifully., , The plot of the musical is very simple and can even seem quite ordinary. Nevertheless, it managed pretty good to reflect a problem of parting and its consequence. It should be noted that the musical is suitable for family viewing. The fact, that this show is intended for the wide audience, was clear: the hall was full on almost each performance. In total, this performance causes a sea of emotions, and its amazing songs will play in your head for a long period of time after."
"167","Grand Hotel ","    Sometimes we think about what a strange thing life is. With one people, the life is kind, with others is cruel. We are eternally running somewhere, we read something and we eat something. At first sight, it can seem to us that all people are identical, because they generally carry out things, which are similar to each other. However, it becomes noticeable that people differ, after all. The huge number of art works were devoted to a theme of such various destinies. And this amazing musical didn't become an exception., , The show has a fine direction. The director created the classical drama with romantic implication. That was the most pleasant â he didn't try to make the heroes identical. The history of the certain character is a separate plot and genre. Grushinskaya's story (the ballerina) is a drama about the lost glory. Otto's telling is the sharp social drama about the desperate person, who has nothing to lose. The history of Preysing is a narration about the brutal bureaucrat who lost values of all moral norms. Despite the differences between characters, the director managed to gather all of them in a whole., , As it was told earlier, the plot is a structure of several parallel lines, narrating about destinies of different characters. The main idea of the musical was to show that all people are not similar to each other. The grand hotel is the representative selection from the whole world, in which love, fear, hatred, offense, pleasure and death â everything is bound, just like in reality. So many years passed from the date of a premiere, and people are still vain, still pursue wealth and still are in captivity of prejudices., , Art feature of the show deserves a special praise, because the hotel showed as luxury and splendor place. Thereby they transfer the atmosphere of the 20th years. The special impression was made by the main hall with its round form (it symbolizes the whole world), about which people are eternally knocking. Suits, dresses, a make-up, dances, cars and even fights â everything in this musical gives us a visual representation about that era. The acting impresses and admires. At some moments, the falseness is felt, but when the image of the character appears more fully â the hasty opinion disappears, and on its place stays a pleasant impression from the seen. The voices of actors really bewitch. Dances in the musical are tremendous â no wonder that show received an award for choreography., , It should be noted that the musical is suitable only for adult audience: there are several scenes of violence and inter-gender sensuality. However, it doesn't spoil a look of the performance. Grand Hotel deserves the highest appreciation for its beauty and sincerity. It is the classics, which will be true for all the time."
"168","Greetings From Yorkville ","    Can we find a more vital topic than a story of the roadway in holding in contempt and cruel world of show business? A team of talent personalities takes up to reveal the story itself about how they were looking for a reliable point of support and their own place under the sun, although it would be more correct to say â under the spotlight. This is the story of the struggle for their destiny, about the long road to the desired and, seemingly unattainable, success., , This pair is a great melodic union. They are music partners, partners in life and completely in all things, they are a perfect example of mutual understanding and tremendous work on self to overcome own fears and to learn on mistakes. They have no hypocrisy and farce, no glossy shine, but there are simplicity and sincerity, which captivate and attract attention from the first glance., , While not indigenous New-Yorkers, they were able to break into its world. Their shows were quite well known, bright and memorable, especially for off-Broadway productions., , Anya's voice is mesmerizing. Deep, low and clear, it conquers the listener from the first notes of its sounding, and play of Robert on the piano is unlike any other artist. The feature of his ear for music allows him to pass between diametrically opposite styles in the play, without making mistakes. Smooth narration of nice masters of their craft, exhibiting the real story and the spirit of the times, the spirit of New York itself, and showing us the courage, even at a time when the fate inexorably separates them, but only for that very same length of life, which is necessary to check and to prove their own aspirations to each other and to life in general. It is a juicy musical show with a drop of humor and irony, ingenious fortitude and love of these two people., , They make it clear that none of the circumstances of life is worth to forget how beautiful and multi-faceted life is. The easier step is, the easier the road in general, doesnât it? This is the main result of two passionate performers, who have dedicated their last song inside of a show: ""Life is good"" to this notion."
"169","Grey Gardens ","    If you need motivation, here it is â in this very production. This musical shows that are rarely seen, and what allows to penetrate into without plunging. Broken hopes, lack of self-belief and fear of making another attempt to find happiness, thereby allowing oblivion to take days, months, years, decades of life. When loneliness and maddening monotony, shrouded daysâ poverty have become commonplace and even essential nature and a substance of the human being, it becomes impossible to imagine that it can be otherwise somehow., , Two women shared not only their names, but the fate prepared for them, not have lived a wonderful life, but becoming themselves prisoners of an estate, giving up to fears and horrors that have nothing to do with mysticism. No. This horror, to which you succumb, eats you. It is not to the circumstances, but to time itself. Time that takes away all the pleasure that people were not able to grab., , History is truly tragic and dramatic, but also instructive: you cannot stand idly by allowing relentless hour and minute arrows to take away the only thing that can fully belong to a person â the life. Four decades two women lived in fear and were shamed to see people, not daring to look objectively at their situation. The silence and poverty around their fading lives is totally gloomy. About them remembers only health department that worried about the state of land that has been captivated by cats and raccoons., , Many years later, when the younger Edith will stand in front of the poster, expecting a film about herself, she, of course, will recall the young years, when everything was simple and easy, when the red carpet saw newborn stars, and the world of show business could conquer anyone, having a little bit of talent and charm, or âsmiledâ to producer. When her own chance burned in her hands, was irrevocably lost due to her mother, who was unable to let go the daughter, who was afraid of deadly loneliness, and because of own cruel indecision., , Not like that she imagined moments of fame, hoping to taste its sweet fruit, but made is irrevocable, you donât return the past. And once two eccentric, talented and bright ladies faded along with the Grey Gardens, lost in the grayness of timelessness. Sunset of crazy and infinitely unhappy life of once powerful people â the spectacle is really frightening and unpleasantly chilling the chest. Do not doubt â this show is commendable."
"170","Grind ","    The performance, first and foremost, discloses the problem of racism. Maybe it did not quite, in our opinion, immensely, but it tried to do it with dignity. Not too obviously opened disapproval of infringement of the rights of Afro-American population, is if not the main idea of this musical, but definitely one of such ones. The fed idea does not seem too convincing (maybe the play of actors was fade), and this opinion was shared by the majority of beholders, since the show has managed to perform the absolute box-office failure, and was named as one of the most unprofitable investments of this period., , Love line was crumpled, not disclosed until the end and didnât keep the tension, unlike the actress, who played the role of a stripper (she received several awards for her acting and, despite the failure of the show, it became her springboard). Stunning voice, magnificent grace and charm gave a hell of impression of her. The histrionics was closed, but the talented actress has been able to express herself so vividly, so this allowed her to earn the extremely favorable reviews and a role in other successful productions., , Writers did not forget about the question of friendship, showing in the plot, revealing that the main thing is what kind of person is in front of you, not in what way you desire to look at him or her. The Irishman, binding two camps with own simplicity, blind white male, a stripper and simple fellow-actor. The very fact of their friendship may already seem surprising, if not knowing that they are gathered in the burlesque show under one roof., , The performance was relevant even in 80th years of the past century, when the question of segregation was still sharply-edged in American society, but excessive congestion of small details spoiled the whole story, as for us. Why, for example, the viewer should know that Doyle was once a criminal, who killed own family? Does it add to his charm? Perhaps, of course, they wanted to make a some kind of intrigue â mystery Irishman, as a feature of one of the characters? But did it shallowly and tasteless. Spirit of the Depression was tried to be reflected in the characters, in the circumstances, played out on the stage, but it was flagitious."
"171","Gutenberg! The Musical! ","    Two silly-looking guys in shirts, ties and ridiculous headdresses play the fools on a stage, interacting with different improvised subjects and telling the story unscrewed to a limit about the great German first printer under the laughter and an applause of public ready to eat any apple thrown in it, even if also the worm-eaten., , Many modern performances are based on absurdity and pseudo-originality. Concerning the Broadway â it is a quite wide layer of the satirical play where musicals as much as possible depart from standards of the initial genre. However, let's face the truth, this new Chicago version is rather a representation of two clowns, than the work applying for any gravity. Certainly, there is nothing bad in easy absurdity, forcing the viewer to laugh to tears. Nevertheless, the main mistake is that the duet occupying a scene revels by the humor that kills all idea on a root., , The plot also causes contradictory emotions. Worshipping to a Satan monk, the inventor, famous for the whole world with the silly assistant in love with him â all this looks bad the thought-over pun. The Bliss and Goodrich duet already terribly changes right at the beginning. Where it is necessary to be funny, they seem silly, and their charisma isn't enough to rescue a situation. Feeling that this couple plays in school representation, and even in general addresses audience of kindergarten., , One more problem is that theatrical doesn't show absolutely anything new. Golden rule of the comic environment: do better than those who did it before you, is absolutely broken here. It concerns also performance of songs; it is more reminding a stamped aping and a mangling of initial versions of songs that we observed hundreds of times and in much better execution before. Moreover, actors revel in themselves, too much attention is paid on them, but not to a musical component that generally should be the main thing in performances of this sort. It seems, clean the hall, which isn't really filled with the audience, and they will continue to wriggle, laughing at each other's jokes., , It's hard to say that viewing of the musical was absolutely failure. After all, initial work of Scott Brown and Anthony King in itself is quite witty; parts of the play are stuck well together and perfectly contrast among each other. In principle, if you are the admirer of clichÃ©d scenes of this genre, you would even laugh and do it loudly. Closer to the final, songs sound more harmoniously and you involuntarily get used to the action happening on a scene. A question is, whether you will be also impressed after an exit from the hall, not to mention an interval like one day after a while. The answer, we suspect, is negative."
"172","Guys and Dolls ","    Colorful, easy and funny. This show perfectly conveys the atmosphere of the early years of twentieth century in New York. Gambling, good humor, fascinating and engaging choreography look smooth on scene and music immerses in the story of the gambling business, of guys and their long-suffering ""dolls""., , Light veil of romance in the couple's relationship, which all fourteen years have celebrated annually their engagement, not being able to get married because of him, and in a weightless naivety of flared love of two young hearts., , We can say that Frank Lussera really managed to create a pleasant picture, beholding which you can enjoy, being distracted from, of course, much more gray reality., , Staging quite rightly was awarded with the prize as the best musical of the year, and after time passed, it has been included in the list of best musicals (landed on 23rd place out of 25), according to the American Film Association., , The main roles were assigned to outstanding actor that has been a key to the success of the performance. Robert Alda perfectly demonstrated on stage handsome Sky, and his duet with Isabel Bigley (Sarah Brown) looked very harmoniously and smoothly. Vivian Blaine (who, incidentally, played the role of the bride of Nathan Detroid in the movie) looked good in a company of Sam Levene (Nathan). Talented cast was perceived well, and the actors were fully able to help each other to reveal their characters."
"173","Gypsy ","    Nomadic life of mother and two of her daughters is full of difficulties. They earn money with songs and dances. But the Gipsy blood flows in their veins, so the soul of these women is full of love to freedom and to music. Mother Rose dreams that her daughter June will successfully act in the vaudeville on the Broadway. When June marries and leaves home, Rose starts laying hopes for the younger daughter Louise. However, she only manages to get a job of the stripper in Burlesque., , This biographic musical is about life of great ""queen of a burlesque"", the best-known dancer and the stripper of the 30th â Gypsi Rose Li. However, the directors of the show put in the center of narration her mother Rose. At the beginning, Rose pays all the attention to the other daughter June, ""child star"" of Broadway vaudevilles. And when June is tired of excessive attention of mother and leaves, Mother Rose remembers about less talented Louise., , Plot is quite common: it's about the broken, cancelled desires of actresses to subdue the Land of dream. It's also about their persistent, furious aspiration to be rehabilitated in it by their children, to whom they shout: ""I should be on your place!"" The moral is: âParents, don't take away the childhood from your child!â After all, it is the finest period in their life., , Formally, the performance keeps only at the excellent play of Mother Rose. It moves to the forefront, and the history of two daughters' formation serves as a fine background for her actor's passages., , All vocal performances are harmoniously included into the show. The remarkable work of the costume designer is also worth noting, though this biographic play isn't a ""wardrobe"" musical style of clothes corresponds to time frames., , Of course, this version of Gypsy does not completely copy the Broadwayâs piece, but it's a good attempt. The viewer can be a little upset by the main characters who sometimes can't sing their vocal parts correctly. Good play, fervent actors and actresses. , , However, the price doesn't correspond to quality. But if you just want to plunge into a world of a Burlesque and America of 30th, no doubt, it is for you."
"174","Hair ","    With this musical linked multiple waves of ripples on the surface of the consciousness of society. Legal ripple was associated with the filing of the sue claim from the creators of the performance to the organizers of the Tony ceremony, who did not want to include this musical in the Tonyâs list in 1968. The following year, it was presented in two categories, but did not get any awards â in retaliation, obviously, for this unfortunate incident. In addition, on many sites, on which it was, people badly treated to scenes of full nudity and numerous profanity that were there. The West End had to even cancel the legal regulations, allowing musical to stage there, but the result has surpassed even Broadway on the number of spectacles., , Bertrand Castelli, founder and inspirer of idea of this musical, adapted it to local conditions, despite the rule that musicals from Broadway has never did so, always playing in English without being tied to the realities of the hosting country. Here the viewer can find French, German, and Mexican adaptation, among others. In Germany, the opening held also in 1968, as well as on Broadway, in Sydney â in 69 (staying there for 2 years). In Mexico, the show was shown only 1 time, and then was banned by the country's authorities. In Brazil the opening was also in 1969. In Belgrade (Serbia) show was revealed even to the communist regime â the first Broadway musical that dared on such an extreme step. Among the other countries that the show visited, were: Austria, Israel, Scandinavia, Switzerland, Canada, Netherlands, Japan & Italy. At the end of 1970, the show has been the most widely played Broadway play â simultaneously, it was reproducible in 300 locations, being the most successful production in the history of NY as of 1970, collecting USD 35 million only on royalties per year., , Musical in bright colors and irreconcilable shades tells about a ""tribe"" of people who share a sense of anti-war sentiment, and who wanted to end the war as quick as possible. The contribution of a show has invested in the early completion of The Nam War, because its songs have been used widely as a part of the culture of the movement against this war. In addition to this postulate, the show exploited the idea of the sexual revolution, which has been quite a turbulent river in the US in 1960-1970 years. It is also a politically active plot of human beings, which affects the themes of racial segregation and war for independence, plurality of embedded elements of the hippie culture, as well as the struggle between the generations of fathers & children. Diverse, multi-faceted musical, also founded a place for personal choice, education of the child, conceived from unknown person, and the choice between rebellion and humility., , Hot topics of nudity and drug use caused a storm of debates, revolving around the histrionics. But it is the most fair to listen to a view of hippies, who considered the nakedness not only as a protest against the banning of society, but also as a symbolism of openness to the world and to each other, as the contemplation of beauty and of divine creation, as an act of unity with nature, as an opportunity to revere physical beauty rather than to blame and to hide it."
"175","Hairspray ","    Young and cheerful Tracy Ternblad is a vivid example of the power of the spirit and of a positive attitude. She does not get upset about her overweight, old-fashioned hairstyle, or not enough expensive clothes. Tracy opens the edges of perception that were relevant at all times and in all countries: we must be able to accept and love ourselves, believe in what you do, so others treated you differently, depending not only on external beauty., , The author of the original film, John Waters, possesses quite eccentric views on the world. His other films were not as well known, as the works themselves were designed for a different stratum of society, not falling into the scopes of the mainstream, which, however, did not prevent him to create this picture. Each character, created by him, is unique and has vivid characteristic colors. There are no slack in the story, the transition from one event to another goes swiftly, but smoothly and correctly, and that rejoices., , Staging quite subtly and sarcastically reveals to the audience the shortcomings of society, and makes fun of them. This applies not only to the problem of adolescentâs uncertainty and belittling of differing from the crowd (fat, poor, ugly), but also the division of people on the white-skinned and black-skinned, with the discrimination of the latter ones. The main character is not a model from the cover, managed to become the idol of many, showing that the main thing is honesty, kindness and talent. That important for people is to understand that ""to be loved"" is not identical ""to be perfect in everything""., , The show included a lot of humorous moments that lead to pull the lips into a smile and leaving a pleasant precipitate. The music deserves special attention. It is memorable, vivid, relevant at all times good old rock'n'roll is pleasantly mellifluous and generally fits the mood, which the creators wanted to show. We are glad also that in the musical (as well as in re-done film of 2007) they decided assign a man on the role of the main character motherâs. Harvey Fierstein perfectly coped with this task, revealing at the scene own character not worse than the bohemian Divine, Harris Glenn Milstead, on the screen., , The musical, like the film, has collected a large amount of positive feedback and enthusiastic comments as the picture, in which all the evils of society are exposed to light funny and in totally unobtrusive way."
"176","Hallelujah, Baby! ","    Nowadays the question of discrimination doesn't seem for people so sharp. But last century it was a serious problem for black people. However, there were those, who could achieve recognition of others, thanks to their talent, commitment and charm. One of such heroines is Georgia. This is a girl, who is dissatisfied with her situation. And in spite of the fact that the mother tells her to adopt the provision and to be content with what she has, Georgia dreams to become the best. It is an incredibly resistant character. Despite of all difficulties, a girl goes forward. And the actress who played this role faultlessly, could report the character of this girl. Fervent, cheerful â she arouses only positive emotions. The mother of the heroine isn't less dear. Though their relationships with daughter are not completely opened, the viewer understands that both of them are the strong women, going through life with a smile. They are ready to support each other in any hard minute., , But the most intriguing part of a plot is, of course, relationships of Georgia, her boyfriend and her true friend. First, this love triangle is capable to attract the viewer with its versatile male roles. Boyfriend Clem is a black guy, as Georgia. As nobody else, he can understand the girl because he gets under influence of public prejudices. But at the same time, a guy is also a contrast of Georgia as he doesn't see an exit from current situation, unlike Harvey, who is a constant moral support for Georgia. The aspiration to the purpose is the quality of characters that unites them. The idea to show Georgia, her mother and Hervey as ""forever young"" won't leave the audience indifferent. It symbolizes eternal love to life, despite all failures and internal youth of the soul. , , According to some critics, there are political and racial hints in the show. Nevertheless, having watched the performance, viewers will understand that this musical, on the contrary, opens the topic about that all people are equal. This kind of show will be suitable for wide audience. The technical part of the musical is also noteworthy: the scenery design is bright and various. Suits are bright, first of all, because of variety or Georgiaâs ârolesâ. Choreography is also at the top level. Overall, the show deserves all the awards that it has got. The musical is worth watching. This is a history about how it is important not to lose courage and to find happiness in small things. It teaches people to remain unique persons under any conditions and irrespective of race."
"177","Hamilton ","    Hamilton is a modern example of a successful musical performance. It appeared on stage in the middle of the summer of 2015 and up to now collects positive feedbacks. Thundered glory of this theatrical is not accidental: a good direction, an incredible combination of classic and modern trends, coupled with the performance of the actors is so alive that you donât even believe that it causes them any difficulty. It does not say that the musical is incredibly expensive in terms of scenic decoration and design, because it takes place on a fairly simple stage, with not the most sophisticated decorations, deprived of enchanting brilliance. Costumes on the actors rather simple also, without frills, but clearly & quite frankly transfer and the idea that was originally put into, and the spirit of the time., , Humanity. Humanness and this, as it may seem at first glance, simplicity, gives a stunning result. We are glad that the plot and music has not slacks or overloads with events, allowing to plunge into the story completely. From the first chords of sounding, attention is riveted to what is happening on the stage, and does not allow to escape for a moment. It is impossible to want to do something else, because the plot on the scene becomes something so alive and independent, that it is wanted to immerse in it completely., , As all the Founding Fathers, black actors were selected, doing an excellent job with their roles in the play. The transitions from one musical style to another arenât smooth, which anoints a charm throughout the event. Miranda is surprising. Its role in the musical is unique: he alone is a leading actor, composer, author of the play, lyrics, co-producer and co-director. In the history of Broadway, it is one of the rarest cases. May the show be designed for fans of hip-hop, but this does not prevent it to be adored unconditionally even by not the fans of the genre. Originality, brilliant directing, outstanding music, and glitter of decorations. What will happen if you take it all away? A good story of a strong personality remains, one of the great leaders of the country, drawing attention to the important things, like the past., , Hamilton was nominated for 40 different awards, amongst which took 27, including Outstanding Musical, Best New Musical and Outstanding Music. The play was nominated even for Grammy-2016 as Best Musical Theater Album. Tour performances in the United States were planned, estimated beginning â 2017. There is no doubt that it will be successful."
"178","Happiest Girl in the World","    There is the ambivalent impression from this play. On the one hand, before the eyes appears the classic comic story based on ancient Greek literature, and on the other â the inept performance and reading. The musical, which should reveal the irony and humor of the problems of war and sex, revolves around its ubiquitous director -âCyril Ritchard. He played several roles in it, separating oneself from the rest of the actors, frantically pulling the blanket, which, for the guarantee of the success, had to be properly distributed amongst each participant correctly and evenly. Ritchard apparently did not think of it, too much wanting to put himself on public. Leaving oneself also the main male role in the musical (the villain Pluto, which in one of the scenes try to seduce a beautiful Lysistrata and to make her to give up the rebellion), he tries even there to outshine everything that happens on stage with his character. , , Of course, in productions like these, always a character is required, who will focus on himself, allowing events to flicker easier and to smooth all corners of the plot, if any. Suffice to recall very popular in those days production A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum and the main character of this production, slave Pseudolous, which, obviously, was the lead in the plot, but served extremely competently and in harmony. Which, unfortunately, the director of this play was unable to achieve., ,  The second obvious reason for the lack of success of this staging was an attempt to make the music accompaniment too typical for those years. When the motives are already ingrained even in each random stone, falling under a show sole on Broadway. Yip Harburg wanted to match the pattern of Offenbach too much and either overdone either was tiresome for Broadway audience., ,  However, despite the unfortunate production and the fact that musical was not able to take a firm stand on Broadway, it was recorder pretty well. Voices of actors perfectly conveyed the emotions and mood. On the disc, musical sounds really good, many fans of 60s call it classic."
"179","Happy Days ","    The modern theater has a tendency to cause nostalgic feelings in the viewersâ hearts. The creators revived the series that made the audience in 70-s enjoy and embodied them on a scene. It is possible to tell that it has turned out to be quite successful. The producers managed to choose the brightest plot lines and images, which were remembered by people, thanks to the series, and to gather them in a whole, having turned the show into a stream of pleasant memories. Of course, it is impossible to put the whole series in a couple of hours on the stage. For this reason, admirers of the series can be critical to the musical. Someone will miss his favorite lines, which have remained unmentioned in the show. But in any case, the musical won't leave anybody indifferent. Especially if a viewer is an admirer of series, the performance is worth watching. At least, the comparison of a TV show and musical is quite interesting., , The story is about young people and their families of the 50-60s years. Of course, it would be nothing without the spirit of that time. And, as always, it impresses the audience very much., , First of all, it was reflected in design of the performance. Bright suits are evident. Magnificent colorful dresses put on girls, clothes of ""hooligans"" and ""cool guys"" put on boys â all these things don't allow a viewer to miss them due to their variety. Sometimes the audienceâs eyes don't even know what to glance for., , Light and scenery designs are also made on the top-levels and allow plunging into the atmosphere of that time. The only thing that it is possible to carp at is vocal. Sometimes the actors don't cope with their parties. But it is compensated by the excellent choreography. What about the audience that could like the musical, it may consist of both the adults, who are familiar to the series, and young boys and girls, who have never heard about it. The only advice, which can be given to the young audience, is to get acquainted with a plot in advance, because it is possible to get confused in this variety of actors. , , By the way, transformation of one of the heroines can surprise old admirers of the series. Merion will turn from an ordinary housewife into a modern woman. In general, the performance leaves only positive impressions. At least, it is very courageous and interesting attempt to embody the screen version on a scene. For everyone, who wants to enjoy the atmosphere of the middle of the last century, to feel ""command spirit"", to be delighted by good humor, or even to remember the youth, the musical âHappy Daysâ will be a good choice."
"180","Happy End ","    How many stories as such has the world seen? You can even remember the famous ""Guys and Dolls"", produced in the same era. Broadway is full and flooded with such ideas and, alas, not all of them are worth a tenth part of the attention of the public. This is one of such examples., , Musical gave critically small number of exhibitions, collecting avaricious public, probably because of low tickets prices. Perhaps due to the fact that it was a kind of attempt to revive the idea that was born in the distant 1920s, when this histrionics was shown in Europe. But even then it did not have any success, revealing just seven hits at the first round of play and authors, hiding under pseudonyms, did not recognize their child. Perhaps, this could be assessed as a bold attempt to create something different, somewhat original. According to some critics, whose articles were flashed in the newspapers, it was not as bad as it was felt by the same New York Magazine, which in May 1977 gave a very unflattering opinion about this theatrical., , There were opinions (e.g., Pittsburgh Post Gazette, in July 1977), that the production might be a bold throw on Broadwayâs stage, with a good chance of success, as actors were hideously sincere and could make a sweet candy out of this, along with biting sarcastic remarks that might win the audience. Practice, unfortunately, proved otherwise. Not all ideas deserve a place under the bright rays of spotlights on Broadway., , Confronting the Salvation Army and mobsters was a popular theme of that time. Especially when a young girl, chaste and pure, falls in love with the bastard on the other side of the barricades. So here, Bill lays the path of corrections, which is for the love of his lady and he is ready to go through fire, water and copper pipes. Lillian is a beautiful girl, the naive and the perfect romantic character with antagonistic outlook on life. Their union within the context of squabbles of criminal gangs and the army is completely canonical example of the struggle between light and darkness, and the reconciliation of opposites by means of the only true weapon â love."
"181","Heathers ","    Probably everyone had a school love. At such times, it seems that no circumstances can separate the lovers, and feelings will last forever. Especially when things are not going well and it seems that the whole world is against you. Adolescence not in vain considered to be the most difficult age for any relationship, but also the most important for gaining socialization skills, generally defining the social role of the individual in the community. This story shows the true drama of teenage life in the school, an unfair division, according to the hierarchy and humiliation, through which the children have to undergo during this period., , Qualities of the most ""coolest"" ones ridiculed pretty tough, obvious dreams of rogue ones exhibited, about which they are always silent. Did someone ever, being unjustly humiliated by stronger, want to revenge with cruelty? Of course, did. This histrionics shows the consequences of such, opens all the madness, raging in a young and still fragile minds of teenagers. Character of Veronica Sawyer shows us the difficult road and a hard choice between right and wrong, pangs of conscience against the craving for revenge. Justice is turned inside out, turning this into the theater of the absurd, with which Veronica has to fight afterwards. And the hardest thing for her that this ""justice"" is the embodiment of her beloved, new boy, appeared in the school recently., , The duo made of B. W. Weed & R. McCartan looks very sensual and heartfelt. At some point, it begins to seem that they do not play, but live their lives on stage, which is captivating. Their voices sound harmoniously worked out, ideally revealing the characters in the songs. The musical is very bright and lively, this production is very successful attempt to revive and to put on music the old story, shown on television in 1988. The main thing is that this subject does not cease to be relevant over the years. Yes, it is really fascinating, thrilling and boils the blood â all the items of true interest are present here. Of course, many will love this spectacle."
"182","Hedwig And The Angry Inch ","    The components of the successful musical are known to everyone. They are famous actors, music, which can win the hearts, interesting, but at the same time, simple plot, good and clear final and also beautiful scenic design. What are the components of ""Hedwig and Ill-fated Inch""?, , To tell that the plot is uncommon means not to tell anything. It is not beaten ""American dream"", and not a ""tearful drama about a difficult life of gays"" at all, as it can seem at first sight. It is a tragicomic story of life told in a fancy, but fascinating form., , A drama about talented blond knave, who is searching for her love, is presented to the viewer's attention. Sarcasm and irony are felt from with the first seconds (the song about America â the beautiful country, sounds in other context). The set of the effects, which visually enrich the show, is used., , Hedwig is he and she, the creator and the victim, love and hatred, good and evil, unity and conflict of opposites. Itâs worth telling about the actors. Of course, acting of main performers impresses most of all! Incredibly talented, John plays organically and sensually in each scene. Other actors are also picked up ideally, there is no such feeling, as if the director didnât finish any role. Everything is remembered: the cheerful manager of the group, the sergeant (""sugar daddy"") and a strange girl in black. Members of the collective are bright characters, souls and bodies of whom are devoted to the leading singer., , Now, some words about music. Low bow! Never thought that the music written for such kind of musical can become so amazing! Only a vocal composition ""Origin of Love"", for which the charming animation insert was made in the show, is worthwhile., , What else can please a viewer? Of course, it is a reference to the well-known philosophical works. For example, fragments from Plato plays a big semantic role in the plot. You might think: how the history about the boy, dressed up in vulgar clothes, decorated as ""moth"", can cause positive feelings? This phenomenon stays misunderstood, but the fact is the musical is impregnated with a certain magic; the intimacy, with which Hedwig tells a story of his life, attracts; music remains in the head. After watching the performance, you come back to a sad story about Hensel with the help of the songs., , Here, in general, everything deserves attention, but there is only one queen â Hedwig. Where will searches of the other half lead her to? Is it possible to understand and accept yourself, as you are, your talents, mistakes and failures? As well as Hedwig, this musical is a fine life collage. And the main thing about it, that you want to reconsider it."
"183","Hello, Dolly ","    Vivid and memorable musical of mid-twentieth years of past century, called the ""golden era of musicals"", from its sunset. As each classic musical, special and deep meaning is absent here. This is a nice story about love, wealth and about the difficulties of time, when no one needed prolonged and serious dramas, especially on Broadway. Weightless story, pleasing the eye and reveals comedy to the audience, bold with brilliant costumes and decorations on a wide stage., , Of what woman dreams, if not of love and wealth? This histrionics shows that men require exactly the same two components in order to gain a complete harmony between self and the outer world. Harsh and rigorous Horace is gently amenable to quirky charms of cunning Dolly. Delicate and sensual Irene and simple romantic Cornelius are here also. Even the story line initially tells that young men need only money and a light veil of women's perfumes on clothing after short entertainment, leads to the subject of serious feelings. And it did not load the plot, allowing not to think and not to feel uncomfortable beholding. Simple and not vulgar humor finely contributes to this performance., , In the role of Dolly, Carol Channing looked beautifully and very well, who was able to convey very clearly the nature of her playâs character, and she never missed a single performance during three years, but after she had to leave the production. After that, the director appointed the role of Dolly to not less famous actresses, including Betty Grable (she has become the most well-known Dolly of all times, reviving this spectacle very much), Ginger Rogers, Pearl Bailey & Martha Raye., , The musical was very popular, tickets for it literally flew away, newspapers were full of articles about it, and critics were drastically thrilled. The sincerity and simplicity of this story bribed thousands of beholders, and the excellent performance of actors has not gone unnoticed, especially of the stars of the time, such as David Burns as Horace or Eileen Brennan as Irene. It gave a special charm to posters, additionally assuring the quality of the play., , The same-named film was shot in 1969, in which the main role was acted by unsurpassed Barbra Streisand. It attracted even more attention to this production., , Popular newspapers like The New York Times, illuminated the histrionics several times, each time leaving a lot of positive reviews. For example, Walter Kerr wrote: Hello, Dolly! is a musical comedy dream. Very often, the female lead, Carol Channing, was praised, noting her incredible talent, voice and excellent act. Notable was a moment in the history of the musical, when after four years of running the productions on Broadway, ticket sales began to fall, David Merrick came up with an unusual way to update the musical and to return its former popularity: he replaced the entire troupe with black actors. The main role was after the famous actress Pearl Bailey, and in the background was playing now a famous Hollywood star â Morgan Freeman. Londonâs West End took the show on the stage of Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in December 1965 and it closed only after 794 spectacles."
"184","High Fidelity ","    Sometimes it seems to people they have everything that is necessary for happiness. Itâs your own favorite little musical shop, a girlfriend, and friends, who share your interests. But when something begins to go wrong, a person thinks, what his or her fault is. And it can sometimes lead to the unexpected conclusions and completely change the destiny. Rob Gordon is the clodhopper without money and aspiration in life. It doesn't prevent him from putting on ugly clothes, tormenting his six ex-girlfriends, being eternally dissatisfied, hanging out with a couple of cranky music lovers, and, at last, meeting the dawn in his bed with an exotic American singer. But this image of the music lover, who has neglected his life in the past, attracts by its sincerity. The music and love, filling his life with sense, resist to the world of money and eternal cares of success. The internal romantic in the soul of the hero wins the heart of the audience. He is constantly arguing about what has become the first reason: the dependence on sentimental music or his depression because of another failure in love?, , A good job of the designer of scene and the costumier should be also noticed. With their help, the atmosphere of that time, in which the novel has been written, is perfectly transferred. The soundtracks of the performance are rich and various. It's a remarkable selection of music from different times! The show is simply impregnated with various names of the groups and performers, whose names will become a revelation for many people. Itâs not just a beautiful ornament. It's a counter, a way to create a mood of the viewers, to express emotions and experiences of the characters. Sometimes they are silent, but the music speaks in place of them. This puzzle, developing together in accuracy, coincides with the atmosphere of musical bits and rhythms of life from the pages of the novel. But the musical has also one big disadvantage. The book is organized in such way, that the evolution of the character and his principles are traced by each of Rob's ex-beloveds, whom he remembers. The scenario was made as if the book was broken into pieces. The creators have rearranged chapters and pages, they have added humor. Thatâs why a viewer keeps tracking the road, which Rob moves, being gradually improved. In general, the show is worth watching, at least because there is a surprising variety of great musical hits in it."
"185","High School Musical 2 ","    What can happen after a year of studying at school? Of course, a fine summer! If the viewers want to watch the movie about rest and entertainments or even simply spend time cheerfully, then they are welcome! , , The vacation is coming, and the guys think about where to go to earn some money. The main meanie of school â Sharpay Evans â comes back to the old ways. Foreign success and happiness haunts her. This time ""the first beauty of school"" decided to set a love couple â Troy and Gabriela, by the ears in a hope to incline the guy to participate in the competition, acting together with her., , The movie is so remarkable, kind and fantastic, that the whole world changes under the influence of these songs, sounding in the movie. What can be better than vacation, moreover, when it is spend with friends? However, the plot is quite beaten. Love of a clever girl and nice guy, intervention of silly, but quite talented blonde, an attempt to take this Mr. Popularity away, his atonement of fault and forgiveness. Of course, ""everyone lived happily"". It already bothers. There are not any originality and unpredictability, as always. Is it interesting to watch the movie, when you foreknow, who will be dating with whom and who will be left with nothing? And the history isn't connected with the title ""High School Musical"" in any way. Nevertheless, the audience, most likely, won't expect a serious drama from the musical. If their purpose is to enjoy the bright picture and to spend time with smile, then this movie is recommended for them., , Music and dances are excellent concepts of summer! There is a wish to sing, dance and fall in love in summer! Therefore, everything is present at this movie and gives the viewer the full presence and feeling of reality. But it is a pity that in the real world, good things happen not so often. There is only one oversight in many Disney's movies, including this: everyone begins to dance and sing suddenly! It looks a little silly. And what the main thing is, all the students learn the words and movements at once, and the music unexpectedly flows from somewhere, and a viewer can hardly understand, what's happening. But hey, it is a musical, after all, give it a chance!, , The summer in the movie is shown perfectly. Everything is presented, including pools, bright sun, green lawns, games and the sea of pleased smiles on everyone's faces. After watching the movie, there is a wish to run out on the street and to enjoy all the delightful credits of the summer. Despite some disadvantages, the movie became better. The second part is very cheerful. There are more songs than in the first one. Actors have matured. It's very pleasant to watch, how they develop in the eyes of a viewer. In general, this is a worthy sequel, which can definitely be advised for family watching."
"186","High School Musical 3 ","    It must have happened. End of school life is such a logical conclusion of the movie! Now a viewer will know who everyone will be., , This movie was created with the main focus on dances. It moves away from the realism. The tinted backup dancers unexpectedly appear from nowhere. Fancy-dressed scenes are very rich; the scenery is difficult. The scenario becomes naiver (heroes sing while staying alone. They sing on the trees, on a carpet, eating strawberry, and so forth). Songs and dances become not just an expression of feelings to each other, but also a mentality. At the beginning of the movie, there is an episode, where Troy Bolton faints for a second, and at this moment, he appears to be a participant of a scene, where Gabriella sings to him, and he also answers her with the song. There is also a scene, where Troy sings alone at an empty school, telling about his feelings. The movie has already stopped being just about the musical, it has become the musical itself. And it is necessary to appreciate it for that now. It is already another measure. It is a ready statement for Broadway, it is a performance. And at the performance, a viewer shouldn't be confused about that the lock is drawn, and the parts of the kingâs clothes consist of gauze. This is because there is no realism here, but a pretty picture. We see the play, the talent of actors, their identity and relationships of the characters. It is much more important. And in this way, the movie is successful more than ever., , The plot, as usual, is quite simple. Everyone faces a choice: some people have already decided, the others still think, and someone wants to change a long-term decision only now. Sharpay has the last chance to take Troy away and become a school star. Troy can't choose college as he wants to be with Gabriella, but doesn't want to give up basketball and theater. Gabriella faces the choice too: Troy or the dream of her mother. And Ryan, will he be a shadow of his sister or will he prove himself?, , The actors are charming. Zac and Vanessa played remarkably, their love lit up every time with a new force. Ashley is very pleasant in this part. Of course, she has matured, as her heroine. And she doesn't irritate as in the second part, where she had ""lovely pranks"". Lukas Grabeel, at last, has proved himself. The play of Olesya Rulin is also amazing. She has got prettier, as well as her heroine., , It is a pity that the audience won't see this team together anymore â there will be no 4th part. But after all, it is right that the producers have finished the musical on this. It is such a logical conclusion of the story about their life together. This is a worthy farewell of the viewers to the actors they have fallen in love with."
"187","High School Musical ","    The first part of the magnificent musical trilogy opens an image of the main characters of the musical. By means of the songs, a viewer percepts Troy and Gabriella's feelings. It is that strange occurrence, when disadvantages become supremacies. All the excessive emotionality turns into benefit, when you get used to it. , , The plot is simple and has no special value. Itâs a love story about school life of ""ordinary"" students with their problems and troubles. Observing it is quite dullish, especially, when all the twists of the plot are terribly predictable. The movie has a lack of intrigue, unless there are small turns of the plot closer to the final. The moral is quite simple: it is necessary just to work and enjoy your life. Before meeting Gabriella, the most cherished dream of Troy was a victory in the basketball championship. However, since the moment they have met in karaoke on a New Yearâs party, Troy can't reject a thought about casting for the main role in the school musical with Gabriella with the main female role! Gabriella overcomes sets of obstacles too. Her help is simply necessary for a scientific school team, but she wants to sing with Troy again., , Some words about actors: Vanessa Hudgens managed to show all feelings of her heroine, and Zack Efron has shown what a difficult choice Troy has faced. In general, all the actors and actresses were perfectly picked up. Their voices excellently sound in songs. Plenty of attributes to the musical in all the moments amuse the audience, for example, how the main characters sing as pop stars. And it isn't necessary to speak about the scene with basketball match. But if you get used to it, the movie becomes very pleasant. Or, if you are a teenager, there is nothing to use to, because this is your life. , , A director of the motion picture is K. Ortega, who is one of the best directors in this genre. Once he presented the magnificent movie ""Hocus-pocus"". It is, of course, not his best movie, but it is quite amazing. Sustaining all the picture in the style of traditional musical is an unexpected decision. Energizing melodious songs and unusual dances throughout the entire musical don't allow coming off the screen. There is a wish to jump there and to dance together with the students., , Considering the budget of only USD 4.5 million, the creators have overcome all the expectations, which could be laid upon the movie of such genre. Excellent acting of the young actors creates the feeling of a global holiday, just like Disney always does."
"188","High School Musical On Stage ","    It turned out to be worthy continuation of the viewersâ favorite musical on a scene. The show appeared to be quality and professional. Bright heroes, interesting plot are still its main features. Dancing and music performances are amazing, and sports are at the top too, though in the original film, there are less of them. There is a set of ridiculous episodes, amusing hints in the plot, but it is not trite. All these things are as they have to be. And it pleases. Now, some words about the plot. The fact that two heroes, a basketball player and a chemistry-genius girl decided to become friends and to go to the audition, leads to the mass of misunderstanding. Moreover, their choice isn't approved in the beginning and is even derided by their friends. But it is important to make such a step, if you really want and if it is your dream, even at the cost of friendsâ loss. , , By the way, some words about the friends. They turned out true ones, because they don't leave the main heroes. The guys understood them and their decision and even helped Gabriella and Troy. Then protagonists turn into a couple â self-assured Troy and a modest girl Gabriella. All the characters are very light, kind and iridescent. Even the main negative character Sharpay doesn't irritate at all and, on the contrary, causes affection. The cast is young; there isnât any bored person, which is an additional advantage of the performance. As it has been told above, dances are at the top level. There are no mistakes, everything is accurate, just ideal! What impresses most of all is the moment, when all the school dances. It was really grandiose!, , There is a wish to tell special thanks to the decorator and costumiers. The design of a scene and dresses of the students were remarkable. Everything was very bright and immersed into the atmosphere of carefree youth and a general holiday. The musical teaches us some good things in life, true friendship and love, persistence in the achievement of purposes and the ability to be yourself. Therefore, it should be watched by everyone. It isn't necessary to perceive the show as the musical, which is created only for children and teenagers. It is suitable for the wide audience. In general, everything appeared to be beautiful and positive. After the performance, the thought ""Dances rules the world!"" won't leave a viewer for a long time. Of course, there is a part of truth that almost all Disney productions are naive, predictable and everything has a happy end, but it is so pleasant to watch!"
"189","High Society ","    Many years later, after a premiere of ""Philadelphian Story"" was released, one more musical version of this play appeared. It was bright and fervent, as well as the majority of the musicals, based on the books of those years. High society contains: luxury, smart houses, cars, continuous receptions and parties. To get to high society is a dream for many inhabitants. They think that entertainment and rest wait for them. All these things are a shelter of idlers. Nevertheless, a number of people wishing to visit the high society at least once doesn't become less now, as 50 years ago. , , But behind all this facade and carefree life, there are the same human passions. How to choose the man, with whom you will be happy for many years? How not to lose him? Such questions have risen before Tracey Samantha Lord, the daughter of the rich and respectable owner of the firm. Having married Dexter Heaven, the neighbor from not less respectable sort, she was not attracted with his work of the crooner. Being dissatisfied with prospects of this marriage, she chose a new groom for herself, George, who operates the firm of her father. Blinded by opportunities and status, she didn't notice the romantics of life with Dexter and their true love at all. But a plain reporter Mike Connor, who does not understand the lifestyle of high society at all, opened her eyes. Tracey falls in love with him. For the young girl, who is searching for both the status and romantics, it will be very difficult to get out of this love quadrangle., , Not every woman will cope with such a difficult role. And the actress, who has been chosen for a leading role, is more suitable for this part than anybody else. A viewer will be struck by a duet of two main characters: Tracey and George. The owners of fine velvety voices decorate this simple, cheerful musical with the songs, which are not less beautiful than the actors. It is difficult not to mention the song ""True Love"", where Tracey sings in a duet with Dexter. A viewer will be also surprised by good vocal skills of Dina. And of course, it is not possible to forget about a jazz musician playing Mike, whose orchestra accompanies such fine voices., , The musical can't brag of the rich scenery. All the actions happen on the territory of the house, which belongs to Tracey's uncle. But even this location was very detailed and transferred the atmosphere of luxury. The shortage of varieties in the scenery was compensated by the costumes: the costumier really worked hard here! The feeling of presence amongst luxury and wealth will definitely not abandon a viewer. Of course, the most beautiful dress in this performance is a wedding dress of Tracey. The audience will be pleased by a magnificent woman in mesmerizing attires., , Certainly, this amazing performance will be excellent pastime for those, who adore jazz music or just want to have a rest and receive the portion of good mood, positive, and romantics. And of course, for those, who want to plunge, at least for a couple of hours, into the carefree atmosphere of High Society."
"190","Honk ","    Unfortunately, it happens very often that we judge people by their outward appearance. We frequently forget that our hearts and souls are much more important than this outer picture of âfaÃ§adeâ. This fact makes other people suffer. They start thinking they are worse than the others are and cannot be loved. , , Ugly was the one, who has been neglected from his childhood. People were laughing at him, while his own parents didnât pay attention to his being. It made him separated. And he finally believed a bad guy â the Cat. It is so common in our life. People get into so-called bad companies, because they need to have a feeling of belonging to anything., , When Ugly disappears, we see how everyone start to worry. Even the mother understands that she misses him a lot. All the characters hope to find him and regret they have been so cruel. Real life is the same. We understand the importance of people only when we finally lose them., , However, there are also positive moments in the show. The main thing is, of course, a happy end. Everyone loves it, even if it is not very true to life. Besides, there are lots of lessons, of which the musical can teach us. For example, it is necessary to remember that appearance is not the major thing in a person. Moreover, we cannot love somebody only for his or her visual look. We need to know people better. Another essential thing is to believe in yourself. Everyone deserves to be loved. And it does not matter how different you are. And the last, but not the least â everyone must be able to forgive, as we all make mistakes., , The show is worth watching by all means. It is not only the plot, but also wonderful songs and actorsâ talent attract the attention of the viewers. If you want to see a beautiful, thoughtful story with deep sense â âHonk!â is just what you need."
"191","How the Grinch Stole Christmas ","    The first thing that strikes in this Christmas musical is the fantastic town Whoville, where ridiculous little men live. Rick Baker deservedly received ""Oscar"" for the special make-up effects, if to talk about a movie, not stage development. They live near the high mountain, at the top of which, in a cave, evil and opposite Grinch arranged his dwelling. It is possible to treat Jim Carrey differently, but it is necessary to recognize his virtuosity anyway. In this musical motion picture, he continues to please a viewer. Of course, under a thick layer of make-up, it is difficult to recognize the actor at once, but after a while, looking at the mimicry, which is already familiar since ""Mask"", and on the delightful mad energy of Grinch, it is already difficult to be mistaken that it is Jim Carrey., , The music is very pleasant. It transfers the adult audience to the childhood and creates a fantastic atmosphere of magic. It isn't even necessary to argue about the musical orientation on a little viewer. It seems, in the film and in the stage production, nobody does anything reprehensible, except for one fragment, in which Grinch eats a glass bottle. An adult viewer may see nothing fascinating, except the fairy tale with a doubtful ""lesson"". But, at the second glance, it is about the spirit of Christmas and very much Thanksgiving day, although the latter isnât present in the revealed topics. Why? Because we often judge people without knowing their inner world, only by their outward appearance. Grinch in the end realizes that he is a good guy and so the fellows from the town do., , Even the skill of make-up artists Rick Baker and Gail Rowell-Ryan, who, by the way, received Oscar for their work in this movie, strikes, but only for a while. It is because almost all the residents of the town are monotonous. If saying of the stage version, there are much lesser amount of make-up and more entertaining additions., , There are a lot of dialogues and the off-screen author's text in the musical. Perhaps, thatâs why children understand almost everything that occurs in the movie, despite a tongue twister of dialogues and the dynamism of the narration. In spite of repellent appearance, Grinch is pleasant to children. And something terrible or frightening doesnât present in the movie. Most likely, only adults will pay attention to the work of the director, acting and scenery props men work. Little children are too naive for such things. It is enough for them only to believe in a plot. And the film-making crew managed to embody it. What else is necessary for the children's fairy tale?"
"192","How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying ","    It's an amazing comedy musical! Here you can find magnificent acting, originally picked up suits, nice young actors and, eventually, unusual scenario. The plot line is quite simple: Finch is a young man of 27 years old, who has big desires and ambitions. He works as a window cleaner. Certainly, such state of affairs doesn't satisfy him. And once he finds a wonderful book, which and is called ""How to succeed in business, without doing anything"", appearing just in hands. Being inspired by it, he gets a job. Now he works in a big corporation as a clerk dealing with mail. All the plot develops quickly, but it is very correct and original. Finch meets Rosemarie, changes exactly two positions in two days â and in two weeks, he becomes almost a right hand of the boss. In the course of the musical, he falls in love, makes up his mind, tries to climb a career ladder in every possible way, and he is always lucky., , The musical is constructed on a subject, which is easy to guess according to the name, but all these things are shown without platitude, it is beautiful, like any Broadway performance. Everything in the performance makes us admire: original dances, suits, characters, simple comical songs and talent of actors., , This version of Broadway musical passes with minimum losses for scenic material. The producer, the director and the screenwriter, created something pleasant for perception, thoughtless and amusing and didn't lose the wit, which was the highlight of a Broadway version. Immersing a viewer into almost parallel world of corporate reality, which lives under the laws of everyday vanity, the director focuses all the attention on the main hero of the whole action â Finch. There is a separate word to tell about him. Itâs a nice Broadway actor. Besides, it is one of his best roles. Quite short, only 168 cm, he plays the most important role, and almost all the characters in the musical are taller than him, including his beloved Rosemarie. But this is the highlight. Finch, by the way, has a lot of ones: charming charisma, the acute facial expression, which he uses the best of all, a fine voice, plasticity of movements â everything in him is rather enchanting, a viewer falls in love with him from the first minute. In general, the movie fills with positive energy, romanticism, admiration and pensiveness for a whole day and nothing can spoil this mood. Itâs a worthy embodiment of the old musical and amusing book."
"193","I Do! I Do! ","    What is a musical for most of the viewers? First of all, it is a bright scenery, luring and memorable music, expensive suits and a enough number of dancers and actors. But with this musical, everything turned out absolutely different. In this performance, a viewer observes only two actors. But it only creates the magnificent nostalgic atmosphere of the spectacle., , The plot of the performance is extremely simple, but the director managed to present it in an unusual form. The audience sees a picture not as gradually developing plot. It is a reminiscence. They have to move into the past and really live this life together with the characters, becoming the main witnesses of their relations., , There is a wish to pay more attention to unsurpassed play of these actors. A viewer needs only to wonder, how they reincarnate on his or her eyes, become more senior from year to year. At first, it is an absolutely young couple, which in a line of consequences becomes elderly people. The actors managed not only to express all the romantic feelings brilliantly, but also to keep their tenderness and charm. It really fascinates., , First of all, this musical is intended for an adult audience. Of course, the young people will derive pleasure from this performance too. And it is possible that it will inspire them to search for a true love. Anyway, they will be touched by the events on a scene. But only those people, who have already lived a long period of time with their beloved and know, what a family life is, will be able to really estimate a performance. They will find something native and familiar for them in the musical. The adult audience will remember the youth, the birth and education of children, the crisis of middle age. It will force them to think about the characters as about themselves., , It is also worth thanking the author of this remarkable and romantic music, which sounds in the performance. Each song is filled with sense and love of heroes to each other. Even when they quarrel, a viewer understands that they just can't live separately. And all these things are perfectly transferred, thanks to the songs. In general, it is a remarkable musical for those, who don't wait for a great show. It is created especially for people, who want to relax and think about life and their darlings. The performance tells about the eternity and transience of time, which, despite its force, can't destroy true love., , This history will definitely not leave a viewer indifferent. There are no bright suits, big dramatic characters and rich scenery. But this musical will really stay in the hearts of those, who watches it. This show is about two soul mates, which pass through all the difficulties with pride and prove that true love really exists."
"194","I Love My Wife ","    Critics pointed out that the creators of the musical did what nobody before them â they took the musicians and carried them on the scene. Of course, the musicians played the music also â because it remains their work â but they were organically woven into the plot, in its development and even sang alone., , Is this musical unusual? Of course, because it is not just a play on the theme of bedâs hanky-panky, but the one, which involves four. Conceived is discussed easier than doing really, because in the whole process all the quartet of members become confused, some more, some less. To make love with the wife of your best friend? Interestingly, but in practice it's not only frankly scary, but also clumsy. A guy in trunks with coffee in bed? Cool too. , , Because of the topic, a lot of jokes are born, in which the characters show the entire emotional gamut, especially after the smoked exotic grass. But when it comes to the most important component â the one for which, in fact, all gathered, all the possible options of copulation, offered by a guide ""for beginners"", are consistently rejected. Common sense and ordinary human oppression takes over the raging passion that is proving to be a desire to get away from everyday dullness, routine in life itself, and not so much in its physical manifestations., , This musical has earned many accolades, among which the most unremarkable is: ""colorful, funny and juicy"". As you can see, the rest part is even more enthusiastic. No wonder that musical in 1977 won two Tonies and had 4 more nominations, received 3 Drama Desks, along with two additional nominations. 1977 was also marked by 1 reward of Theatre World and 1 nomination for Lawrence Olivier for the version in the West End., , Cy Coleman in 1977, together with M. Stewart, did a pretty bright satire on the sexual revolution of the 70s, moving us in the mid-class families, who bored with their everyday life, with its monotony, who wanted something wild, with a twinkle. Quite common theme for most of the theaters, in the musical format happened even funnier, because they could sing and dance, squeezing ridiculousness to every last drop out of the situation., , One of the participants says to the second that copulation with two women at least twice as sweet as with only one wife, probably hopes to sleep with his spouse. This is something we will never know, because until the thing itself it never came close, hiding behind all these verbal constructions, which being built around the upcoming interrelations. Persuasions of latest member happen already along the way as the other three are in full readiness, and it adds not only the spice and the severity to an event, but also a bunch of jokes of various levels., , We should also mention the work of costume designer â the atmosphere of 1970s has been passed very truthfully in dresses. Probably, it is the best work amongst all the stage design â everything is exactly as the average Americans wore these years. And you, if you dig into archives, will be able to find the same clothes on own photos of those times, if you were born somewhere between 1950sâ1960s., , In addition to the very lively voices of women and slightly more vivid expression of emotions than it should be, the audience also must enjoy easy, not over-abounding act, so after you get out of the hall, a good mood remains for a few days."
"195","I Love You Because ","    The musical became a tremendous interpretation of immortal classics. The musical, which is based on Jane Austen's novel âPride & Prejudiceâ, became a worthy modern embodiment of this work. Of course, the musical doesn't repeat the plot of the book completely. But the main idea of the novel, written by this writer, is transferred ideally. In the center of a plot, which is rather banal at first sight, are the relationships of two young couples. A heart of Austin, who writes verses for the cards, is injured. He finds out that his girlfriend makes a fool of him but can't forget her. The inability to leave the past prevents him from beginning the new relations with charming Mercy, who tries to help the guy in every possible way. Nevertheless, Marcy is very proud to date the guy, in whom she sees some shortcomings., , The Austin's brother, in his turn, looks after Marcy's friend. It turns out not unsuccessfully for him. But because of his prejudice that love relations can spoil friendship, he can't begin to live with her happily. What will put an end to misunderstanding of young people?, , Despite simplicity of the plot, it is very interesting to watch the actions and the development of the relations between the couples. The actors play very sincerely. In their acting, they excellently reflect those defects, which sometimes prevent people from living rich and happy life. The musical will be suitable for both youth and people of older age, because all the mistakes, which people can make during any period of their life, are shown here. As for dances and songs, they were made very professionally. What pleases most of all? Of course, the abundance of unusual, but, at the same time, romantic jazz compositions, which have recently become a rarity for Broadway musicals. Itâs possible to tell with confidence, that this music will keep a viewerâs feet tapping all the time, while s/he watches the show., , In general, ""I Love you because"" is a pretty comedy about love, with excellent jokes and high-quality technical part. If the viewers want to spend time easily and cheerfully, then this show is especially for them."
"196","I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change ","    What first catches the eye in this production â too extensive expression of emotions and rather exaggerated postures and gestures. It is a feature of all the actors, even those, who would have looked more natural with quieter gestures, like that fatty fellow in shirt and neatly ironed trousers. Music successfully emphasizes all the necessary emotional moments and ""sagging"" is underlined by pretentiousness moment of expectation, as, for example, in the song Stud And A Babe â when two people are trying to imagine what they would do if they were different people. But quite often the actors feed material, exaggerating the context of expressions too much, and that makes the play look like a mad joy of a puppy, whose owner came home, making it impossible to keep its tail from wagging. To be perfectly frank, sometimes it feels like whatever provincial amateur theater. However, the professional part in it is still there â it is the work of costume designer and illuminator. However, not all points of view can be reduced to this., , In the scene, when a girl is lamented with her spectacular playing-over her team-mate â a man â she wondered why he had never, for all their 4 meetings, tried to kiss her. And when he, as a result of confused explanations, gives birth to ""just wanted to be respectful"", it creates a very different emotional range â genuine interest in what will happen next, in what she will do and an enjoyable observation of her vivid attempt to pull the blanket over herself, if he is so indecisive, like the majority of men in real life are (not in their stories about own exploits). This scene is one of the most interesting in the musical. It includes real acting talent and no clumsiness in the texts and roles, everything goes very organically. The audience at some point even feels not as spectators but as voyeurs, who surreptitiously watching something really honest and gentle. But as a comic element still prevails, a very good joke is born at the junction of the of expectations of heroes â when she tells the guy that he should bring condoms at dinner, while he simultaneously sais about wine for the lasagna., , But, without singling out individual scenes, judging the musical as a whole, we must say that, first of all, it is organic because of transitions between roles. After 10 â 20 minutes of play, youâll leave aside all attempts to criticize somewhat bad moments in the game of actors, getting used to their clumsiness and laugh every few seconds, because this comedy is incredibly good. Yes, we agreed not to go into details, but the scene Satisfaction Guaranteed is a know-how in terms of humor birth â when, together with you in bed, there is a consultant, who will pursue you to achieve your satisfaction from intercourse and will monitor compliance with the signed contract, and then will write you a check if you or your partner will not reach the coveted points., , If you start watching this musical with a bad mood and the desire to criticize to the right and to the left, then the bright emotions, lively characters and excellent sense of humor will make you change your mood faster than you can say, ""Mississippi is distinguished with diversification""."
"197","If Then ","    Sometimes it is necessary for the person to make only one choice to change the destiny completely. All events in his or her life depend on the decisions and objects they set to themselves. And answer to question: ""Who to become? Beth or Liz?"" defines both pleasure and grief. This remarkable modern Broadway performance tells about it. It is about choices we make or decisions we hesitate to adopt. It is about âWhat would be?â kind of questions., , Creators have perfectly embodied idea of the musical on a scene. Besides the fascinating plot, the performance has an unusual form. It shows events of Elisabeth's life. She is divorced woman, who arrived to New York to begin new life. But now her life is divided into two parts: in one she is Beth, and in other â Liz. The viewer observes a destiny of one and then of other girl on a stage. And it is rather unusual and unpredictable. , , The fact that in case of the career choice, she finally meets her love Josh, is remarkable. When the woman chooses new acquaintances, she achieves success at work. By the means of such unexpected turn of events, creators wanted to show how the result can differ from the choice, which we make, and that sometimes everything can turn out on the contrary, even if we didn't wait for it. Life is much more facetted than we think., , Acting also deserves praise. The main actress faultlessly copes both with Beth's role, and with image of Liz. But anyway she remains Elisabeth, and it is important. A love story in the first part of the musical is touching and sad at the same time. The leading actor, who plays Josh, is able to give all feelings, which he has to the heroine., , The atmosphere of New York, with its skyscrapers, apartments is not less important, and it is perfectly transferred in the spectacular, thanks to the designer of a scene. Wardrobe is rather simple, but at the same time, minimalistic, modern and memorable., , Music in show is very different. The viewer can hear everything, beginning from slowly love ballads and finishing with fast rhythms. But nothing of them will leave the viewer indifferent., , The work of choreographer should be noted. All dances very professional. During a premiere, almost all places in the hall were occupied. The musical is for wide audience. The viewers from 16 years can come to a performance and get a great pleasure. , , In total, this is a dynamic performance with surprising scenery, tremendous actor's game, an interesting plot and choreography. Everyone, who finds an interest in the problem of vital choice and destiny, is obliged to watch this musical. It will be pleasant also to those who just love good music and a romantic plot. In any case â must see!"
"198","Illya Darling ","    If to carp at the plot, then it is possible to find a lot of cons and misunderstandings in it. For example, judging by the story, all prostitutes are very happy with their lives, which is truly far from reality. Secondly, married men constantly spend time in a tavern. It is unclear, where their wives are and why they are in that place all the time. What does Illya feel after the classes with Homer? All these remain unclear. , , It is also absolutely unknown, where the action takes place: in the hotel or at Illya's house? The authors don't concretize all these things and, thus, miss many details. But if a viewer is related to the Greek culture and loves everything that is made on the subject of this country, s/he will watch this plain musical with great pleasure. The simplicity of the plot, capricious beauty, romantic experiences and remarkable music â all these components are the main lines of the performance. , , At the heart of a plot, there is an aspiration of Homer to re-educate a prostitute named Illya â to direct her to the right path. That is because she is the embodiment of beautiful Hellas for him. But the aspiration of her new fellow doesn't mean anything for her. All young people want to love, to sing, to dance â to live a full life, belonging to today completely! , , It is a cheerful musical, filled with jokes and passions. It seems that the wisdom of modern Greeks consists in âliving now, living fastâ postulate. The Greeks don't plunge into questions of morals and searches of deep meanings. Illya knows the price of the youth and doesn't want to live differently. Itâs because her choice has already been made. Why to toil, if being better than you are, means playing a hypocrite? Everybody is different., , As for the music, it turned out to be rather original, because there are some Greek motives in it. They add original parts to all songs and become the distinguishing feature of the show, if this histrionics staged somewhere else, besides of Greece. Dances are also made at a high level. They are filled with passion and experiences. The fragile actress, playing Illya, is very graceful. Of course, there are many erotic scenes in the musical. Therefore, this musical isn't recommended to watch by people of younger age. Most likely, this show will be pleasant for the representatives of that times (1960s) and the fans of Greek culture. In general, the musical has appeared to be quite good, if not to go deeper into the plot â funny and eccentric. But it is better for a viewer to watch the movie at first, because there is a bigger accent on the meaning there."
"199","In the Heights ","    This story is about people from Latin America. They live in New York, but they have their own principles in life, their own problems & passions. The plot of the story attracts the audience. It is simple and interesting at the same time. The characters are really true to life. The viewers might see themselves in the heroes of the show., , Besides, it is not only the plot, but also the talents of the actors, which draw our attention to the musical. They managed to transfer the feelings and emotions of the main characters perfectly. Decorations and costumes are also quite impressive. , , Life is short and the heroes try to do everything they can. They make mistakes and change their decisions. But it is right, as we are not perfect. Everyone in the musical has his or her own dreams and desires. Look, for instance, at Usnavi, a man from the Dominican Republic. He thinks that he wants to come back to his homeland. But suddenly changes his mind. He understands that his home is right here. It teaches us that we cannot be attached to the place. We are attached to the people around us. We know them and start loving them. , , The songs, created for the sow, are extremely beautiful. They help to create that special atmosphere and allow the viewer to immerse into the life of the main characters. It is hard to find a person, who has watched the musical and did not like it. It makes us feel the same as the main characters do. Their voices, appearance and words â everything deserves the attention of the audience., , âIn the Heightsâ is something that is really mesmerizes and lures into the theatre. If you want to understand the hearts of Latin people â watch the musical and enjoy the talents of the actors."
"200","In Trousers ","    As many other modern people, Marvin has done everything that the others have expected from him. The main character got married and gave birth to a son. However, only after some time he starts to understand that he is not happy. The plot is, on the one hand, very close to real life. It is so, because we frequently do particular things just because the others do the same. But on the other hand, the issue of homosexuality is touched in this spectacle. It makes it pretty original performance. Some of the beholders may even say they do not support such topics. Well, if you are such type of a person, just pass this musical by. However, if you are ready to think deeper, to shut your eyes to the superficial issue of gender orientation and the prejudices connected with it â you will enjoy the show. , , Of course, it is not for people, who are ready to condemn anyone, who is not like them, but for the opposite ones â with open mind and heart and able to understand that all people have feelings. The story of the musical teaches up to accept the uniqueness of the others, and, what is more important, to accept ourselves. Nobody can change his or her nature after all. And there is only one choice â to be unhappy through all your life, following the prejudices of the surrounding ones, or to go against social standards and to live as you feel to be right. Marvin is the one, who has to make such a decision. His thoughts and feelings are perfectly transferred by the leading actor. In general, the acting is fascinating. It is hard to play, when all you need to show is emotions, not actions. But the actors managed to do it finely tuned., , One more thing, which attracts the attention of the audience is, of course, the music. William Finn made his best to build the whole story on it. The songs are wonderful and beautiful. You see no confrontation in the histrionics. All the Marvinâs transformations are displayed through the songs. We may say that the composer did a really great job! , , The show itself is quite extraordinary as well. And it is caused not only by the plot. In fact, there are no dialogues in the musical. It is even called a songs cycle. There are plenty of solos, duets, trios and even quartets in it. What is more interesting, even though the story is about non-conventional gender orientation, there are no other male characters here. The main hero only exhibiting on the stage. Such feature makes âIn Trousersâ very peculiar. , , There is an important metaphor in the center of the story. When Marvinâs schoolteacher offers him to be Columbus in a school play, she, so to say, sends him to discover the New World with other men. It is probably a critical moment for the main character, with which he starts his âjourneyâ and discovers his true aspirations, which he will examine only several years later., , Well, the musical is worth watching by all means. Everything â the plot, the actors, the costumes and music, is mesmerizing. All you need â is to agree with yourself that many issues, exist in the world, deserve to be revealed and youâll enjoy the show."
"201","Into the Woods ","    The interest to this musical rose again in 2014, when it was shoot as a filmed version, made by Walt Disney, with music by Stephen Sondheim, with such big stars like Meryl Streep (she received even an Oscar nomination as the Best Supporting Actress), Emily Blunt (which this year managed to be shot with Tom Cruise in the intellectual battle, megahit Edge Of Tomorrow), Chris Pine & Johnny Depp., , The vocals of all the characters were chosen bright, especially differently were shrilly womenâs, and most of all â Meryl Streep, a big fading star, but still phenomenally experienced actress who plays a worthy witch of all ages, and has no equal ones in this, it should be recognized., , This show is one of ""alive"" ones at the present time and was staged the last time a few days ago, in Ontario in 2016 with such a set of actors: M. Lacas, B. Hoover, C. Panth, M. Nash, H. Ritchie, C. Asuncion, A. Reed, E. Winsor, J. Peters, N. Banks, M. Shkvorets, R. Wood, J. King, S. Demitro, A. Swift, S. Harris, J. Sampa, K. Thomas-Smith & M. Bourke. J. Hutton was the director and M. Shuster was responsible for the choreography., , In this big epos, several short stories intertwined along with everything imaginable fairy tale, each of them having an alternative course and â most interestingly â nothing here ends with the words ""And they lived happily ever after"". Only the first act ends on this, but begins the second, no less fascinating. If the entire story was described a little more extensive than in the Synopsis section, encompassing all the details and storylines, especially in Act 2, it had to be extended for another 2-3 pages â so much of everything going on here. The viewer encounters a bunch of princesses and princes, some of which are relatives. The viewer learns that after the words of a long happy life in fairy tales everything is much more prosaic than you can imagine â not the endless balls and royal life, of which dreams every ordinary woman. All is proving to be a desire to hang out in nightclubs, infinitely change clothes and eat good food. That is, the reincarnation of basic desires in the world of rich kings. But in fact, all goes quite the opposite way â dresses come to an end; balls are filled with bunch of some people, wanting to entertain themselves as much as the princess with the prince, not showing nothing but ordinary individuality with Napoleon complexes and desire to stick a knife in your back as deep as possible to take your place. As for the food, according to the latest studies of historians of period of the true kings, the common people and noble persons were eating almost the same. And, as indicated by the film The Jewel Of The Nile with Michael Douglas, which starts just after ""they floated into the dusk to live happilyâ¦"", the most interesting things happen BEFORE this part, when all happily reunited in the end. This shows the beginning of the second act of this musical. At the same time, it is also replete with events and its distinctive feature is few interesting storylines develop, tighten and resolved."
"202","Irene ","    This musical is for those who not only loves old Hollywood and old Broadway, but actually remember what they were in 1950-1970 years. Sparkling dresses, complicated glossy evening hairstyles, elegant voices â velvety belonged to men and silky â to women. Where every sound was rehearsed for a hundred times to give the public the top of the ecstatic enjoyment of the show. Where the circumstances, in which shooting or setting was made, did not matter, as the main element was the show itself with its inalienable pipes and violin music, which is now only a nostalgic for those people, who are from the generation that caught the black-and-white films, laughed at the Chaplinâs jokes and wits, who empathized to Betty Grable, who listened with delight the voice of the young Sinatra. For all those who misses the bright long-gone days, when in cinemas appeared first short commercials with the new film Some Like It Hot with Marylin Monroe, which back in 1959 brought its creators fabulous USD 40 million. For all these people musical Irene is presented, the main force of which is the charm of old Hollywood and the old Broadway, as it was before the advent of musicals for 1 season, discounts on tickets up to 90% off their price, artificially increased number of exhibitions to 1000, 5000, 10 000 showsâ¦, , This is in what the power of Broadway â the show itself, made not by garments or by stage props men, but by the work of the actors, on the charm and charisma of which keeps the whole spectacle from start to finish. When the song begins, you are immersed in it so that you do not care about the endless feverish waves of financial crises, rolling inexorably across the planet, or do not care of the iron left turned on at home, because it will be filled by water from the tap, which has not been closed on the kitchen. When even the cover of the song inevitably brings to mind the image of the original artist â in this case, Debbie Reynolds (born in 1932 as Mary Frances Reynolds and now she is 83). Even Chordvettes, performing the melody with a modern twist, albeit with the maximum diligence to preserve the original sound, cannot spoil the mood, which was in this slow melancholic song tens of years ago. By the way, if you pause the clip of this group here in the video list, They Go Wild, Simply Wild, Over Me, at the 41 second â they'll all be frozen in poses like zombies., , In this production, in addition to the bright and encouraging reviews from the critics, well-deserved awards, for example, for the resurrection in 1973 â 1 Tony win & 3 more nominations, 1 win of Theatre World Award & 1 win of Outer Critics Circle Award. During the earlier productions, for example, in 1926, there is no data â such rewards havenât existed than (e.g., Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre, which is known to the general public as Tony, appeared only in 1947)."
"203","It's Only Life ","    The only musical instrument in all two dozen songs in a collection is piano. In the method of play of the composer feels the influence of genres Gospel and Rock, due to jerky and tranquil paces. Some scholars and critics can also say that in this play strongly felt the impact of the Stephen Sondheim, but it's more a matter of musical taste than is a firm fact. Because otherwise we can say that there is also the influence of Chopin, who also played, guided by notes. Everything is relative., , In addition to about the same tranquil blues-style of level of student production in college, there are also other elements, such as jazz hints, which appear in That Smile particularly or in the main music number, which is equal to the collection name, It's Only Life. This recording was made in 2006, after the composition of the actors sang these songs in Lincoln Center in January. There is no libretto or lyrics and even acting there is only less than a half, there is only music and notes. Consequently, it is not a musical at all, because  3 out of 4 compulsory components missing. So, it is just a sequence of songs by artists, who wanted to express own emotions., , 23 best tunes from the 20-year activity of John Bucchino, as a stage's songwriter (an average of 1 per year), gathered here to pay tribute to the man who half of his adult life was working for the theater, proclaiming its popularity among the masses, even if his name does not say anything to someone who did not see anything on Broadway or in general has never been in a theater. His mentor was Sondheim and the last name is loud, unlike Bucchino., , In this cycle of songs, in addition to simple expressions of concern and emotion, the characters through the lyrics and gestures reveal their personal relationships, different views on life, when one is afraid to give too little, and the second â to give too much. There is also a self-examination and discussion aloud in public of their decisions, showing some nudity of souls that performed pretty well in the complete absence of lyrics amongst the songs. It is public entertainment through the prism of gratitude to one person (even if not in the form of âIn the loving memory ofâ¦â), an attempt to use the stage time, giving instead the different characters, sometimes acting on their unlikeness., , This is another production that is and will be quite a popular topic for school and university productions, where it is important to teach students self-expression and emotionally simple things will suit better for this."
"204","Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris ","    Usually, before going to the musical, the audience waits for a performance with a certain plot, which is accompanied by numerous musical scenes. But in this case, everything appeared not as we expected. This musical is one continuous series of songs. But despite this, it doesn't become worse. The producer managed to connect all these, at first sight, different scenes, in one big full show. , , In the musical, a viewer hears different songs of the various moods: from drama to love. But all of them are perfectly combined with each other. Therefore, it doesn't appear an impression that all scenes aren't connected, though at first, it seems impossible. For example, there are scenes from the street holiday, from the military operations and even from the wedding. It sometimes becomes difficult to follow all the changes of the scenery., , And there is a really large amount of ones. It should be noted that the work of the designer of a scene was brilliant. Despite a big variety of locations, it concerned each of them with heavy responsibility. And it was not in vain: such a bright show will be remembered by the viewers for a long time., , The same can be told about the suits. At the musical, there are also masquerade and daily suits, wedding dresses, military uniforms and so on. But each wardrobe item has been worked-out in details., , As for the songs, separate attention should be payed to them. Though they were translated into English, it is possible to hear melodies of the French romance in their execution. And it is a merit of the actors and their remarkable voices again. Music is a highlight of all show. It creates its unforgettable atmosphere., , The main advantage of this show is that it isn't focused on the narrow audience. This musical will give pleasure to everyone, who loves bright representations and just wants to listen to good music. âJacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Parisâ is a kaleidoscope of images and songs and an excellent way to spend your evening."
"205","Jane Eyre ","    This story is a direct incarnation of the world-famous book by Charlotte BrontÃ«, with the same name Jane Eyre â by the name of the main character. You know, she left the house for quite a big distance at that time and ridiculous by today â about 120 kilometers. From the house, where she did not liked into the house, where she never wanted. The author in her book is rich in details, where the sense of horror and sympathy to the girl mixed in each page when it comes to her first days at school. And the main sensation throughout the book, as well as all theatrical narration, was sorry for her unenviable living. In today's world, this woman, of course, we think, would be an outstanding leader, would have inspired a bunch of women to fight for their rights. But in those times she havenât receive proper education, could not understand and realize half of own motivating emotions that made up her desire to move forward. And it ended very sadly, again, according to the modern canons â she was the mother of a child from crippled half-blind old man, actually becoming a mother for two of them., , Charlotte BrontÃ« worked at time, when the term ""feminism"" has not yet been born, and women could not be engaged in any interesting activity, so for her works she took only men's names, for example, Lord Charles Albert. Otherwise, she would not have the opportunity to bring own works to the world. It seems to us that her most famous character is written off from herself, presenting the image of the grown-up Jane girl, and for us seems surreally natural image of her that was captured in a portrait of Charlotte by George Richmond., , Between the book and stage work, it is more in common than difference things. All the main points of the plot are in place: the gothic mood, with the same sullen design of the scene, perverted in their sadism people, who were happily mocked a little insecure girl (Freud cries for their treatment, or a good mental facility), dim glimpses of friendship to soul-mate â a lonely girl from France, which then dies. And, as the biggest event â an affair with her employer, from which she then gives birth. As pointed out by some reputable publications such as The New York Times, the exhibition was carried out in the trailer style, since a large amount of material managed to fit, showing significant milestones, but besides them, everything flashed before eyes. On the other hand, the narrative quality still remains on top, allowing the viewer, even unfamiliar with the book, to become well acquainted with the plot and to immerse into it. Unlike the film adaptation of Atlas Shrugged, where the book was mutilated beyond recognition, where all three parts were disgraceful failure in criticism and in the box office and they even wrote, ""no one amongst the best people worked on this adaptation."", , Incidentally, with regard to film adaptations â there were as many as 25 films in the period between 1910 â 2011 (thus, the centenary even was marked of this novel in the cinema). In the theater and various performances in lots of guises, the spectacle appeared 4 times, not to mention the extensive adaptations â as movies, novels, radio, sequels and spin-offs, making Jane Eyre one of the most popular topics in the world."
"206","Jekyll & Hyde ","    This musical shows a society and a human being from their two sides: good and evil. Sides that are completely different, but closely interrelated and it is impossible to imagine one without the other. Dr. Jekyll shows himself fully, showing a character that can hold two persons: himself and his evil opposite â Hyde. The question arises quite sharply, touching all spheres of human life: family, work, friendship, and strangers. Love line is two-sided. Marital fidelity stands in front of the wrong connection with the prostitute, which is perceived as evil, which ""must be eradicated""., , The actors did their best. The best revealing of the characters did Linda Eder and Robert Cuccioli (Lucy, Jekyll and Hyde, respectively). Linda's voice is fascinating during her parties, plunging the beholders into the atmosphere of the most unrequited love and selfless dream of doctor. The main character, Jekyll, was executed by Robert brilliantly. Their duet was able to show great performanceâ drama woven into the plot, not only by beautiful voices, but also by a great acting, of which even critics admired., , The story itself starts a certain dissonance in a viewer, showing how shaky is the line between light and darkness in the human soul, as one interconnected with each other, leading them apart is very different, but coming out of each other good and evil parts. Jekyll and Hyde is one person, but from totally different angles â a thing that allows to undress every part of the soul and mind of protagonist, making him an antagonist also at the same time, struggling within one person, not between two people, which is quite interesting approach. Shadow and light show so sharply that no one would have any doubt that they cannot co-exist without each other. Here, a good scientist dies, unable to defeat the evil within himself. There are enough things provoking reflections about own life and impulses of living. The production has a decent and fascinating story too, full of professional acting, which makes the colors more vivid and worthwhile."
"207","Jelly's Last Jam ","    This musical is very lively and dynamic, despite its plot. Biography of Morton served nice and colorful, it is obvious that this theatrical will be interesting to fans of classic jazz music and the history of its establishment at a time when the streets were filled with blues. The expressiveness of the protagonist, played by the representative of mixed race â actor and choreographer Gregory Hines, his charisma and the activity on the stage attract the eye, and good jazz music composed for the most part by Morton himself, only completes the picture. All this is based on empathy of the viewer, the ability to plunge into the atmosphere of the early years of and mid of twentieth century, letting the beholder to imbue with the colorful life of the famous musician of those times., , Perhaps his life not really teaches us nothing that could books or movies reveal, but the story itself has value. The ability to give up the pride, stepping through it, and to recognize not only the perfect and unique personality, but also a person, who honors his culture above all. During the year and a half, the history has managed to attract the attention of many spectators, leaving a good impression on this project., , The decision to love or to hate Jelly Roll Morton is adopted by everyone, but his whole life, thoughts of work, and his genius was promulgated in these musical numbers. For fans of his work, it is an ideal opportunity to learn idol much closer as possible. Colossal work of Gregory Hines should be noted, who simply did amazing choreography, for which he was noted repeatedly in the newspapers and in the memory of many viewers, as well as he managed to get several rewards. Many people noted that it was a pity that after the last performances in the 90s, Hines left the scene, having collected several awards, never coming back on it., , Analysts pointed out that this musical was one of the best on Broadway, which used such element as tap dancing that complements the narration. Acts between themselves have very different number of songs. The first â as many as 14, and the second â just 6., , Even in the photographs, it feels jazz and soul compositions. This musical is universal and this is equally possible to show in different eras and costumes according to ones â from simple baggy trousers of ordinary workers to the super-elegant evening dresses of burlesque show. It's fun for fans of the atmosphere of holiday, where the main mood sets tap dance and jazz, where the play of light and shadow mixed with the spontaneity of emotions and erotic images created on stage. Not only by girls in a mouth-watering semi-transparent gowns or nighties, but also imposing men, who look more confident and beautiful than on the poster for the show. Conclusions? Take the ticket and run to arrange one of the best days of your life, where the perfect end of the evening (after a great morning walk and an excellent meal) will be complemented with this musical, filled with passion."
"208","Jennie ","    V. J. Donehue, who worked as the director of this show on Broadway, was not able to organize the work so that the audience liked the musical, despite the very good performance in pre-sales â over USD 1.3 million for a few weeks before the opening. M. Mattox, who choreographed, perhaps performed his work at 80% or so, because none of the critics praised his efforts. In the same way, everyone was silent about the work of costume designer I. Sharaff and talents of stage actors: J. Morris, E. Shutta, G. D. Wallace, I. Fakir, R. Bailey, S. Harris & J. D. Lon., , A. Schulman, author of the libretto, which at the time of writing this, is already 90 years old, did not managed to be remembered by the audience with anything more seriously remarkable, but one quite successful âA Chorus Lineâ in 1985. A. Schwartz, composer, died in 1984 at the age of 83, left marks that are more significant in the life: he has worked with such well-known personalities like Oscar Hammerstein II, Dorothy Fields, and on his account, there are 2 nominations on the Oscar (as he worked not only in theater but also for filming industry). H. Dietz, who died a year earlier than A. Schwartz, at the age of 86 (he was born in 1896), was the author of the libretto. During his life, he spent 15 years in the Vice-Presidentâs chair of the Metro Goldwin Meyer company, having started his career in the 1920s. On Broadway, he had 16 jobs, whose names now will not say anything to theatergoers of nowadays. He was born and died in New York City. Mary Martin left this world in 1990 at the age of 76, leaving behind two children, a star on the Walk of Fame in Hollywood, having featured in more than 50 works on Broadway, movies and on the radio; amongst the most famous works of who was voicing of Peter Pan., , The only thing that was slightly warm marked by critics â the work of the composer, and even then, it was the cause of litigation, when one of the young critics, obviously wanting to make a name for himself, not thoughtfully blamed the composer in ""plagiarism"". How was the case in reality is unclear, but the case was won and production continued. It is likely that this issue raised public interest in the show, allowing serious pre-sale of tickets for the show, which was not managed to show regular exhibitions even over 1 hundred ones., , Among the whole musical, work by Mary Martin was commendable, and if you take away from it all the other components of this musical, and add to them parts made totally in a different style and with great professionalism â the acting and the cast itself, costumes, lights, libretto, scenic decoration â then it would make a strong piece. But it turned out that Mary Martin has been pursued after this by several other failures, her following two musicals were closed during the pre-out-of-town exhibitions, allowing to speak with confidence, decades later, that her name was spoiled with several bad works. As to the nature of the comments of critics, they were sullen and woeful, but sometimes restrained-positive. No one particularly understood, if there was any charm, and if so, of what exactly it consisted?"
"209","Jerry Springer the Opera ","    Once upon a time, when a well-known composer Richard Thomas was sitting in his room, switching TV channels, he came to the show of Jerry Springer. The dregs of society, ready to gnaw through each other's throats, debris of thudding information flowing directly through the screenâs glass thickness, were swallowed by the audience of all categories. This made him horrified, nearly causing a puking reflex. He thought that society is divided into those who are ready to wave with their dirty laundry in front of a crowd for five minutes of despicable fame, and those who are eagerly watching with perverse pleasure the exposure of disgusting details of other people's lives, absorbing and memorizing them., , Darkly pondering all this in front of a screen, on which the unknown people were ready to tear each other's throats like fighting dogs, Richard gave birth to a not bad idea: to show this cons of society in musical. He didnât even have to invent anything, because all the mentioned characters were real but nasty people, exhibited in the broadcast of Jerry Springer. The play was written, the actors were selected, and after the opening, tickets were sold with a bang. Richard Thomas managed to do the unthinkable: to reveal the darkest and repulsive facets of society in the sparkling satire, where every turn was even blacker than black, every phrase was a direct hit in the human vices., , This musical is for gourmets. Being recognized by all British critics, it was sold-out all the time, having incredible success with the most disparate public. Intellectuals were amazed with its depth, embedded in such a simple story, and the ordinary audience, modestly weaker than constant theater-goers, enjoyed a gorgeous black humor. However, after the appearance of the musical on television, many were furious and demanded to close the histrionics, to stop the production and to remove such a shame from the theater scenes. The mentioning of religion in the spectacle of such genre caused a lot of disputes and grievances. Even more riots and protests against the musical were arranged, degrading the feelings of believers. People considered swear words as insulting and humiliating, counted the total number of them in the play, demanding to replace all libretto. Due to complaints, they even had to stop selling DVDs in 2005. All the questions producers answered in that way: everyone bears the risk of not being understood by the masses, trying to show something intriguing and provocative."
"210","Jersey Boys ","    On the stage, the musical appeared in those days, when people just began to remember the greatest hits of the past years, returning to the legends of musical genres decades later. Many songs of this band are not forgotten so far, they are almost a national treasure and, it is clear that they are part of a large and vibrant history. , , Unusual and positive autobiographical piece based on real hits of the group The Four Seasons, extremely popular in the 1960s, this histrionics walked down Broadway hand to hand with success and glory. This is a story that includes a long and hard process of becoming a team not only as a group for a performance of hits, but also a teammates and loyal friends, supporting each other. , , Very lively and colorful music can cheer up even in the gloomiest day and deserves admiration, as in the distant '60s, dipping the beholders into the atmosphere of light and sparkling disco insanity. Mod-actors were performing hot dances on stage and looked similar to idols of millions, not only in appearance and voices, but even in temperament., , It must be said that the work on the musical was extremely difficult, because all the members of the group are still alive. Even the slightest misstep had to be avoided, including minor mistakes in dialogues, to shun sue for misrepresentation. Famous singers were delighted in persons with the done work, though that was hard, because sometimes creators had to rewrite almost completely the whole acts. The classic American success story, where the guys get their way, breaking through with blood and sweat to the heights of show business, to understand that not only fame and money matter in this life."
"211","Jesus Christ Superstar ","    This is one of those productions where the best is to sit in the middle of the hall and not on the first row, because sometimes the events unfold in the viewersâ area, exemplified by the moments in the song âHosannaâ â actors with palm branches start to go out of the hall on the scene. And you, being in the first row, may miss the whole process and only see the final, when the evil Vizier begins to sing in a stupid veil, as if he had stolen a leather ottoman from some soft seating. Wearing sneakers. And being like a parody on Sacha Baron Kohen, although the latter is already a parody of the man. Christ here has the most amazing voice of all, simply divine, but not the best acting talent. However, the emphasis here was unlikely made on a magnificent actor's game. First of all, it is the extremely famous rock opera in the world. It has provocative name, but during watching it, you'll get a pile of rock songs in addition and the emotions of the different characters with free interpretation of the eternal classical story., , This production has been noted by numerous awards and nominations. Above all, Tony in 1972, after the year of origination of the histrionics on Broadway: 5 nominations + 1 victory of Drama Desk and 1 of Treatre World Aw. Secondly, in 1997, London version was marked by Laurence Olivier Aw., and in 2000, its revival on the main theatre area of the world â another Tony nomination. After 12 years, in the second resurrection, a show has gained 2 nominations for Tonies, the same amount of nominations for Drama Desk and 1 win of Theatre World Award., , The first play was made in 1970, by legendary Andrew Lloyd Webber, with a libretto by Tim Rice. Of course, such a high-profile production has become so because several religious groups have cursed it, raising by this the degree of popularity. Most of us can remember the incredibly pretentious flashy odes, bristling with saliva of preachers cursing a show on the sheets of newspapers and on the radio. In some countries it was even forbidden. Jews & some Christians have criticized some of its aspects, in particular, too high human-likeness of Christ and too mild Judas, whereas these moments were ones that creators actually wanted to emphasize. Yes, not all people can be tolerant to the views and opinions of others, hiding behind the dogmas of their faith. Faith is generally very controversial topic for every person who believes in something else besides agnostic and atheistic views. By the way, a wise man said once: ""I have never been offended by Satanists because I did not believe in their Devil, but often was offended by believers because I did not believe in their Godâ. Hence, every sane person who shares the belief that the faith is a philosophical choice of every open-minded person, may conclude that religion is the worst thing that ever happened to humanity, because in the name of religion made the loudest crimes against Humanity and with the name of the Lord on the mouth, the greatest crime committed. Have you ever seen a fanatical atheist who kills you because you do not believe in his Nothing? Or aggressive pastafarians? No? Then think about itâ¦"
"212","Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat ","    Staging is neither new nor has the originality. This story has been told a thousand times in a thousand ways since the birth of Christianity, but it is impossible to say that it has lost its relevance. Human vices have not changed for thousands of years: envy, fear, greed, hypocrisy, selfishness still remain. It is in all of us. But many people, unfortunately, forget that it is always with these qualities come to hand such ones as love, faith, compassion and hope. , , Some may just not know how to live differently. In our time, despite the fact that hunger and locust invasion not threatens anymore with mass extinction to nations, people still too often forget who they are, sticking the animal part of themselves inside out. , , The original way of exhibition pleases the eye. The story that was told earlier as the teaching by elderly people, is presented now in a new light, fits the music right and told with well choreography and brilliant directing by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice. They were inspired by this story and decided to put it on stage after their Jesus Christ â Superstar became a huge hit. So they took a chance. Not to say that the spectacular was at least a third part the same successful as the previously mentioned one, but just as many times have been viewed by the public for a year and a half of its time on Broadway. , , Remarkable is the variety of musical styles in a play. French ballads, disco, rock and roll, jazz and others. They flow among each other perfectly. Each style meets certain costumes, changing on the actors, which only added to the flavor and vivacity of the show."
"213","Jungle Book ","    This colorful and amazing cartoon appeared under the supervision of Walt Disney and quickly snatched a piece of success. Kipling and his stories were no less popular than now. Exotic tales of countries, far from the northern people living in concrete boxes of cities. Worlds, embellished by thousands of colors, lively and sometimes lurid for urban residents, stories with no less bright characters. The musical caused a sensation, gathering a lot of opinions and drawing attention to the work of the already famous writer even more. , , Like any work of Disney, The Jungle Book is remembered with its unobtrusive positivity, being a child fairy tale, which is pleasant to both adults and children, being clear even for the youngest audience, but not losing its relevance for the older generation. The cartoon is still more for family viewing. Music for it was written very appropriate, and reflects the characters and the atmosphere of life away from people under the wild rhythm of the jungle, which set totally different rules of the game. Sometimes very dangerous ones. Analyzing its pros and cons is a bad job, as it narrates, teaches and alarms â everyone will find here what they want to see. After several decades pass, cartoon was written in gold classics fund of Disney animation., , Perhaps it is worth noting that such a joyful and vivid picture did not fit the description of the word ""jungle"" and devoid of that gloomy sadness described by Kipling in his works, where everything was not so colorful and nobody was having fun around the clock. The events were much more severe and close to real life, but Walt Disney decided other, rejecting more realistic scenario by one of his colleagues, Bill Pitt. In any case, the musical was designed for children as the main audience. And remember that this was Walt Disney, after all. This studio does not do gloomy pictures much. Well-designed images, decent music and very colorful cartoon please the eye. If you do not make references to Kipling's product and do not focus on the deeper meaning, which authors abandoned in the picture, you can simply enjoy a pleasant story and sketches of skilled artists, who have created this flamboyancy on the screen. Tale that teaches that no matter how small you are and how different you are from others, the main thing is real friends and a brave heart to overcome all the obstacles."
"214","Just So ","    Strange costumes, bright personalities, unusual hats and plot. Crocodile is like two halves of a green suitcase covered with party paper. Freestyle and frivolous style of dress, no hesitation to get on the clothes, which not decorate, but does make actors look like clowns or parodies â the lot of low-grade humor, like Nigerian. Following the title, in this musical things happen not through the invincible story, it does not follow the cause-and-effect relationship, or logical sequence, but simply because they can occur in some parallel universe of the theater. Theatre as always, do not particularly recognize the laws of logic and humans, there are some things like ex machina, that can be not masked and hidden anymore, hot holding 8 trump aces in the sleeve. This theatrical has the courage to admit directly that promotes harlequinade. Tomfoolery. Stage pandemonium. Any term that describes the unreal twists and turns of moves in this play, worthy of life, if this histrionics lives next to us., , Of course, because of so easy and simple format of presenting information, the play has become very audacious, especially for children who were happy to visit the production. Costumes that for adults may seem strange and not combined, in the children's world at once acquire the outlines of cute little animals and all clearly understand, where is the crocodile, and where, for example, the crab or an elephant. The Daily Telegraph fully agreed with these characteristics of this musical., , Version of 2002 came already elaborated otherwise than original, it is in fact different from all previous versions. A version of the 2004 supported 2002nd one, bringing visually indistinguishable differences. In 2004 was the same team, the same creator and the same director. The original authors of the idea â A. Drewe & G. Stiles (known to us from other loud creatures as Mary Poppins & Honk!), in subsequent stagings have not been actively involved (apparently sold their rights on it). Thanks to them, it turned as an interesting fusion of fantasy, play, singing and vivid costumes, where equally stupid and contrast may look both adult actors and children, if the children's formats of this play will ever be delivered., , At the time of writing, the project is aged 32 years, and the last time it stepped on the stage when celebrated 25th anniversary â a quarter of a century! Eclectic and narrative story, which literally throws us into a parallel reality â all this was worthy to entertain the motliest audience for such a long time!"
"215","King and I","    The musical was very relevant in those days, when it appeared on stage. So much so that there were a few adaptations, and the libretto became the basis for motion picture. The play became more popular because of the filmâs arrival. The plot may seem to be something absurd, judging from the todayâs points of view. But remember that 2 hundred years ago, there were few educated people and they were appreciated much. Musical depicts historical events, the cultural heritage of Siam very much (so much that the screening of the film was forbidden in Thailand at all), and the plot is so simple and commonplace that one can only wonder to such a stunning success. , , Production, in spite of everything, has been made quality. Good choreography, worked-out music numbers and plot ligaments, shifts that do not catch gaze. In those years on Broadway there were dozens of these pieces. It was the golden era of classic plays, and they all went fantastically successful. Critics and ordinary people were flattering about this production. It is impossible not to note the quality of the costumes, hand-picked very thoroughly and meticulously, as from one look at the actors you cease to even think that they were actually not born in Bangkok, plunging into the atmosphere of Oriental life. However, it is worth considering, would this staging had such a success, whether the producer was a true Thai person, because at that times, frankly, the dreams of American and European women hardly have been associated with Asian men, with a few exceptions. , , For the general public it was really successful staging. It is light; the story does not concern the global and heavy issues, although it is interesting to watch the way people changed between ""then"" and ""now"", noting a striking difference in national identities and social issues, looking at levels of contact between people from different countries. Humor, thin and actual, is perceived easy and pleasant, and the voice of actors are very powerful and suitable for characters, unlike the on-screen version of the musical. It does not allow distractions, immerses a beholder in an unobtrusive plot. Even if all the historical figures, mentioned in this setting, were depicted not truly, who cares if this entertains us?"
"216","Kinky Boots ","    Comedy, as it stated, was based on real events. It is difficult to imagine that the life of an ordinary, unremarkable human being meets such dramatic changes, and that all that surrounds him, is screaming to accept these changes. Probably the things that were happening before our eyes were much shortened version of all adversities, stood on the way of the young clerk named Charlie Price, a completely insecure guy. Or maybe, vice versa, many obstacles and harsh things were added in order to make it look less ordinary., , It is worth noting that the musical orientation definitely was not designed for narrow-minded and intolerant public, as the issue of acceptance of what is difficult to understand to the average person, is very serious here. The picture put many social problems on the very thin edge: the problem of social not-acceptance ""of those who are not like we are"", including the absolute rejection of radical changes not only in yourself and outlook on life, but also in the people around you. , , The world is moving, the world runs, the world is changing and never stands still. This is one of the main ideas of this production, which shows all the conservative people in the factory, suddenly confronted in their coordinated work with something unknown and unfamiliar, namely exotic footwear forâ¦ transvestites. Humor and the ease with which a character Lola withstands hits from people, seems so natural that we unwittingly imbued with sympathy to her. Lola is a bright woman and a performer on the stage and a well-groomed and handsome man. Two beginnings, opening one person from diametrically opposite sides, shall make think even the most dry and stale person that there are various lives of different people. Contrast histrionics includes boring Charlie, who becoming a strong leader involuntarily, town residents, ossified in their views, many-faceted Lola, and even a thin and beautiful storyline. It takes a lot of attention to this spectacular., , Without a doubt, you can call this musical one of the best solutions for the Broadway production. Aside the difficult ambiguity on the scene, it has turned lively freak show, which occasionally occurs in the scene. But for sure here we find humor, irony, and the ease. They all earned positive feedback, recognition of the public, and collected awards. "
"217","Kismet ","    The tale that came to us from the East, inspired by the famous ""Thousand and one nights"", does not connect the audience with dreary and difficult plot. Simple and cautionary tale ridiculing human foibles and vices, which allows to believe that Madame Fate is sometimes incredibly strong, and good always triumphs over evil. Even if the good is not very good and evil is not entirely evil. All here is like the wise people of the East love. There is no historical value inside. It does not reveal the life of East to people of distant countries who are not familiar with the story, but nevertheless, the atmosphere of the bustling everyday life in Baghdad is actually felt. Maybe the ideas about the Eastâs life for many generations are too clearly settled in the minds of hundreds of people, but no one can deny the excellent work of costume designers, who have created the real Baghdad on stage., , You cannot clearly attribute the work to the classical oriental tales, rather just to the stories that you can tell to a naughty child or obedient adult. The very focus of the story is on bright and vivid spectacular, noisy, full of variety and significant outfits in numbers, not devoid of the beauty of Oriental dances, performed by beautiful girls. Characters has lack of psychological depth, and the plot does not make to reflect much about what people wanted to show or to reveal. Itâs all easy and simply understood. Humor, some lightheadedness and simplicity bribe the beholders. Maybe only the recklessness is not the same fluffy as it was at the beginning, maybe actors were tired of so many productions. , , In the newer versions of it, it was decided to change the nature of the Hajj on more reckless and simple in comparison to the original version of the musical of 1911, which only won the viewer's hearts. "
"218","Kiss Me, Kate ","    It is quite interesting musical for those who love ""the story in the story"" style, Shakespeare's plays and love comedies. There is also a television version of the musical, which is recommended to viewing too. But watching the show on a stage is the best way to feel its atmosphere and to enjoy the music., , The plot of the musical is quite simple. What is really interesting, it is partly based on the real events. Fred, the actor, divorced with his wife Lily a year ago. His friend, composer Cole Porter, brought him the scenario of the new musical. Fred and Cole know that only Lilly can play Katerina's role professionally. Therefore, they invite her to play in the musical. Keen on joint game on a scene, Fred and Lily understand that they still love each other. But he already has a girlfriend Lois, and she has a groom who is engaged in cultivation of cattle in Texas., , After a performance, a pleasant aftertaste remains. This is beautiful spectacular: scenery, lighting, dances, and suit. All this things are at the top-level. Voices of actors are lively and pure â it is very pleasant to listen to them. However, the terrifying falseness in drama (not musical and dancing) episodes spoils almost all pleasure. The conductor and an orchestra gave all their best. Music bewitches and excites., , As it was spoken earlier, the plot is a history of incomplete love of the former spouses, who met on a stage in joint performance. It's an unusual form of the show. The performance is a story in story, with all experiences and emotions, postponed on the audience. It is like Master and Marguerite by Bulgakov in the style, but at much lower level., , The musical will also be pleasant to great William Shakespeare's admirers and his play âThe Taming of the Shrewâ. Besides that, there is a set of sending to this work in the performance, the show is the modern version of the play. There is also one more disadvantage of this musical. When the viewer watches it for the first time, he cannot understand it. Some scenes, such as communication of the ex-husband and wife, beginning with mops and unflattering words about the audience, can seem boring or just not be pleasant to them. Thus, an audience should be prepared to watch this musical upfront it enters the hall. , , It is better to see a premier of the performance not when it is shown for the first or the second time. Watch it after the sixth â when roles are already strummed, actors have achieved good teamwork and begin to improvise. It is difficult to understand the musical from the first attempt. But if the viewer watches it 2-3 times, it is difficult to promise that show won't be pleasant. The musical may not be suitable for family viewing. But the audience of 16 years can come to the performance and enjoy it. In general, ""Kiss me, Kate"" is an interesting embodiment of the Shakespeare's play with elements of modern comedy."
"219","Kiss Of The Spider Woman ","    Unfortunately, in the modern world, a person often should face cruelty and injustice that hardens character and sets more gloomy colors in the life. In such moments, there is a wish to be fenced off from surrounding environment and to create your own world. Production of musicals paid not so frequent attention to such subjects. Therefore, it is seldom possible to see the shows, which can transfer relevance of the question. However, creators of this drama managed to carry out this task. Two strangers are forced to share one chamber in the South American prison. One of them, the homosexual, sits for improper abuse of the under-age teenager. The second one, the journalist, has been imprisoned for his belonging to extremely left movements in the country. It seems that these two people will never be able to find a common language. But the general space and long joint pastime inevitably force heroes to make strong friendly relations., , The most important advantage of the musical is an acting, which has embodied something tremendous on the stage. Of course, the greatest impression was made by game of the actor who played a role of the homosexual Molina. He managed to exhibit the man who hated cruelty and injustice of the world around and created his own world, in which he is a beautiful woman loved by all men. Of course, it is impossible to forget the actor who played the journalist, who recovers from anger thanks to Molina's attention. At last, the considerable share is occupied by the woman who has played at once three roles, each of which was exceptional part of the performance., , The director has connected several genres at once. Here the viewer will see both the distinguished psychological drama, and the extremely topical political thriller, and just something unusual. The main characters have embodied two types of the person in a crisis situation. The director intentionally opposed them to each other to prove that they are similar and will be able to survive only through common efforts. As for the scenario, there is a wish to read a novel of the same name already during watching. Going into details of the plot, it should be noted that it consists of three main layers. The first, main one, happens in the 80th in one of the South American prisons, which always was different with especially cruel attitude towards all prisoners. The second layer is memories of Molina. The third layer is a mysterious history of spider woman, who has to be fenced off from the world around because of her singularity. All these layers are crossed and let the viewer know several concluded meanings of the musical at once."
"220","Kitty's Kisses ","    Simple, without any psychological burden and special meaning, this musical, as well as many others like it, experienced the great success on Broadway at those times. It did not press, not blamed society, was not making fun of people. No, it has been done with pleasure and for pleasure. Smooth and enchanting musical motives kindly and gently set the desired mood and a light veil of love, youth, and lightness. Honey voices of young female performers are in contrast to bass voices of their colleagues sound very appropriate, and all tracks are unobtrusively tell us the flirting story. Perhaps that is why it was decided to make a record later, after almost a hundred years, leaving this long-forgotten musical at least as a track-list., , CD, of course, will be wanted by everyone who is even slightly acquainted with the stars of those times. R. Luker (Kitty), P. Chaffin (Robert), V. Clark (Mrs. Dennison) & D. Burstein (Mr. Dennison) in the lead roles! This edition is simply obliged to be on the shelves of collectors and connoisseurs of the early twentieth century. Broadway classics, after all. Sam Davis finely coped with the creation of a living atmosphere in the recording. Orchestra management is given to him as if nothing hard, while melodies sound like a noble chamber ensemble performing ballads. "
"221","La Cage Aux Folles ","    The secret of success is very simple. The audience, of course, wants to lift the curtain a little bit and to see how the people, different from them, live. For this reason, the scene, where the distinction between moral & immoral was almost erased, had a runaway success. But it's not only that. Musical is funny, witty & very clever, done with fine humor. , , Georges is obsessed with copulation, but he is very nice, kind & clever, a tongue does not turn to call him immoral. At the same time, father of the bride with his moralizing chatter looks like a soulless orthodox. In the play, there is a clash of two diametrically opposed worlds: the extreme Puritanism and the equally extreme tolerance for violations of accepted moral standards of ordinary gray people. Common points of contact of these poles are: they probably would never have crossed if not for the upcoming wedding of children. Jean-Michel himself and his charming bride on the background of the two papas look more than modest and traditional. However, there is no conflict between fathers and children in this exhibition. , , Of course, it is quite understandable why the musical is named this way: when all the cranks are collected under the same roof and the cell is closed, the only way to save own reputation is to get rid of the burdensome stereotypes. As the heroes succeed, then career of the official person and the happy family life of two elderly gays were saved. At some point of time, they were standing on the same side, where they were hiding from the press. It may be considered as some united position of all â nobody likes the press., , Featured in the show love of two men is not the stereotypical relationship between ""birdies"". This is a true sample of loyalty, devotion, tenderness and incredibly perceptible sadness. In addition, this musical is very French. Only the French people could develop such a story without any hint of coarseness and vulgarity. As for the funny scenes â they are plenty. An official dude dresses in the wackiest gowns, fleeing from reporters! And what about Albin with his tantrums and touchiness? Simply charming! Georges feels somewhat uncomfortable in the role of a respectable bourgeois, but he feels wanting to do everything for the happiness of his son., , Of course, manners of transvestites are much more exaggerated and simulated than in the normal life. But the main thing is that the musical is intelligent, kind, without the slightest hint of dirt or vulgarity, which in contemporary art happens sometimes. With regard to the essence, its quality is no doubt valuable. J. Herman wrote wonderful music and H. Fierstein â an impeccable libretto. "
"222","Last 5 Years","    Unusual musicalâs structure has provided a lot of space for the quality artistic execution. It is worth noting that N. L. Butz & S. R. Scott fully taken advantage of their chances and played almost the best roles in their careers. In fact, throughout the play, we see only two characters â male and female. In this situation, particular attention is directed toward artists. Butz perfectly played the role of Jamie. Through his character, he demonstrated to spectators bright emotions such as joy, love, confidence in the future and so forth. Unlike his theatrical partner, S. Scott played more dramatic character. Sorrow, tears, hysteria & depression were the main satellites of heroine. Acting is the strongest part of this piece. , , The director did not try to simplify his work. He uses sophisticated dialogues, innovative twists, making the viewer think. All the scenes have rather interesting music accompaniment. It has everything â classical piano, rock sounding. Such diverse music decorates the production, as well as successfully emphasizes already excellent artistic execution., , This is a visual aid for young couples demonstrating the complexities of family life. Many lovers initially think that their relationship will last forever. But the gray everydayâs life gradually makes romance fade, passion disappears somewhere. For example, the main audience can see what mistakes led to the emergence of a precipice between people, leading to a further separation. After analyzing of this creature of J. R. Brown, you can take home many useful thoughts. Perhaps one of them will help you to build really strong and lasting relationships."
"223","Leader of the Pack ","    Leader of the Pack is a collection of songs of jukeboxâs type. The main feature of these compositions is that they are all created by the same composer â E. Greenwich. Every song reflects a certain stage in her life. Vivid narration begins from the middle of the twentieth century. Dreamy girl write songs that has been performed on the radioâ¦ It could not become a reality if Ellie had not taken active steps to achieve it. , , Through perseverance of talented author, the world was able to hear the unique melodies imbued with ease and cheerfulness. Despite the troubles in personal life, Ellie was able to create many masterpieces that became famous. The popular music of those years cannot be imagined without her compositions. Almost every song, executed in the musical, has enthusiasm of 60s. She embodied pursuit of happiness and personal self-expression in own works. Even in the lyrical songs, we hear the lust of her life. , , Scenic images of characters fully reproduce the world of the 60's. Thanks to the wonderful costumes of artists, the beholder can become a part of that glorious time. Stage design underlines the atmosphere and helps the viewer to immerse in the fashion. Music of this period still sounds lively and interesting. Choreography staged very professionally., , Large orchestra was involved in the musical. All songs sound at a high level. Voices of artists fully convey the emotions of characters. In the case of Ellie, it is not surprising â the woman remembers those moments in life, during which these works were written. The pop-rock of '60s sounds at a very decent level. Hits of the time have become classics. After seeing this production, no viewer will remain indifferent. Youth reminds to those people who have already forgotten about it that life never stops. Never grow old in soul â the first rule of the sixties. That based the main meaning of the music here., , Thanks to Ellie, the beholder can again enjoy the wonderful songs from the past. Some people will hear them for the first time, while others can recall the years of childhood and adolescence. Travel back in time is possible without a time machine thanks to works like this."
"224","Legally Blonde ","    Legally Blonde is the unique story of human reincarnation. In bright colors, it demonstrates what can be achieved by putting a goal and making great efforts for its implementation. In reflection of Elle Woods, everyone can see the part of himself or herself. The project is full of instructive moments and promises. Your main task is not to forget them, but to make correct conclusions and follow a dream., , Spectator of New York Times B. Brantley called Legally Blonde kind and fun action, to which energetic narrative style was inherent. He also noted that the musical has all chances to become the spiritual inspiration for many women, who dream to achieve certain heights in life., , Behind all the comfort and ease, Legally Blonde hides enormous sense. Musical teaches not only how to set a goal and to achieve it, but not to give up. The only obstacle standing in the way of recognition of this production totally motivating is the presence of a certain percentage of naivety. Elle Woods was conceived as a comic character. This is evidenced by her clothes, manner of communication, and behavior in general. Unprepared viewer may feel sometimes uncomfortable to grasp the messages of the musical, when in front of him on the stage is dressed in bright pink blonde telling something about the laws in her funny manner. But from the opposite side, it is wonderful and stimulating comedy., , This project is not exciting in terms of vocal accompaniment. Most of the songs are comedic in nature, and therefore, executed without high energy. Someone may feel not enough the rate of speed, the charisma of the actors, and their singing voices. Song Omigod You Guys represents Legally Blonde fully. It exactly fits all the above characteristics. , , There are many reasons to consider this creature as a theater of one artist. In our situation â of one actress. In the Broadway production, the role of first violin played by L. B. Bundy, in London â S. Smit. Who of the girls could better embody the character of Elle Woods on stage? This question is quite difficult to answer because both singers were able to fit the image perfectly. S. Smit better revealed the dramatic side of the Elle. The actress managed to convey qualitative experiences of her character, her fears and concerns. As for L. B. Bundy, she was more like a classic cheerful Miss Woods, which we know from book and film. , , Speaking about modern comedy musicals, many experts in the first place remember about Legally Blonde. Why? It's fun to watch. In addition to its primary mission to entertain the audience, it also demonstrates the tenacity with which everyone should fight for own dream. It is pity that every year fewer and fewer musicals illuminate the above-mentioned issues."
"225","Lennon ","    Despite the ambiguous attitude of the journalists, the musical has been a boon to fans of the great musician. This also was a wonderful chance to see a great play of actors, which were given out on the stage entirely, and, of course, to hear the familiar (and not very) songs of the former participant of The Beatles. The greatest attention is given to the works of Lennon after he broke with the Beatles, as well as to his relationship with his wife. , , Play gives the space for nine people of different ages and ethnicity: Will Chase, Chuck Cooper, Julie Danao Salkin, Julia Murney and others. Multinational composition of the troupe is very symbolic: it says about Lennonâs creativity significance for people throughout the world, regardless of nationality or race. The attitude of the actors to the roles entrusted to them is an indicator of aspiration to perform a great job. J. D. Salkin, American actress of Filipino origin, said that her role as Yoko Ono was a great honor for her. Underlining the major role of Yoko in the creation of this play, J. Danao said that this strong, courageous, and very beautiful woman supported them all. , , The main idea was expressed by the author of the play Don Scardino. We have attempted to analyze the impact of Lennonâs art on the surrounding reality and how reality itself has influenced him â he said. Remarkable is review of Canadian musicians P. Allen & W. Shaffer. They think it was great. The play showed how classy the contribution of Lennon was not only to pop music, but also to the culture as a whole. If you hear his songs for the first time â you like them. But the more you listen to them, the more you understand their true meaning., , Here are the views of other spectators. One fellow said that the performance wasnât great, but it will survive. Not being a fan of John Lennon, other told that it was a really good show, truthfully drawing the life of musician. Despite the ambiguity of the play, a musical is worth seeing, to honor the memory of Mr. Lennon, and listen to his creations., , The performance was subjected to repeated criticism of journalists. According to ones from New York Times, the lack of performance is its Ono-centricity, because it focuses on the period of life of Lennon with Yoko. Daily News newspaper had spoken even more emphatically. They noted that events in the play were as if filtered through Onoâs vision and only those people and events were reflected that she wanted to reveal there. According to them, the performance slightly shows an early period of his work, the first marriage, work with the Beatles. Reporters suggested opinion that they wanted to see a more complete disclosure of the great musicianâs periods of living. , , Despite the criticism, Lennonâs admirers took the play literally with a bang. In response to the attacks, Don Scardino, the author of the play, said that starting from a certain period, it is impossible to imagine life or work of the former The Beatles member separately from Yoko Ono. According to her, the musical had ridiculous and funny episodes, but Lennonâs murder scene brought tears to the eyes of most beholders. Each of the fans of the great Lennon as if lived his life, along with the actors of the play. , , The musical has taken a worthy place among the performances on Broadway, which tell about famous artists (ABBA, legends of American rock Beach Boys and others)."
"226","Les Miserables ","    Material of the book, on which the musical is based, has madly volume: there are a lot of events and casual characters about whom the author tries to tell as much as possible. It is very difficult to allocate the most important things, not to cut out necessary and to capture the scale, and of course, to set everything to music. The directors carried out tremendous work!, , The viewer learns all necessary ideas, shortly meets with all heroes. But he isn't taken away far. Creators bring them to the main thing. It is a story about love. Someone loves God. Or is it love between the young man and the girl, pure and gentle? , , Someone loves money. He is vain, ambitious and strives for greatness. Someone is loyal to great ideals. This is a story about love, kindness and mercy. And it's also about that light at the end of the tunnel that has to condescend on everyone who lives a righteous life. The musical is also about fight and about revolution., , Actor's job should be noted. The game of the woman, who plays Kozetta, deserves special attention. She faultlessly played her small role full of suffering and pain. A certain grandiosity and affectedness of innkeepers can a bit confuse the viewer. After all, this is the musical, so the directors were able to afford some juicy highlight. Paris and barricades were shown perfectly. This is the tremendous raise of the people. There are heaps of furniture, tools, people and flags. It is the uniform organism, united by a fine rush. As it is nice that the viewer knows â everything has ended well., , Separate thank to costumers! Distinguished dresses of Kozetta, poor clothes of Eponine and madam Tenardye's magnificent gown. Even men's suits are stylish and original. Make-up artists have also tried wonderfully well. Overall, this is fantastic show, which won't leave any viewer indifferent., , In the late nineties, the musical was planned to be created in Russia. G. Vasilyev & A. Ivashchenko were authors of idea. For implementation of the plan, the production company was created and the rights were bought from authors of original histrionics. Nevertheless, crisis of 1998 prevent creating of the project. Authors began to write libretto to their own musical."
"227","Lestat ","    Lestat asked Marius, what is the meaning of vampire life. One of the earliest members of the genus replied that he didnât know. In these lines lie the two main meanings of musical named Lestat. The first demonstrates that even after obtaining immortality, people often do not find their place in the world and dissolve. The second shows that even a vampire has the right to choose his or her path: one becomes a ruthless machine of death, while others refrain from violence and trying to enter into eternity like an ordinary person. It depends solely on each vampire, particularly, from power of will and the ability to hide the dark side. , , During the musical, Lestat was able to experience all the above-mentioned delights of vampire life. Saying in the final âI am the Vampire Lestat, and I will live foreverâ, he makes it clear that he was able to find the meaning of the further existence. What it is? This is an entirely different question. , , It is possible that in this musical, Hugh Panaro had to perform the most difficult role in his artistic career. Lestat is dramatic character, whose identity constantly transforms with the knowledge of vampire nature. In some episodes, he appears as a weak personality, ready to die at this very moment, and in the other â as the absolutely ruthless villain, instilling a sense of fear in the viewer. Actor, without exaggeration, played excellent and very sorry that for his work he wasnât awarded nor even nominated on any prestigious award., , Music is another strong point of the production. It rarely comes to the fore, but it creates a quality background, harmoniously blends with action. Solo song Lestat In Paris is tremendous! Tenor of actor Hugh Panaro will remain in the memory of the audience. But this musical may have not been made, if Elton John didnât insist on the creation., , Lestat is unique kind of musical. It must be said that the project is really complex. It raises problems of human relationships and emotions, only reveals them in rather exotic form. Gothic style of narration, beautiful voices & artistic performance, fantastic attires â all of this gives cult status to the play, which we have already felt in the movie."
"228","Li'l Abner ","    Li'l Abner is a musical show practically with no weaknesses. Critics liked to point out that the atmosphere of the original comics is felt weakly in it. Maybe. But how can this relatively small negative item erase fine acting, beautiful performance and harmoniously fitting of the show in the fun criteria, transforming the scene onto the fairy tale of our days? Its choreography, according to many estimates, was recognized as the best in the history of hosting theater. , , There are suspicions that writers Norman Panama and Melvin Frank deliberately simplified the creation of Alfred Caplin, making it softer and easier to understand. This has its own logic â people donât like too complicated things. It's one thing if the USâs political elite was an object of derision or criticism of the gender policy by goofy characters. This is always perceived with humor and a certain indulgence. And totally another thing, when all these are performed on Broadwayâs scene. Many spectators were annoyed by such a sharp position and this could adversely affect the ultimate success of the musical. But there were some ignorance of the ideas of original comics, and in addition, they were even softened. The authors dressed it into satirical attire and director fitted it onto frameworks of censorship. , , Returning to the artists, it is worth noting the excellent Eddie Adamsâ acting. For elegant incarnation of the character Daisy Mae, actress was awarded with Tony. Largely Li'l Abner brought her world fame. Adams has introduced a concept of sexuality on stage in a theater. In this, she was a pioneer, along with the famous Broadway and Hollywood stars like Marilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn and others. , , Pleasant melodies of Michael Kidd reveal miracles of choreography â the two most vibrant parts of the musical. It's A Typical Day, Jubilation T. Cornpone and other compositions sit long in the memory of the audience. In conjunction with a fine and smart game of actors, they give an unforgettable effect."
"229","Light in the Piazza ","    Good old neo-romanticism comes back on Broadway. Musicalâs success is easily explained by the fact that the audience missed the tragic stories of unrequited love. The creators deliberately refused pathos and shine on the stage, which was typical for the projects like Mamma Mia!, Jersey Boys and others. According to one of the actors, director of production set the emphasis on creation of a touching performance that can interest viewer of any kind. , , Clear structure, bright main characters â the elements, which are missing to connoisseurs of the genre. Very rarely the viewer feels sympathy almost to all the characters of the play. Clara embodies innocence, Fabrizio â passion and an irresistible thirst for love. Even Margaret, which often becomes an obstacle in the relationship of the main characters, does this not out of malice, but because of maternal care. Other subtle characters also cause positive emotions. The exception is, perhaps, Roy Johnson, who has little interest in the fate of his sick daughter. , , Musical accompaniment is considered the main attraction of this production. Chic voices and approaching to opera singing leave a strong impression. The composer applied a rather interesting solution, not limited with exclusively English songs. In a musical, a number of songs were in Italian. The latter not only sound beautifully, but also help to create the atmosphere of real Florence. Particularly impressive song is Il Mondo Era Vuoto. In it, a young Italian shares the fear of losing his beloved Clara forever. The Light In The Piazza is a unique creation, reiterating to the classic roots of the genre. This is a true and rather dramatic story, describing wonderful feeling."
"230","Likes of US","    This show tells the story of a great person. He has demonstrated to the world that it is possible to achieve the results, if not to deviate from the intended target. Besides, you have to obtain a huge heart, to do such tremendous and heart-touching things like organization of a childâs house, a shelter for many thousands younglings, to be available to take them away from the streets, to give warmth and some education., , The main task of producers was to demonstrate the process of formation of Thomas John Barnardo, as well as to emphasize the particularly dramatic and outstanding moments of his life and work. They coped fully with their mission. The story looks complete and causes great interest of viewers. At the beginning of the musical, many characters treat Barnardo with caution, seeing too idealistic person in him. But in the final stages, absolutely everyone empathizes with the main character. There is a considerable merit of an actor, played the role of a philanthropist. He was able to feel and to reveal his character thoroughly and fill it with the image of the desired emotions. Other actors coped also very good, particularly, ones performing children. Although they had parts of the second range., , The music accompaniment is an essential element of this play. Lyrical compositions dominate. They contain a certain touch of tragedy. Although it was not without a few cheerful songs. Love Is Here by James Moore (Johnny) and Amy Price (Jenny) sounds heart-felt and touching. Within a few minutes, this item charges the audience with positive emotions and gives hope for a happy ending of the story., , The main message of this production â never shut yourself off the problems of other people. Even in the absence of opportunity, you should always try to help this or that person, if you aspire. If you can do nice things â please, do them. The world is so nasty place that even a little help stays with us for many years. This is the only way you can make this world a better place. Of course, not all will be able to give hope for the future of thousands of human beings, but you may try to do your best in what you can. , , T. J. Barnardo was a unique person, managed to get a really great success. But in the case of other people, even the smallest assistance is a victory, and very serious, especially if this person is about to die from hunger or from cold, sleeping on the bare ground. It would mean that the seeing of the musical is not in vain, and beholders still managed to draw the right conclusions."
"231","Lion King ","    This musical should appeal to adults and children, who remember well (and love) the nicest heroes of their childhood â Simba, Mufasa, Pumbaa, and the rest of the good and instructive characters who belong to different biological species. Broadway productions are rarely turned bad, because they often try on other scenes, before they put on the major stages of the world. And even more so, those who have survived already for more than 6,000 performances in total, around the world, â definitely will not be poor. This musical is almost a legend, like Cirque du Soleil in own field, which has a huge team of people of over a 1000 ones and travel with many splendid tours around the globe., , If to do a little research, then we receive the following data: from about of 7,000 people who have already visited this presentation and left their feedback, 6,500 people (almost 93%) were happy and very happy about it. Another 5% â those who did not find in it anything supernatural, but generally, have been pleased with what they saw. And only a small fraction (2%) said that the show is more likely bad than good one. Of course, everyone has an opinion, and someone may not like movies from the Disney studio (or shows by them). 100% of people will never be pleased. But if 95 people out of 100 are satisfied, then the creators, for example, the director Julie Taymor, do a very right thing., , Production, which received more than one Tony Award, as well as dozens of other awards (not to mention all the nominations), is a costume show, with the use of ethnic instruments, voices, sounds and dialects of distant Africa. Music pleases the most. By the way, they were on tour in Africa, so among the people who came to the performances, some of them must be those who were able to enjoy the sounds of their native languages and managed to understand everything that was sung in the songs., , Everyone admires the complexity of the costumes, which were designed for this show. And the way they are combined with people-actors. There is an interesting way, indeed. Since the animals are tried to be displayed in a full size, for the giraffes, for example, they built a suit, in which a person can walk only using four long poles, wearing long construction depicting the neck. For elephants the most difficult part was the trunk, because a human-actor experience physical scarcity of limbs to manage it, as they must have had 5 of them, not four. Basically, the acting is a combination of the use of colorful and informative suits with facial expressions and body movements of participants. Thus, it has turned out as if you look at the animal hero and at the same time â at the person who, due to this duality, allows himself to give more to the audience than it might have be in the simpler form for a man, dressed in some kind of a normal, human-looking, costume. This unusual approach creates additional richness of show, which is complemented by the phenomenally ethnic music."
"232","Little Fish ","    âLittle Fishâ musical was created by American author of lyrics, music and libretto of Italian origin Michael John LaChiusa. The master is famous for works Hello, Again, Mary Christine and See What I Wanna See, Mr. LaChiusa, was nominated four times for Tony Awards and once received the prize for his libretto., , The play was made by the author on the ground of two interesting and deeply moral stories of Deborah Eisenberg, whose works have regularly appeared in The New Yorker. In 2003, it was firstly directed by Graciela Daniele and consisted of only one 90-minutes-act. She had ideas and understanding of a work in common with the author himself. That is why the play gained sharp-edged contours and accurate-performed feelings. The cast of the play was very small: 8 actors and 7 musicians. The brilliant scenes reflecting the rhythm of the contemporary city were made by Henandez. It`s also important to mention talented lightning designer Eisenhauer, whose work made an invaluable contribution in the outstanding musical., , The premiere was held at Off-Broadway theater and, according to a number of editions` reviews, failed into a funk. As Mr. LaChiusa lately said, NY didn`t want to understand hard, serious and challenging material as fun and cheerful musical. A lot of critics noticed that Little Fish is an actual answer on the Mr. Sondheimâs Company. Even the leading character, Charlotte is similar to Sondheim`s Bobby, who is also a thoughtful, disjoint soul with inner struggle and monotonous life full of emptiness., , The musical Little Fish is a faultless, well-considered and deeply moral work, which shows the real crisis, fears, feelings and final metamorphose of a person. Jennifer Laura Thompson perfectly performed Charlotte, a 30-years-old NY writer, who suffered from smoking obsession, her inner weakness and strict behavior of her creepy boyfriend. She runs away from real problems and tries to abstract herself from her lifeless being. The main idea of the play is that life can be enjoyed only together with the society or in big âschools of fishâ. The play teaches everyone to enjoy yourself, to be self-esteemed and strong, to live an interesting, colorful life with people who really love you, to appreciate friendship and togetherness., , Also it`s necessary to point out the terrific play of Hugh Panaro (ex-boyfriend of Charlotte), amusing gay Marco was performed by Jesse Tyler Ferguson. Actors of double roles Ceilia Keenan Bolger and Ken Marks were harmonic with characters whey played., , After the premiere, there were a lot of comments on âLittle Fishâ in such great editions as âNew York Timesâ, âTalkingbroadwayâ etc. both praised and criticized work of actors, the director and the author. Ben Brantley wrote that the author and the director both made a good work to reproduce a feeling of âlifeless"" in such a big city as Manhattanâ, but after the half of 90-minutes-musical, the play turns into an absolutely sentimental work. In the review of âTalkingbroadwayâ it was said that Daniele`s part of the work was fine but unexceptional and didn`t fit for genius LaChiusa`s music & lyrics."
"233","Little Mary Sunshine ","    Already from the overture, we can see that the audience is about to see and hear very heroic action with lyrical elements. Taking as the basis the classical musical productions of the 1920s, Rick Besoyan mocks with love at operetta in general and the work of Rudolf Frimley âRose-Marieâ in particular. Each song in the âLittle Mary Sunshineâ is a reference to a specific primary source that allows the viewer not only to enjoy this musical, but also to draw parallels with other classic performances., , The image of Mary is collected from a variety of romantic girls â classic lovers of brave heroes. The ease and clarity of voice of Eileen Brennan especially emphasize the spiritual qualities of her charming character. Vocal data of artist enable the viewer to immerse into the unusual story about the young girl. Although the character based on parody, the fate of Little Mary Sunshine causes jitters in lot of sensitive hearts. , , A more sophisticated audience can find a double meaning in most of the songs of this show, which is questionable advantage. Some critics found this ambiguity unacceptable and provocative. They also reacted to the caricature, which was present in several characters. A certain part of the audience considered the stereotypes existing here as an insult of the Native Americans and women., , Bright colors are a mandatory feature of this production. Redcoats of Forest rangers attract the attention of the audience from the first seconds. Charming long attires of young beauties appeal to the female audience. The choreography of the musical makes a positive impression. Grace of artists & musical dance numbers give a special charm. Even extremely demanding audience will be satisfied with the created characters, as well as their plastics & voices. This spectacular raises serious problems, like a dispute over the land between the Indians and the authorities. The author of the musical did not hesitate to show sides of both, indigenous inhabitants of North America and officials. Injustice, which previously existed in the United States with respect to the local tribes, still exists in our days. Reservations, where most of the indigenous inhabitants of the country are, exist till today. Only when the true equality of people of all races and nationalities will become an inseparable part of the American reality, the political issues raised in this musical will lose their relevance. , , If you do not pay attention to the double implication of some lyrics, this show is an original piece, filled with fun and cheerful characters. Thus, it is suitable for all ages of beholders. Viewing this will deliver the spectator a lot of fun and optimism."
"234","Little Me ","    Belle Poitrine is not only the main character of the musical, but its main decoration. She is able to arouse in the audience radically opposing emotions. Someone will love the heroine, while others may criticize her lifestyle. One thing is for sure â there will be no one indifferent left. Such strong characters appear too rarely in the real life, so we should pay attention to them. Actress Faith Prince has done fantastic job. The acting was complicated by the fact that prior to her role of Belle has been played by two magnificent performers, Virgina Martin & Mary G. Murray. This created strong pressure on Faith. But, as we can see at the output, the actress wasnât bending under the stress and showed the audience really strong game. Her Belle looks lively, purposeful heroine, able to make any sacrifice to achieve her goals, no matter what the trigger was and will the result, achieved in the several years from the beginning, will match her initial trigger., , The choreography & music are two more components, thanks to which this show has managed to reach such heights. Among the compositions, dominate mysterious notes that the really savvy people will feel in a chic music background, ideally emphasizing main points. The most famous song of creation is considered Little Me â Belle and Belle's Boys performance. It immediately evokes associations with the love affairs of the protagonist. As for the choreography, here it is the most sophisticated and with a hint of flamboyant sensuality. For his elegant work, Rob Marshall received a nomination for the Tony & the Drama Desk Aw., among other nominations for this play, but unfortunately, he did not manage to win. , , Little Me in all its glory demonstrates how to achieve success if to try hard and forget all mudslingers. Of course, the main character has many initial qualities, without which this may have not come true. However, the most important is the tenacity and self-belief. This musical teaches to find a stimulus to reach the perfection and reminds that the hardest step is the first one."
"235","Little Mermaid ","    The first version of the play, with its richness and originality, has not received much support from the audience. In particular, the beholders didnât like much too heavy, ornamented costumes, making a fantastic marine life creatures look like aliens from outer space. Attempts of American actors to create an innovative play without repeating the animated film has not been met by the viewer with support. Not because the performance was bad. Only because the stage production could not overshadow the famous cartoon. , , The audience could not accept artificial ocean, which seemed to them as a piece of plastic. A roller shoes prevented actors to move with that airy ease, which was necessary according to the plot. Too heavy costumes with excessive amounts of jewelry and accessories were not contributing at all to lightness and airiness. It seems that the actors had to strain the memory to recall how to set in motion all these tails, wings and fins. The audience was also not inspired nor with seagullsâ singing, neither with aria of Sea Witch (later, these parts were replaced or reduced)., , More successful was the European version of the play by the Dutch company Stage Entertainment, engaged only in musicals showbiz. The company was able to take into account all the criticism of the US version & to make the show a real favorite of the audience. Score has been reworked a little: the song of seagulls Human Stuff was cut, and the song of the Sea Witch, in which she longs for a return to the old days, has been replaced by other, Daddy's Little Girl. European production was focused now not only on the children-spectators. Now the show delighted the adult audience too. For example, shoes with rollers were abolished, by means of which the actors, depicting the inhabitants of the seaâs depths, were simulating swimming in the sea. Few awkward scenes with rollers were replaced with flying. In the European version, the princess Arielâs little friend, Flounder fish, wasnât a child, but a young man, hopelessly in love with the little mermaid. Witch Ursula became a copy of her prototype from the cartoon. , , Asian production also had a load success. It was not for nothing: excellently designed costumes, fine quality of scene props, acting with love â all this allowed to make an unforgettable show. Composer praised the quality of this play. According to executers of major roles in the musical, the acting was easy and fun, enriching their lives with new facets. A great surprise for the audience was the meeting with Alan Menken, the author of music."
"236","Little Night Music ","    The famous film of director Ingmar Bergman inspired the composer Stephen Sondheim to create unique songs to musical called âLittle Night Musicâ. H. Wheeler wrote the script for this play. History of the Swedish actress and her lover is happening at the very beginning of the XX century. The woman tried to deal with her personal relationships, knowing that she had missed something important in her life. Lover, to which the actress was strongly attached, left her many years ago. The man, who was now well received in her bedroom, wasnât free and woman knew that. He obviously was not going to divorce his wife, to offer his mistress hand and heart. Tired of the emptiness of such relationship, the woman decided to return to her former lover, whom she met again unexpectedly. The lawyer did not know that 13 years ago he has become a father of a nice daughter. Being in suspense of intimate relationship with his young wife, the man couldnât stand to meet with the actress, presenting him so much joy before, when their roads were crosses again., , Tart and a little sad love is felt throughout the spectacular. But such feeling is better than a complete void in the soul. The actress has already experienced fame and loneliness. Now she was looking for someone who could give her true love. Many years have passed since the man left the woman. A new meeting has revived seemingly completely extinguished feelings. Even the presence of the young couple did not become an obstacle to visit the former lover. Amazing woman was still beautiful. The past years have not affected her beauty and charm. The choice for man was quite difficult, but it is quite clear â people are always drawn to love, in whatever form. If the heart has re-experienced romantic feeling, it is senseless to resist â it will still prevail. , , The motives of love sound differently in this musical. They may be sad, passionate and even comical. Irresistible desire of flight soon passes away leaving the flow of memories. This performance particularly reveals the depth of human relationships. The musical work consists of 3/4 waltz rhythms. Those are its clear advantage âagainst this background, other songs start to sound more vigorously. Waltz motifs perfectly superimposed on the general narrative line, saying goodbye to gloomy past. But there is hope for a better future. Even the quiet death of an elderly woman does not cause heavy feelings â there is just a light sadness over the fact that time spent on Earth by such a wise person has already ended. She managed to pass to her granddaughter the most important issue â you should always go for the call of your heart, no matter where your way brings you eventually."
"237","Little Shop of Horrors ","    Phantasmagoric atmosphere of the musical âLittle Shop of Horrorsâ captivates any audience. An unusual story embodied on the stage in a very original way. A small number of participants is among its pros. Small theater companies were able to include this musical into their repertoire thanks to this. The production is particularly noticeable with specific drawing of the audience's attention on the moral principles of the protagonist. Initially, kind and decent Seymour gets under the influence of alien plant and begins to lose his mental qualities. Now, for a florist, actions like killing with his own hands or connivance, which led to the death of another person, are equivalent., , Giant plant impresses with its unusual appearance. Despite the fact that this was a doll, it seems really a living creature. At the end of the musical, its sinister plans make every viewer shudder. Special rejection cause flowers in the form of heads of eaten people. Despite the great comical side of this production, it raises questions about the true nature of human beings. Wonderful voices of Kerry Butler & Hunter Foster in the Broadway production in 2003 were able to convey the feeling of love, which their characters for so long were hiding from each other. Unfortunately, Seymour & Audreyâs happiness was short-lived. But this was expected â you cannot build a normal life, if you become an accomplice of horrific crimes. , , The author of the musical claimed that he wanted to create a parody on science fiction movies of âBâ category, a musical comedy in a general sense, and even on Faust of Goethe. Looking at âLittle Shop of Horrorsâ, you can definitely say that he has managed well to realize own plans. This herb stands in line with Faust, when it begins to seduce and persuade Seymour to illegal actions. As a result, young person commits crimes, to which his soul initially resisted. , , Comedy is a major part in this work. First, it is impossible to look at Audrey 2 without laughing, and only then, you begin to realize that this creature is extremely dangerous. The last scene with singing heads as flowers causes duplicitous feelings. Fun and anxious restlessness simultaneously present in the souls of the spectators. , , Final song urges people not to accept the offer of such herbs. No benefits are worth the human soul. This should be remembered all the time â you never know when you will meet Audrey 2 on your way. This musical may be treated superficially, paying attention only to the humorous part. But if you listen to the lyrics deeply and realize its idea thoroughly, it becomes obvious that the author was trying to convey to the audience true things like importance of life preserving and the fact that it is so easy to fall under temptation to do something improper, seduced by candy-sweet promises of future advantages. This puts the show in one line with âDeity vs. Anti-Deityâ creations and sends the viewer to never-ending battle between Good and Evil., , This spectacular sought to express the hopelessness of people caught in the grip of circumstances that do not allow them to start a full life, as it seems in their heads. It is not necessary in such a situation to wait for an easy solution from an alien plant. The person himself must find a way out of the impasse. It is a pity that Seymour did not dare to confess his feelings to Audrey earlier. If the young man were brave, he already would have learned long ago that she loves him and it would help to avoid the subsequent tragedies, including their deaths."
"238","Little Women ","    Director Susan H. Schulman has done an excellent job. She managed to combine in its creation elements of drama and comedy. Both genres fantastically well fit the right moments, and interact with each other perfectly. The first act mainly filled with comical episodes. The audience sees from the stage maximalism of young heroes, their ardent desire for success, as well as a rich variety of delights of life. As for the second act, it looks much bleaker, because its events take place against the backdrop of the bloodiest stages of the Civil War. Almost all the characters were drawn into this conflict. Someone lost his or her beloved, someone â possessions, and somebody â life. All this finds its reflection in the later works of the main character Jo, which many refused to accept because of the presence in it of a great cruelty and realism of the events described. , , Music in Little Women varies exactly according to the script of creation. Initially, the composer offers the audience airy and light comical songs like Take a Chance On Me, Our Finest Dreams, and others. But at the time when the action on the stage gets more dramatic in nature, music starts to be characterized by greater tragedy. This is illustrated by the following compositions: Here Alone, and Days Of Plenty. Composer Jason Howland has done a really excellent job, so his music sound harmoniously with all the episodes. , , Little Women contains many outstanding and colorful characters, on which it is really interesting to watch. First of all, we should mention Jo. She is a creative person, but war has left the very noticeable mark on her heart. Depicting the considered character was entrusted to the actress Sutton Foster. For the embodiment of the Jo character on stage, she received a second in her career nomination for Tony Award, and confirmed own status as one of the best performers of contemporary theater. Other actors also deserve high praises for their work. M. McGovern, J. Powers, D. Gurwin â all played their parts perfectly, and this became integral in the overall success of the play. , , The musical hasnât been unnoticed by The Broadway League. It received one nomination for Tony and 3 nominations for Drama Desk. Though Little Women did not receive these awards, however, what is more important â staging was able to get a lot of fans around the world. Musical of Susan H. Schulman is considered one of the most beloved works of North Americans. B. Bartley from The New York Times said that watching the story of four sisters living in poverty during civil war, but in fairness to the other, was just like reading the immortal novel by Louisa May Alcott. What to say more â classic is classic."
"239","Liza's at the Palace ","    Sometimes it seems that Liza Minnelli refuses to accept her age and comes up with all new complex tests. In another way to explain this thirty-day marathon is quite difficult. Almost every day, the actress spent on stage for two and a half hours. Besides, she did not stand on one place, but was continually singing, moving & living on the stage. People close to Minnelli repeatedly noted that during the shows she suffered physical and mental exhaustion. We must remember that at that time, actress already passed over 65 years. However, not this math, nor the physical condition prevent Liza to go out every night to her fans and to show them the incredible dedication., , As in the old days, Mrs. Minnelli is trying to look stylish and bright. Throughout the concert, she changed outfits and images. The actress begins her performance in soft white suit. She performs mostly comical composition and reads monologues. This part of the musical takes place without any action, but it is followed by a real blast! Minnelli returns to the stage in a short black dress, accompanied by 4 dancers-singers. From this point, concert proceeds with phase of pure drive. Diva performs a number of jazz compositions, including the Basin Street Blues, Clap Yo' Hands, Jubilee Time & others. Passions subside only in intermission. Subsequent events of Liza's at the Palace continue to be a benefit of one person. The show ends with fully deserved applause, praying the efforts of the actress. , , Liza Minnelli is a good example for young artists. She embodies such concepts as commitment, continuous improvement and love to own work. Talent has many artists, but they will not let you survive, if you do not stick to the above principles. Even in her 65, actress does not do favors to herself and trying to show on the stage the absolute maximum. The composition New York, New York (visit card of Minnelli) is a perfect ending of this show. Liza Minnelli invests all soul, demonstrating the excellent choreography and acting. It is difficult to say when on Broadway will new such charismatic personality appears. Or perhaps, actress will get bored and return to the viewer with a new show?"
"240","Lone Star Love ","    Falstaff in the Wild West is a very unusual spectacle. Moving the action of Shakespeare's play in Texas did not change the essence. Still fat cheater wants to live comfortably at his mistressesâ expense. But, as in the original work, he wasnât successful in doing this venture. Wives of Texasâ cattlemen were much keener than he thought. The lesson they taught to would-be lover, he will remember for sure. That's just not so easy to change his nature. Therefore, retiring at the end from Windsor, the man still continues to be willing to ""cool money and hot women."" , , The musical shows the personal relationship between the two pairs â Pages and Fords. If in the first family couple is in complete trust to each other, in the second the husband constantly jealous of his wife. The latter is afraid of becoming a cuckold, so he does not pay attention to the fact that Aggie loves him and is not going to cheat him., , The relation to marriage of daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Paige is revealed. She does not seek to marry the person wanted by them â her soul longs for true love to the elected person. And moonlit night on the prairie helps her find happiness. Faced with a singing cowboy, Miss fell in love with him with all her heart. Then she began to struggle with her parents and their husband candidates. Anne decided to defend her choice â love prompted that she was on the right track. Only after beholding the married couple, the girl's parents came to agreement with the new spouse of daughter. , , The musical shows the life of the Wild West in a classical manner. Music reflects saloons time. Rollicking cowboy motifs are an integral part of the production. Stormy dances, sometimes passing into the fray of the classic saloon type, allow the actors to show their most extravagant parts. Lyrical theme of duo of cowboy and Miss gives the viewer the opportunity to enjoy not only the violent expression of the rest of the characters, but also a romantic line., , Created in the 80s of the twentieth century, now musical may seem obsolete. Jokes aimed at politicians of that time, not relevant today. The other storylines are still in-demand. Even now, ladies and gents wish to get away sometime from all. Modern married women still must be vigilant to avoid becoming a victim of cheating Falstaffs."
"241","Lord of the Rings ","    If there is something totally fascinating and extraordinarily captivating, that it is this spectacular. In general, with such a crazy amount of money that the creators have spent on the histrionics, they could relax and sit back in their seats, not inventing anything supernatural. Looking ahead, we note that in fact, it was obvious that in the show was invested 25 million pounds. On the way to the Theatre Royal, beholders might have been visited by thoughts, would they endure enough to see the end of the musical? 3 and a half hours, you know, not so easy to sit still. Guests were treated with wine in the lobby. Performance seemed to be composed of pile of Hobbits scurrying around. And more obscure was the dance on stage. Some may not like it, as it wasnât that fun. Fortunately, the main part of musical began on time. Very long evening promised to be fine. , , Lots of impressions must be placed on the poster for luring musical-lovers. The performance was delightful. More extraordinary spectacle is simply impossible to find. Lighting, decorations, effects â all was thoroughly developed to the smallest detail. The feeling was that a beholder not in a theater, but is a part of the magic world of hobbits and faithful servant of Fellowship of the Ring. , , As for the other partsâ¦ Tolkien's plot was fairly shortened. Students prepare for the exams in such way: they find in the Internet a summary of the work, hastily read it and go to the exam. For some, such a reduction is an insult (How can you cut SUCH a product?). But for the majority of the audience, it was quite normal â no one would sit in the hall for 20 hours. So the musical contained main events, only briefly outlining the plot. At some point, it was said that Gandalf was going to meet with some Tom Bombadil. Could anyone remember this character of the universe of Tolkien? Google must come to the rescue: Tom Bombadil was the only secret character, which almost was not disclosed in the creation. It seemed illogical to mention in musical this character. If the creators were going to reflect the most important events only, why this point was included? Although, maybe it was a subtle joke? Total misunderstanding., , Referring to the story, the program has helped, but with regard to the songs, they werenât listed all. It was not always clear what the song is about and why it was inserted in this part of the musical. In general, the music is excellent, but the textsâ¦ something was sung in language of Midlands â a small amount of spectators only could understand that, only ardent fans. A scene, in which the huge spider creeps up from behind Frodo, was ruthlessly spoiled when from the mouth of a monster ridiculous and implausible sound fired, just like a Christmas cracker. In general, viewers would never regret that they saw this show, as theyâll remember incredible talents of the actors, beautiful music and magical Fantasy â universe of Tolkien."
"242","Love Never Dies ","    Many people may wonder about whether it was necessary to create a continuation of the famous musical. Is it possible to repeat or even surpass the now-classic masterpiece? Andrew Lloyd Webber has allowed fans of The Phantom of the Opera to meet again with their favorite characters. Composer planned continuation of the theatrical in 1990. But he really started it only 17 years later. The history of the unfortunate man, who was hiding in the caves of the Paris Opera, and his protÃ©gÃ© Christina continued in New York. Love to the girl did not leave the heart of the mysterious Phantom. The man has reached wealth and success on a new place, but failed to find the happiness. He paid no attention to Meg, trying to win his heart., , Arrival of Christina and her family in New York revived hopes of Phantom for happiness. Attempt to make the young woman again to perform his works succeeded. But this has led to the tragedy â trying to win back the love, Phantom lost Christina forever. The beautiful music is playing at the time of the first meeting of the singer and her MaÃ®tre. In it, we can already hear the approaching disaster. Andrew Lloyd Webber was able to convey the feelings of men and women who parted many years ago, but still love each other. It seems impossible to return to what it was before. Christina made her choice â she chose Raul. But wasnât she wrong many years ago? Whether her current husband is worthy of love, which gives him a wife? Raul did not fight for Christina with the Phantom â he accepted the terms of the bet, and continued to follow them when she decided to perform on stage. , , True love does not give up. It perfectly shows the mysterious Phantom. He has been waiting a new meeting with the beloved for ten years, and tried by all means to return her affection. Raul found himself not so firm in his feelings for Christina. His doubts about the reality of a woman's love to her own husband actually pushed her into the arms of Phantoms. Lost her support, Christina returned to her former beloved. The woman's heart continued to love Maitre, who helped to develop her musical talent. Therefore, she did not resist own feelings, realizing that Raul wasnât that good as he seemed earlier. Phantom, waiting for years, looked much more worthy of her affection. She eventually realized that. But the fate was against their reunion. The death of a woman from the fatal shot ends mutual happiness. , , The amazing performance of Ben Lewis & Anna O'Byrne, playing Phantom & Christina in Melbourne, allowed the viewer to immerse in the mysterious world. Their voices touched the hearts and caused a very emotional response from the audience. Opinions of critics separated, so it is best to see a musical and to make your own opinion about it. The only thing is for sure â Lloyd Webber's music is mesmerizing!"
"243","Love Online ","    The musical âLove Onlineâ represents the new relations that may be established between people in the early twenty-first century. Virtual reality helps in communication, but at the same time sets barriers that may be difficult to overcome. The main characters of the musical are single people who want to find happiness in their lives. They believe that they can rely only on the Internet with its vast number of users. Many sites offer services to find true love. But if they can replace the reality? Virtual meetings convenient if a person is very busy at work or has no extra time or money for dating. Or doesnât want to get acquainted in person because he is cynical. But is it possible to really fall in love, communicating only through the Internet? If you do not see your interlocutor's eyes in reality, nor hear his or her laughter, how can you feel close to your half? Though the virtual communication has its advantages. The ability to know closer the person, not paying attention to the appearance, helps to understand better your interlocutor. Many people donât give a difference to how their Internet-companion looks or smells like, if they are on a common wave. Honesty, it is the only important condition in the virtual communication. But you have to be cautious â even a small lie, said at the beginning of acquaintance, eventually becomes a huge lump of it, when you decide to meet in the reality., , Music of this performance perfectly conveys the complexity of communication between strangers. Daring and energetic, it can immediately become soft and enveloping, which together with the voices of the main singers, makes a good impression on the beholder. The original music is perfectly stored in the brains and then for a long time does not go out of memory. Romance is in almost every note of this work.

Elements of romantic comedy will not leave audience indifferent. Well-designed choreography allows the actors to embody their characters on the stage fully. Virtual reality has become part of our lives. But it will never replace alive communication between people. To build romance in the real world is better than everything. Only then it will be robust. True love knows no boundaries, you know."
"244","LoveMusik ","    Alfred Uhry decided to write the script for the musical after reading the correspondence of the famous composer and his wife. Thanks to this, the audience has witnessed feelings that reigned in the inner world of these creative people. History of Kurt Weill and Lotte Lenya is told to the public through the songs, which he wrote at different times. The fate of Lotte & her husband had many tragedies, but also they experienced the joyful moments. The main one among them in the fate of the characters is a meeting on the lake, after which the young people have decided not to separate. , , Got married, they survived times of fame & faced with the looming nightmare of Nazism. Composer reflected the feelings at certain points in their lives via songs. This allowed Uhry not bind the pieces of music in the plot to the actual chronology of their creation. In the narration, the author chose the songs that he believes were most fully expressing feelings of Kurt & his wife in every period of time. The yearning for better times could be heard in the voices of the performers when their heroes faced with the harsh reality â the Second World War. Becoming refugees, they realized that they would never return to their home country again. Married in the USA for the second time, spouses again tried to find their own happiness. The composer succeeded, but not his wife. , , Lenya survived many difficult moments. In spite of past suffering, the strongest hit was the death of her beloved husband. Although their marriage had an open character, she couldnât stand such a loss. Not withstanding the harshness, a woman was ready to break down, but a loyal friend came to her aid. George Davis gave Lenya purpose in life and later became her second husband, despite his gender world outlook."
"245","Lucky Stiff ","    Lucky Stiff is a dynamic comedy that keeps the spectator in attention throughout the musical. The performance delivered with humor; there are many funny scenes. Looking at the action, you know: Harry â a real lucky one who managed to change the boring life of a shoemaker for a trip to Monte Carlo, full of adventures. And the main winning ticket, which he was able to pull out â is love. , , Opinions about the performance from the audience were mixed. For example, one said that this was a collection of individual scenes and musical numbers, weakly interconnected. The story itself was not innovative, only constant singing. The strength of the play was in a good acting, but it was impossible to receive a really good pleasure., , And here is the exact opposite opinion: Lucky Stiff is a comedic performance that does not pretend to any intelligence. It is for the beholder who wants to escape from the everyday hustle and bustle and want to see something funny. Not sugary family melodrama but a theatrical, where a little of everything mixed. Love, the heritage of millions, the corpse-prankster, exciting game in the casino, and the many obstacles that stand in the way of a supposedly rich heir. Despite all the difficulties, the main character was able to avoid them and to become truly happy. After all, few ordinary shoemakers were able to know about the enormous inheritance, to fight for its reception, to have fun along in Monte Carlo in full power! , , The atmosphere of the 60-70-ies of the last century was conveyed perfectly, as evidenced by the heroesâ costumes and the whole atmosphere of the play. This is a cheerful, positive, and life-affirming piece. Donât believe anyone who says about the primitiveness and superficiality of this show. Musicals as such make life brighter & richer, even may be comparable to the breath of fresh air."
"246","Mack & Mabel ","    One of the main advantages of Mack & Mabel is a simple but at the same time interesting & coherent plot. It does not contain any unexpected twists. All events are moving in a fairly leisure manner. Someone might think that this is a con. Not at all. The absence of paced dynamics gives viewers the opportunity to become better acquainted with the characters, to imbue with their emotions and experiences. In addition, the main heroes of the musical are filmmakers, and so it will be doubly interesting to watch them. Writers, headed by M. Stewart, with maximum quality described each character. M. Sennett became very pragmatic character, often causing in the viewer neutral emotions or little sympathy. Mabel in this respect is much more ambiguous identity, which is characterized by the expression. , , In this case, the musical success on one hundred percent is dependent from the actor's performance. R. Preston & B. Peters have done almost the best roles of their careers. As the columnist of The New York Times Walter Kerr noted, the actors managed to portray on stage completely different characters who, despite all the differences in the nature, surprisingly interact. Artists of the second roles also proved to be quite professional, but in this theatrical they did not attracted much attention. , , Musical accompaniment is truly high quality and diverse. It blends harmoniously into all the musical episodes, once again highlighting their already strong atmosphere. Most of all here are comic tunes, but in the end of this creation, truly dramatic compositions dominate. Fiasco of Jerry Herman at various awards can be easily explained by a completely different musical orientation of the society. At that time, at the peak of popularity were the rock operas, but the composer continued to write the traditional music, to which many fans of musicals are simply accustomed."
"247","Magic Tree House ","    Musicals creators prefer to work with complex dramatic or melodramatic projects most often. This gives them a chance to get on Broadway, to work with the stars of the first magnitude, and to receive the prestigious theater prizes like Tony Award or Drama Desk. But all these creations fit little for young audience that wants to see on the stage an exciting adventure, fairy tale characters and good old-fashioned happy ending. This theatrical is one out of few contemporary musicals that can enchant the younger generation. It certainly is not The Wizard Of Oz, but it also has all the characteristics to enter in the future the list of classic works of fairytales genre. , , Unexpectedly for many, this histrionics received a strong vocal support. Absolutely everyone sings: from adults to young artists & performers of the main roles. The latter possess very strong vocals, which will long be remembered to viewers. It is best manifested in the lyrics of the composition What Would I Do Without You?, executed by charming Jack & Annie. Most of the compositions are entertaining and comical. In addition, a varied background of music also present that perfectly accentuates the atmosphere of every scene. , , Lack of choreographic elements fully compensated by the presence of high-quality scenery and costumes. These both look very original. The fact that for this work the designers have not received nomination for any award is somewhat disappointing, and even outraging. Magic Tree House is perfect for viewing for a whole family. The project has an amazing ability to deliver goodness happening on the stage, even to adult viewers, who lost their belief in tales long ago. This may be the opportunity to get a few hours out of your everyday worries and simply enjoy a good and entertaining story., , Magic Tree House recreates on stage the dream of absolutely all children: departure in an unpredictable journey, meeting various fairy-tale characters, rushing to save the world from mysterious evil forces. For example, the creators of the show allowed younger generation to see, what are a friendship, mutual respect and courage. Such things are rare in the theater and on television for the adult audience. This once again reveals the great cultural value of this piece."
"248","Make Me A Song ","    If you are a great song-lover, then this staging is what you would be glad to see and listen to. W. Finn, a talented and outstanding songwriter, created music and lyrics for this production. We can actually hear his voice, even though the songs are performed by various actors. Their content is acerbic in particular parts. Of course, the voices themselves are quite beautiful. Take, for instance, the one of S. Wilfert or S. Binion. They and all the rest of the cast sing wonderfully from the depth of their hearts. You hear the harmony. , , In fact, it is a four-person musical. Besides those gifted singers, a viewer can also see a pianist â Darren R. Cohen. It is amazing to hear, how he adds his lines between the charactersâ phrases. Thus, he might be also considered one of the heroes. His instrument is just in the center of the stage, so it is difficult not to pay attention. The idea was made up by Rob Ruggiero, the director. Such technique allowed to make the performance fantastically energetic., , This play is the third thing, created by Finn during the last ten years, and it is remarkable. Some of the songs were taken from the other works of this composer, which are not that popular. We can even call the compositions personal, as they reflect Finnâs feelings. But they are not maudlin at all. Letâs just say, they are quite sober. There is probably just one song, which can make the audience cry. It is about a late friend., , The show is full of high spirits, which is able to fill the hearts of the viewers. The costumes are not extravagant as well as the decorations. But such simplicity and kind of honesty are the things, which draw our attention to the stage. The main feature here is the songs (the title indicates it as well), and nothing disturbs us from listening and understanding their content. , , If you adore live music, nice and not too sentimental lyrics, absence of gaud, and are eager to fill your heart with high spirit and energy, you must watch this staging."
"249","Mame ","    It is difficult to define right away the genre of this theatrical. On the one hand, this is dramatic story, telling about a very ordinary, but at the same time a very strong woman. On the other hand, this production is full of comic moments, running in the dialogues, expressions of the protagonist, and so on. If you look deeper, you can even see the presence of distinct elements of satire. In this respect, great talent of creators revealed, along with director, who managed to unite harmoniously within the framework of his creation all these directions. , , We can see that on stage creators and actors receive a real pleasure showing off luxury. It manifests itself in everything: costumes, scenery, the manner of communication. In the air as if the spirit of bohemian life flows. It would seem that the events described here happening against the backdrop of the Great Depression and lasted until the beginning of World War II. But on stage the audience does not see any traces of destruction, poverty, or moral depression. Everything is exactly the opposite. Many theater experts consider this fact the most controversial element of this theatrical. Nevertheless, it is recognized that such an interpretation of the events has the right to live and it looks very ingenious. , , Qualitatively developed characters â another strong point of the considered spectacle. Throughout all length, viewers have seen many colorful characters. Some rapidly gain the love of the public, while others cause mixed feelings. But the most important thing is that no one remains indifferent. The singing fades into the background, giving way to the acting. A. Kansbury, B. Arthur & J. Morgan â all brilliantly performed their roles, earning a number of prestigious awards & love of their audience. This theatrical is one of the most unusual histrionics in its ideas. It has everything to intrigue the audience with unforgettable experience."
"250","Mamma Mia ","    ABBA's songs were so popular that the idea of creating a musical based on them was resting on the surface. But it came to mind only to Judy Kreimer. Thanks to the efforts of the discerning producer, the musical âMamma Miaâ was born. Known tunes included in the golden fund of world music collection. Using them for staging illustrations was a great idea. No matter in whose performance sounded songs of the legendary band â they continued to be provocative and inflaming. Lyrics of Swedish composers in the performance perfectly complement its storyline. They contain simple aspirations of ordinary people. It is due to this compositions, the histrionics became close to almost all the spectators. Experiences of Sophie and Donna perfectly transferred in songs, performed by women at different points in their lives. Wonderfully arranged dance numbers enable the public to immerse themselves in the history of the bride and her mother. , , Musical is built on the theme of love. For Sophie it is a current moment. For Donna â it is almost the past. Rosie aspires to romantic feelings, and Bill is afraid of losing them. Sam is firm in his intention to prove his love to Donna. The play is filled with emotionsâ intertwines. There is love in all its forms â passionate, friendly, parental. Story of Donna and Sam shows that the true feelings of people do not fade with time â they are only waiting for the right moment to shine with a bright light once again. The melodies of famous songs underscore the passion that reigns on the stage during the whole performance. The bright colors of the costumes contribute to the atmosphere of the musical â color flow of 70s perfectly perceived in modern times. The shining of those happy years gives people a good mood â it helps the audience to get a lot of positive emotions from watching this spectacle., , Sincere joy remains for a long time in the soul after the musical ends. Love every moment reminds about its existence. For those who just started its search, this work is a kind of symbol of future happiness. ABBA's music gives irrepressible love to inhabitants of the stage and the beholders hall, and they praise it highly. A good proof of this is the performances, still existing on the stages of theaters around the world. Since the first time of the play, it has been almost 17 years, but it is still a pleasure to the audience. Very famous melodies sound vividly even for those viewers who were born after the premiere."
"251","Man of La Mancha ","    At first glance, comic image of Don Quixote represents very serious concepts such as courage, generosity, kindness and mutual support. The main character of the musical goes to new adventures with one goal â to make the world a better place. In our time, a person, adhering to such principles, likely would be considered insane. Perhaps this is the reason why Miguel de Cervantesâ novel still has the huge success and studied at schools, considered a classic piece of world literature. Behind its satirical and entertaining mask, it shows spectators the real human ideals to which everyone should aspire and along with this â to have a good sense of humor to pass through all the harshness., , This production staged in different years on Broadway 5 times with intervals. In addition, this musical was held in more than 10 countries. Each time the directors were trying to find something new. Sometimes they managed to do it and sometimes â not. In 1965, the great success was waiting for the spectacular. In this version, the creators managed to combine most harmoniously essential components: acting game, libretto & music. , , From costumes and decorations depends almost the whole flavor of this particular production. Sometimes it seems that on the scene is really the 16th century with all its traditions, cultures and attires. All items of clothing, as well as the surrounding objects were elaborated to the smallest detail. Actors walked around the stage in loose shirts, trousers with a high waist. Actresses were gowned in long dresses with puffed sleeves and soft folds. Interestingly, some items of clothing on the central characters were lent from museums. For example, the chest armor of the hero. After the show, everyone could buy a copy of gowns of the heroes. Their prices ranged from $ 55 to $ 80. , , Among the songs, dominate comic-satirical pieces like It's All the Same, or I'm Only Thinking of Him. All of them condemn the policy of the Church, openly demonstrating how it managed ruthlessly with ordinary people at this century. The same applies to the monologues. They aimed at demonstrating the true value of kindness and compassion, as well as to expose the real villains, who, under the guise of piety, were caring only about their own interests. , , Richard Kiley played perhaps the best role in his career. For the embodiment of the Don Quixote character, performer received a number of awards, including Tony for best leading actor. All his skills are evident in the composition Golden Helmet of Mambrino. After that, it is not strange why the actor has been invited to the subsequent Broadway productions for numerous times. Though he received no awards for them, the audience always remembers Richard Kiley as the charismatic Don Quixote."
"252","Man of No Importance","    The musical tells the story of the dream and difficulty of its achievement. Everyone is trying to be perfect, finding himself or herself in the place of the protagonist. Story of the creation of Salome featured in the musical is a symbol of such goal. Each one has its own. Much more important in difficult moments to follow the example of the hero, continue to fight for your success. And never give up. Only those who stand unyielding, reach heights. , , The plot has a classic structure, which manifests itself in the progressive development of events. The audience is well aware of what is happening on the screen. This gives the opportunity to concentrate all attention on the compositions and characters. By the way, the latter turned out to be very interesting. In the initial stages the musical, Alfie causes some suspicion: he looks too naive, but at the same time, purposeful. But then comes the understanding of all the actions of the protagonist. Even there is an ascent on not the most pleasant details of his life, which is not able to significantly affect a positive attitude towards him. Who doesnât have skeletons in their chambers? We all do., , Female characters possess features that characterize the majority of their gender. In the heroines of Lily and Adele the spectator can see the love, emotion, care, short temper and frequent changes of mood. F. Prince & S. Murphy perfectly coped with their roles. Their characters look really alive. , , The musical contains many original and unusual episodes, departing from the established canons of the genre. To take, for example, a song Our Father, along with its accompanying choreography. The audience sees on stage the true expression in the performance of the two men and two women, passing Irish notes to the composition. Moments as such are in abundance. The ability to surprise is the most important feature of the really high-quality projects, like this one."
"253","March Of The Falsettos ","    Sometimes strange things happen to people. They don't know what they want from life, don't understand whom they love. The destiny brings them unexpected twists, which they sometimes don't even guess. This musical is just about it. It is about search for something new, in which it is possible to see well-forgotten oldness. It is about that happiness is nearby; happiness is in being with relatives., , Of course, this show isn't suitable for wide audience. Conflict of an unusual family is considered in it. Marvin suddenly finds homosexual bents in himself. He leaves his wife for other man. However, she doesn't leave their house. There is a desire in Marvin's heart to make a big and close-knit family. In addition, they have a little son. The viewer learns about his internal conflict, fear to appear âas fatherâ., , So what thoughts direct such person as Marvin? Why didn't his wife leave him forever? Why did she finally choose the mental specialist who reminds her husband? Answer on all questions the viewer sees during a performance. This is a two-hour monologue of each character, followed by tremendous music., , Quite unusual structure of the show should be noted. The viewer observes the action, which happens at the psychiatrist. At first Marvin, then his wife and then the little son come to him. It becomes possible to get into an inner world of each character. It is amusing that the doctor seeks to help each of them in spite of the fact that he needs it not less (like most of the shrinks). He is like small child who gives vital advice to other children. , , Music in the performance really bewitches. The viewer won't be left indifferent by both a remarkable voice of the chief actress and a falsetto of the lovely boy. A scene should be noted when all actors begin to sing the song about love with falsetto that it was suitable for the Marvin son's voice. Such songs as Love is blind and I Never Wanted to Love You should be especially selected. These are very touching songs, which won't leave any viewer indifferent. The technical part of the musical is also made at height. Despite the idea that the musical has few scenes, the designer managed to create excellent scenery, which will be remembered for a long time. All this perfectly supplements light. Costumes of actors are very simple as it is the household musical. But it also created very honestly. Of course, it is impossible to forget acting. They have completely coped with this task. The viewer will like both the lovely boy and Marvin who has got confused with his life. All cast plays very plausibly., , In general, the musical leaves good impressions. It is a fine performance about love and family. It is recommended to viewing to everyone who likes these subjects and to those who appreciates an unusual plot."
"254","Marguerite ","    The authors of this musical transferred its story in the Second World War. Love drama has undergone some changes compared to the original. 40-year-old singer has been living with a Nazi, not particularly thinking about what is happening around. Meeting with the pianist, who is younger than she is at 20 years, forced the woman to realize that she wanted in vain to escape from reality., , In an effort to protect Armand, the singer was trying to end the relationship with the musician. But she couldnât withstand separation with beloved, and came home to a young man. Only he was able to understand the internal state of the singer and to realize that Marguerite is not as fun as she seemed to the surrounding people. The love between them was especially dangerous for a musician. His sister was a part of the Resistance, and the girl could have been disclosed because of her brotherâs meeting with the singer. , , Nazi, with whom Marguerite lived, also loved a woman, so he wanted to keep her close by all means. But the man forgot that the local population has never pleased invaders. May it be that some people sided Nazis, but the majority of the French population continued to hate the invaders. When Armand began to be in danger, the singer has done everything to protect the pianist. She gave up her lover, hoping to save his life with that. A woman has not had time to explain her act â it was a payback time for cohabitation with the Nazi. But, dying at the hands of Armand, Marguerite knew that beloved already knew the reasons which have pushed her to write a farewell letter., , Musical shows several lines of love: between Marguerite and Armand, between a Nazi and a singer, pianistâs sister & Lucien. The music is different for each pair â fervent and passionate, dangerous and deceptive, trembling and tensed. Margueriteâs red dress is like a symbol of the tragic end of the fate of this woman. Music helps the viewer to immerse deep in the plot. Michel Legrand created very beautiful melodies â famous composer has not lost the skills over the years. Music gives many positive emotions., , Musicalâs stage design also makes a significant contribution to the recreation of the atmosphere of the occupied city. It allows the viewer to focus on the tragic history of the main characters of the play. R. Henshall with J. Ovenden perfectly embodied the image of the characters., , Despite the beautiful music, the performance did not cause the audience fullness of empathy to the main heroine. According to many critics, the story of the Nazi's mistress much less touched viewers than the tragic fate of a courtesan in famous works of A. Dumas. Yet this theatrical is quite high-quality production, although this piece cannot be attributed to the world's masterpieces."
"255","Marie Christine ","    Marie Christine is a very atypical dramatic story. Initially, in the center of the plot is the classic love relationship, not destined to materialize into something more serious for a number of strong reasons. This creation reveals the class inequalities of protagonists: Marie belongs to the old Creole family, and Dante is a sailor and traveler, not accustomed to living in one place. But with the transition to the second act, the musical adopts a new perspective. Romantic line literally crumbling before our eyes, and on the forefront shown heavy emotions of the main character. At this point emerges a completely different side of Marie, manifested in her penchant for dark rituals, including the ancient voodoo ritual. Certain magical abilities conveyed to the heroine from her mother. She has long struggled with them, but finding herself in a difficult situation, she gave up and fell into the abyss of dark sorcery. Such a complex and multifaceted character freed the hands of actress Audra McDonald. The latter has done her job and was able to demonstrate the transformation to the viewer of her character: from a naive girl in love, to the secretive two-faced woman, capable of killing own children., , Absolutely all representatives of acting troupe, in addition to their artistic talents, have marvelous voices. In the composition of Marie â âYour Nameâ â all mastery of Anthony Crivello appears. Already dramatic song in his performance takes new senses of tragic. As for Audra McDonald â her singing is characterized by a remarkable ability to convey the meaning of music directly to the hearts of beholders. , , Throughout the show, the audience possesses the feeling of presence of the atmosphere of witchcraft. This is due to directors, who were able to transfer to the stage the colors of New Orleans with all its carnivals, witches and so on. Lighting engineers did fantastic job. They throughout the play successfully varied illumination of scenes to keep the mood. This is best seen in the episode with the performance of the composition âMamzell' Marieâ, when the initial light background turns rapidly blue and really frightening things begin to be exhibited. The creators have made every effort to reveal unusual and original things in the best possible way. All viewers were impressed â thatâs for sure., , The performance received mixed reviews from critics. The most influential surveyor from The New York Times, Ben Brantley, noted the excellent vocal performance of Audra McDonald, and said that during the whole concert, he had a feeling of presence of the witchcraft on the stage. M. Feingold from the Village Voice was in solidarity with his colleague, but in an article, he had made a greater emphasis on the importance of Graciela Daniele for the musical. According to him, the director has a huge range of techniques and methods that enabled it to work thoroughly every single scene."
"256","Marvelous Wonderettes","    Critics took this piece quite warmly. First of all, the atmosphere was noted in which the spirit of the school was clearly felt. Timesâ columnist jokingly said that the director did the story on behalf of millions of girls. According to him, the boys would never have given so much attention to the awarding with the title of Prom Queen. And he is damn right about it. , , The story of the play is conducted using pop songs of 50s & 60s. In most cases, these are the songs of the comic character, which manage to convey perfectly the atmosphere of the school of those times. The decorators resorted to rather unconventional methods of arrangement of the scene and background of performance. Throughout the spectacle, the audience watching the only stage decoration â the stage itself. It sounds paradoxical, but it is true. The only difference is that in the latter case we are talking about the school stage, in which the protagonists of this musical act. Recent doing this in order to determine who is worthier to have a title of Prom Queen. Why this choice was made? The fact is that by the end of the musical, the audience has the feeling that they are supposedly familiar with this school for many years. According to decorators, such simplicity is a sober calculation and is not related to any cost savings or whatever. Perhaps, to the creators it would be cheaper to use a frequent change of light mobile prop sets, rather than to build an expensive construction of the school stage. Who knowsâ¦, , The energetic characters, bright dresses and cheerful music are the main attractions of the considered musical. At the time of producing, the actresses had to remember own school years and it should be noted, the image of the graduates fit them up as well as possible. Many spectators behind the screen of lightness and comedy often lose sight of the main message of this production. Among other things, it teaches to appreciate friendship. Showing the prom, director demonstrates how seemingly petty events can spoil relationships of friends. One should always be able to compromise and not to bring solid meaning to unimportant things such as competition for a title of Prom Queen. This is the only way to succeed, to strengthen the friendship and to carry it through the years."
"257","Mary Poppins ","    This is the story based on the childrenâs book. However, it touches very important and serious subjects. It gives us a good lesson, thatâs why it doesnât matter, how old a viewer is. Thus, the first thing that attracts in this performance is the plot. The scenes, which are full of magic and kindness, cannot leave us indifferent. Both kids and adults will love this show. It teaches us, how important is to stay kind, to look deeper into peopleâs souls and never judge by the visual look., , Another thing, which is essential in every musical, is the songs. They are magnificent. The voices are perfect. Every word makes sense here. Separate word must be said about the decorations and costumes. They are not just beautiful â they are magnificent. There is nothing to surprise that one of the productions got an award for the decorations. Moreover, magical effects made on the stage, deserves our attention., , What concerns acting, every version has its stars. However, the performers in each production did their best. And thatâs why the West End version obtained an award for the Best Actress. Nevertheless, there are also critics. Some people might prefer a bit more realism in the musical. And in âMary Poppinsâ there is actually more magic. If you are such type of a person, just donât watch the histrionics. But if you are someone, who wants to remember the childhood and let some miracle into your life, then give this show a try."
"258","Matilda ","    The first thing, which attracts the attention of the audience, is the plot. A little girl, who is only five years old, is in the center of the story. She has a really difficult life, as her own parents seem not to love her at all. Nevertheless, she is very gifted and clever. She never gives up and continues to hope for better life. She is such kind of person who teaches us, how to live right. She cannot bear any unfair things, such as deceit or cruelty towards the others, especially innocent people. Matilda keeps coping with all the difficulties in life. She is a good example of a strong and just personality. We may compare a narrow-minded mother, who is an adult already, but is mocking at the daughterâs love to books and advises to watch TV instead, and Matilda, who loves reading so much. She is only a little girl, but she is much wiser than many grown-ups are., , Another interesting thing is that there is a story within a story. The one about acrobat is perfectly connected with the main line, even though we can understand it only in the end of the musical. , , The composer also did his best, having created the mesmerizing songs, which were perfectly implemented into the storyline. This is one of the reasons why the performance has managed to get such great number of awards. The actors and costumes also deserve our attention., , Some people might think, it is a bit childish, as there are some supernatural things in the plot. The musical itself is based upon a childrenâs book. However, even the adults will like the show. It is understandable for everyone, but gives a very important lesson. Thus, if you want to enjoy a magnificent acting, beautiful music and, of course, an outstanding storyline, give âMatildaâ a try."
"259","Me and Juliet ","    Musical can be attributed to rare stories about the backstage of the world of theater. Especially looks original the idea of displaying performance within the performance. The life of an artist or employee of the scene is not easy. The situation, in which Jeanie was involved, demanded from the girl making a serious decision. It was hard to tell Bob that their relationship leads to nothing. She decided on a cunning trick, when she found her true love. She could quite easily mislead her former friend. But when her interrelation with another man became apparent to Bob, a tragedy almost occurred. Only luck helped the singer to stay alive. Usually calm assistant of director showed qualities of a fighter, when the danger began to threaten to his beloved. Fate was once again on the side of Jeanie and Larry â if Bob did not hit his head on the battery, it is unknown with what the menâs fight would have ended. Love triumphed in the musical not only for this pair. Stubborn director and his girlfriend also found a way out of the difficult situation, which allowed them to resume their relationships. , , As one of the authors noted with humor, this is the first show where nobody dies. Despite the fairly lightweight plot, staging lasted almost a year. Backstage of the theater world was an issue of interest to many viewers. Although profits from the performance turned out to be small, it should not be called the flop completely. One song from the musical became a hit immediately after the premiere. It sounds still freshly after 63 years since its performance. Music of R. Rodgers is easy & pleasant, as always. The lyrics of the songs, despite their simplicity, resonate with every heart. The original story of the musical allows to monitor all details of performance â from everyday rehearsals till the final show., , Initially, the audience did not even realize that the actors have already begun to play. They took the conversation of technicians entering the stage as preparation for the show. R. Rodgers and O. Hammerstein II did not begin with a musical overture not for nothing, but after such a reaction of the hall, they were forced to return it to the beginning. As one of the critics said, the authors were able to convey the true spirit of the work in the theater, which reigns behind the scenes. This allows us to assign this exhibition to productions that deserves the attention of the broad audience. Not all people can get behind the scenes to observe the daily life of all team. This allows to make a musical excursion to the mysterious world of the theater, usually inaccessible to the general public and to get familiar with people, about existence of whom you may have not even guessed."
"260","Me and My Girl ","    The Times wrote the following words about the production: in a time when violent dictators and government men speak, the whole Europe is dancing with The Lambeth Walk. This again emphasizes the good and cheerful atmosphere of this theatrical. , , Through its creation, the producers draw parallels between two very different ways of life. Bohemian noble world is shaken when learns that on the title of 14th Count Hareford claims ordinary cockney, who lives in Lambeth area. Despite the existence of legal grounds, Bill immediately understands that such life is not for him. However, he does not want to give up and tries to acquire gentlemanly manners. This whole process of naturalization looks very funny and amusing. Sometimes it cannot do without the satirical jabs against the rich people, but they carry only good character. The whole absurdity of the situation, in which the rough hard worker trying to pose as a count, is manifested in an episode named Me And My Girl. , , However, with all its comicality, musical raises quite important problems of human achievements and success. In most things, there is some ridicule of the protagonist. However, the finale demonstrates that all have the ability to change and even a simple cockney may eventually become a true Count. It is likely that in his position he will be able to achieve much greater success than some rich snob who cares only about his amusement and entertainment., , Quite rarely viewers have to watch the situation where absolutely all characters are presented in a good light. In this piece, simply no antagonist exist. Even representatives of the Count's family, accustomed to luxury and honed to perfection manners, are sensitive to Bill and his fiancÃ©e Sally. Duchess herself takes first to re-education. As for the girl, in adapting her to a new society, Sir John helps. The only thing where the drama of the musical is â the main characters is longing for his former life. , , Decorators and costume designers done very good work. Bright costumes of the 40s perfectly convey the atmosphere, as well as look great on a background of expensive apartments staged. Speaking of the latter. Perhaps it was the first musical that used such a style of constructing the decorations. With the transition to a new episode, the overall image changes. Every time an impression is made in the audience that during the few-minutes-break creators have managed to build a luxurious apartment on the stage. At the time, this theatrical turned out very innovative project. Today it is known to fans of the theater as a classic of the first half of the 20th century, as well as the standard of warm comedy."
"261","Me Nobody Knows","    Production has received praise by simple spectators and critics. Clive Barnes in an article for The New York Times stated that this musical was one of the most penetrating and exciting in the story. A similar idea was expressed by the publication in New Yorker, noted the fact that the play openly demonstrated the problems of modern society, and called people to unite. But columnist of New York Magazine in its text had a greater emphasis on the analysis of the entertaining part. It says that the rock-compositions by G. W. Friedman very good convey the atmosphere of the urban ghetto, as well as emphasize the emotions of children who live there. The creation received Obie Award as the Best Musical. In the same year, the play claimed on five nominations of Tony and Drama Desk but didnât win any. , , Very rarely social projects staged on Broadway. Cultural value of considered musical is great, because it contains a wonderful directing and a great music score. But its main message is to draw viewers' attention to a number of social problems. In particular, on the low level of life of children from the ghettos. Production does not contain vivid story. Stage shows real-life stories of schoolchildren and their interrelations. Some of them are comedic in nature, others â dramatic. From time to time, R. H. Livingston interrupts the show to demonstrate the social ads, such as, How I Feel by Donna Summer. Last calls citizens to help the island state Haiti affected by a strong earthquake. , , G. W. Friedman has created quite unconventional and somewhat even ground-breaking music. Energetic compositions such as This World and Take Hold the Crutch dominate. They executed by a large number of artists. Vocal quality and choreographic component lose much, but do not forget that 90% of the cast are amateurs. Some of them for the first time came out on the scene. Troupes sing and dance to the best of their ability, but absolutely every its representative gives out incredibly strong energy. Apart from the main songs, the composer created a beautiful background that blends harmoniously with the monologues of the main characters. It usually is quiet melody played on the piano. , , We need to thank to S. M. Joseph, who spent a lot of time in order to attract students to the cultural work. He gave a chance to everyone to participate. The kids received a real opportunity to tell about their problems to the entire country. The teacher did not have any filters in the selection of children's works when he used them. They arrived to the listeners and beholders in their original form. This project must open the eyes of the public to a number of acute problems. To solve them, everyone can participate by uniting and acting as one. No one should remain aside."
"262","Meet Me In St. Louis ","    According to R. Schickel (observer), all the songs were chosen extremely well. In his opinion, it was one of the most successful American musicals of all times. He believed that such positive performances especially in demand at a time when people want to be distracted from issues such as an increase in crime, AIDS, war hostility and so on. , , Here are the most common reviews about the play: âLovely, great story! Successfully delivered retro-play about a typical American family of the early twentieth century. Performance is airy and simple. There is no plot, which would keep the audience in constant tension. Thoughts of heroines are only about clothes, secular meetings and upcoming fair. And about the neighbor (âHe's so cute!â). This performance is for those who want to relax and to watch a sweet family comedy after a busy day.â , , âGreat show! This is an image about the nature of American society. Songs from here are on everyone's lips. If we add to this excellent acting â it becomes clear why this play appeals to many. Especially comfortably to watch the record in the Christmas holidays, which are designed for family vacancies. After the play, a fun and positive mood remains. Actually, this exactly is wanted by creators. Bright rich colors, beautiful songs and a good selection of actors did play almost classic piece. This is fantastically cheerful thing. All the feelings and emotions transmitted to viewers by means of songs and dances. The main character of the play â a father, a family man who is ready to sacrifice everything for the sake of peace and happiness of his beloved ones. The performance is very ""American"" and is sure to impress those for whom family comes firstâ., , âThis is true Christmas musical, which is best viewed during the winter. It is gratifying to distract from all the problems and to watch the life story of an American friendly family, which does not have any problems. From the first minutes, it captivates like a good and kind fairy tale. Beautiful costumes perfectly elaborate the atmosphere of the last century. We can only envy to those who was able to watch this production ""alive"" on Broadway.â, , âMany of fifteen musical numbers can be considered a true classic. Reminiscent of Christmas concerts of old times, when they showed the selections of the best tapes. For lovers of such â it is a real finding. There are several reasons to see this piece. Firstly, it has excellent dance numbers. Secondly, it is interesting to see the picture of the atmosphere of American society in the early twentieth century. This simple and good romantic story is able to bring a smile and to create a good mood.â"
"263","Memphis ","    This work tells the story of bringing people with different skin colors together through music and dance. In 50-ies of XX century in America there was severe racial discrimination. Those people, whose skin was black, were considered second-class population. They did not have such rights and opportunities, which provided to most of the whites. It was not surprising that the black population began to open their own places, where they could feel relatively safe. That's why the arrival of Huey Calhoun in Delray's bar all perceived as an invasion. But then the permanent visitors appreciated the trust of white men to their music. Due to the sensitive nature, DJ was able to understand that in these rhythms is the future of the country. The man went through a lot of stress in order to make not only black people could listen to this fiery music. As a result, he began to put the records of his friends on the radio. The reaction of the audience showed that this music resonates in the souls, regardless of a person's skin color and opinion of his bosses., , Rock and roll music became popular all over the world â their rapid rhythm sounded in almost every country. The path of this music to the audience was very arduous, but eventually it found a huge number of followers among people of different ages, nationalities and races. Fiery music perfectly embodied the spirit. Magnificent dance numbers were created by choreographer S. Trujillo. The stage production involved a large number of actors. Their characters were first witnesses of outcome of rock'n'roll music from underground bars to the bright light. The musical also shows the brutality that existed in relation to the color population of the country. The attack on the black girl because she kissed a white man, now seems wild and abnormal. But it took another 60 years to deal with racial segregation. Even now there are lots of racists live on Earth and even among blacks, which supposed to be strange. The main goal of this play is to delete completely this from the consciousness of the world's population. , , Hot rhythms of this production show that these wonderful tunes can change the world and people's attitudes to each other. The play is filled with cheerful melodies and colorful dance numbers. The final song makes an indelible impression on the viewer. Rock'n'roll remain a lively response of many people to others. This music will always unite people on the planet, especially after Elvis popularized rockânâroll greatly."
"264","Menopause ","    Many viewers often accused musical in excess of naivetÃ© and simulated feelings and experiences of the main characters. But we need to remember who were the creators of this piece. The director, writer, choreographer, sound designer, costume designer â all were women. The cast also consisted exclusively of representatives of the blond gender. Men, who prefer thoughtful dramatic projects, will experience difficulties finding in this show any sense. So if you are a man â please, stay at home or visit the bar at the corner, not this production. But with women it's different. They are reflected in the heroines of the play, sincerely empathizing and enjoying their successes. , , Throughout the musical, the audience sees on stage the same scenery â Bloomingdale's lingerie shop. Such uniformity cannot be considered a disadvantage. On the contrary, after a certain time the audience gets used to the existing situation and as the output, each woman possesses the impression that she had just been to the shop with her friends. Clothing of main characters varies depending on their status. On the strong woman, we see a formal suit, melodramas star is dressed in a bright gown and housewife preferred ugly holiday outfit. It should be noted that the work done to support the show could negate if actresses, performing leading roles, blundered. Fortunately, this did not happen. They demonstrated the audience a perfect acting, and proved their considerable talents. Especially J. L. Matthews shone, whose voice was recognized as a real gem of this production. , , Only a few spectaculars were able to achieve such a true comic effect, using only songs. Throughout the entire production, joy and laughter reigned in the hall. Sometimes it may seem that the dialogues would be really spoiled with fast-comic atmosphere. At the end, beholder supports this very feminine story. Do not look at it to find great meaning. Its beauty lies in the ease, simplicity and fun, demonstration of everyday life., , The project is more similar to an entertaining show than on to musical. However, this did not prevent it to get a lot of positive ratings from critics. L. Fischer from the Internet resource chicagocritic.com advised viewers to stock up with waterproof mascara, because while watching theyâd have to laugh a lot, and sometimes even cry. According to her words, in the creation of K. Lindsey wonderfully combines humor and compassion, as well as bright colors demonstrating the experience of women aged 40 and 50. G. Kagy from Daily Californian shortly and concisely praised the theatrical, calling it clever."
"265","Merrily We Roll Along ","    It is difficult to find an answer to the question why the musical flopped at the box office. And it hasnât been saved neither by positive response from critics, nor by the presence of two prestigious awards. Most likely, the audience was frightened off by the complex structure of the plot. Without specific knowledge of how events of the production unfold, it is very difficult to grasp what is happening on stage. So, it may be considered as produced for insiders only, not for theater-goers. However, more sophisticated beholders could experience the essence of the project, and appreciate its beauty. Still it was closed too soon. , , Scenario is built in such a way that the story of the central character Franklin Shepard is told in the reverse order. Initially, the audience sees highly experienced and well-known figure of show business, but then musical gradually rolles back and on stage appears ambitious young man, only planning his creative achievements. Such structure opened many additional features to disclose the nature of the central character, to create deeper and more meaningful dialogues. Viewers had the wonderful opportunity to track changes in the behavior of the main line, to analyze mistakes and make a conclusion allowing not to repeat them in own lives. , , While in the most part of musicals comical element gradually replaced by a dramatic, everything is the other way around here. From the first minutes of the performance on the stage the real drama unfolds that subsides only at the end of the first act. While viewing, there is the presence of a certain feeling of hopelessness. Viewers know how sadly story ended, but because of it, they want to help the protagonist to choose another path. The reigning atmosphere of the show best emphasized by compositions of Stephen Sondheim. And they not only look harmoniously as a background, but also well-performed by artists. Our Time should be highlighted, which wonderfully emphasizes essential meaning and unites the individual parts. Many experts have repeatedly noted that during the work on this histrionics, the composer created the best soundtrack in his career at that time. , , Unlike the spectators, who partially misunderstood the idea of musical, critics have expressed a positive impression of what they saw. Columnist of The New York Times noted the dramatic component of the project, saying that being a fan Stephen Sondheim is equivalent to break your heart every 20 minutes. Theatre expert Clive Barnes wrote that the spectator should not judge this creation based on reviews of other spectators â only the personal opinion should be formed. In 1982, the show received a nomination for a Tony Award, and was able to win Drama Desk & Theatre World. In April of the same year, record was released on LP album, containing major music pieces. Particularly, Not a Day Goes By, Old Friends & Our Time."
"266","Milk And Honey ","    This musical might seem quite unusual. It is not just a typical story about Americans. Here a viewer might get acquainted with the other country, its culture and spirit. The audience might see & feel the love towards the native country, though the patriotic idea has not considered to be the main one. , , The main thing in the story is finding love. The Americans try to find one in Israel, and some of them really succeed in it. However, there is a moral issue in the story as well. The mail character, who has come to see his daughter, falls in love. But he is married. First, the woman he likes, cannot admit this fact. And after some time, he himself understands that it is not right. Even if he has been far away from his spouse for many years, he must divorce and put an end to their relations before starting a new affair. He finally chooses to do the right things, but we canât still know, whether he will redeem his promise. , , Another interesting thing is the costumes. They really deserve the attention and praise of the audience. The musical was even nominated for an award in this category. What is more, all the members of the cast are gifted. They were able to transfer the main features of each character. The songs perfectly match the show. It must have been hard to find a good composer for such task, but the creators have managed to do it. Almost every composition from âMilk and Honeyâ has become a hit., , Thus, if you want to enjoy special atmosphere of Jewish country, to know more about its culture and, of course, to listen to wonderful music by the great composer â you should watch âMilk and Honeyâ by all means. The light plot, which contains an important moral, will not leave the audience indifferent."
"267","Million Dollar Quartet ","    As soon as it comes to such genre as rock and roll, in memory immediately occur the names of legendary singers: Elvis, Jerry L. Lewis, C. Perkins, Johnny Cash and others. F. Mutrux & C. Escott decided to remind the younger generation about the contribution of these people to the world's music. By creating own musical, the authors have told everyone about the wonderful rock'n'rollâs flow. Recording the songs by a unique team, which included Presley, Lewis, Cash and Perkins, had to become a masterpiece, which pleased millions. Rock and roll performances of those days recorded by legendary musicians sound till today, but most people would like to see live what was happening then on the Sun Records studio. This histrionics helps to present a fiery music situation that prevailed when the future hits were recorded. , , Deciding to watch this spectacular, the audience actually gets onto the concert, on which sounds the world-famous songs. Leading actors fully included in the images of legendary musicians. Due to such impact, they are able to bring a hundred percent on the stage of energetic rock-and-roll spirit. Hot rhythms reveal the atmosphere of XX century to people of nowadays just as they did with the generation of the 50s. To depict these stars on Broadway, producers picked wonderful artists. Due to voices of E. Clendening, L. Guest, L. Kreis & R. B. Lyons, they fantastically impersonated famous singers, whose images they embodied on stage. The energy flowing from that performers, allows the viewer to immerse in the early days of rock'n'roll. , , Thanks to the 6th sense of the owner of Sun Records studio, world could learn about many unique musicians who have become legends. Mr. Phillips was able to catch new trends â unusual melodies created in the 50s, found understanding in this person. Over the years, rock'n'roll did not lose its positions. Even after the arrival of new rhythms and new wave, one of bright representative of which was recently deceased David Bowie, fans continued to listen to RânâR. People could not imagine their lives without this heart-felt music. Passion and vigorous boiling of rock'n'roll tunes never allow to sit still. These rhythms resonate, forcing you to move in pace with the music. , , The upcoming musicalâs display is planned on the stages of many theaters in the 2016-2017. Effervescent spectacle and energetic music will bring a lot of fun to the fans of this genre and to lovers of great music in general."
"268","Miss Liberty ","    At the heart of the musical is the second book of Robert E. Sherwood. Music & lyrics were written by famous composer Irving Berlin. The project tells the partly fictional story connected with the symbol of America â Statue of Liberty. The hapless journalist goes in search of a woman who was the model for the statue. He mistakenly believes that this Frenchwoman named Monique. The news of this with the speed of an arrow flies all over the world and this leads to unpredictable results. In addition to other compositions, in the production sounds the sonnet of Emma Lazarus named The New Colossus. The words of last are on the monument underneath the statue. During the World War II, Robert E. Sherwood was deeply moved when he learned that the Statue of Liberty is the last thing soldiers see going abroad. He decided to write a story about this symbol of freedom come what may. , , The project contains elements of comedy, drama, as well as a distinct romantic line. But the quality of all these components raises many questions. Moss Hart failed to combine them harmoniously within a scope of a single musical. As a result, we see a lot of potential comedic episodes that did not produce the desired effect, and then transfer into drama unexpectedly. The only thing that looks on its place is a love line between Horace and Monique. The latter is filled with pure and sincere feelings, containing a slice of expression and spontaneity. It is likely that the unification between the main characters symbolizes friendship between the French and American nations. Similar symbol, only the material one, here is the Statue of Liberty. , , Most of the music of the project executed with piano accompaniment. The songs are characterized by a certain variety. There are dynamic jazz songs and classical music, sung by a professional choir of Norman Luboff. It is interesting to look at the scenic elements. Most often, these are the huge photographs depicting real places of New York and Paris. With this background perfectly combined lush, grotesque outfits of main characters, as well as the classic costumes of trio of heroes. Generally, all that related to installation, maintenance and other auxiliary work, performed in the musical for A++, for which it even was awarded. , , The creation shown partly real, partly imaginary events associated with the symbol of American freedom â Statue of Liberty. Creator Robert E. Sherwood has repeatedly said that by this project he wanted to instill in the audience the well-understood feeling of patriotism. World War II just ended, so the emergence of such a play looked quite logical and justified."
"269","Miss Saigon ","    The structure of considered creation is more like an expensive Hollywood movie rather than a musical. Creators managed to combine harmoniously all theatrical elements: acting, music, singing & scenery. The project is based on the story of love without happy ending of two very different people. He is an American infantryman. She is Vietnamese prostitute. The first thing that unites these characters, besides love â is horrors of the Vietnamese War. The producers were able to reveal the atmosphere of the tragic events of 70-ies very good, mainly thanks to the scenery design and costumes. It is rare when the creation of scenery takes so much time as here. So it received extensive and sophisticated elaboration to the smallest detail. , , Throughout the musical audience can see the following picture: the brothel with its bright commercials; Vietnamese slums and American classic apartments; the headquarters of the Communists with its characteristic symbols and a huge statue of Ho Chi Minh; helipad, where soldiers gathered before sending home & many other locations. Depending on the setting of the scene, costumes change. The brothel is so perfectly revealed by forthright outfits of women working there; at the headquarters of Asians, the audience sees the classic headdresses, which are rice hats; camouflage military uniform is observed on the base of the Americans. The scenery in combination with the above-described clothes gives to each episode colors and emphasizes its special volumetric atmosphere., , J. Pryce & L. Solonga coped with their roles tremendously. Through her character, the actress shown viewers such traits as naivety, trust and hope. Over time, the war changes Kim. This is clearly seen in the episode, when she kills her brother, which threatened her child. Maybe years back, she would agree her brother killed a boy, but now she is hardened and was able to defend own little piece of love. Solonga was able to convey the transformation of her character thoroughly, for which she received a Tony Award â well-deserved, along with 1 Drama Desk. As for Pryce â his character Chris is the epitome of the American male. Initially, he seems like the perfect hero, but then some things happen that turn upside down the viewer's attitude towards this character. , , The musical accompaniment is filled with clearly heard oriental notes. Songs are usually dynamic and contain no drama. The last one is also fully manifested in the dialogues and speeches of the main characters. The vast majority of viewers & critics have warmly accepted the project. But there were also those who saw in the creation elements of racism and sexism. In particular, the founders accused the disrespect towards women. According to Hideo Maruyama, people should open their eyes and to see the real Vietnam, rather than what is shown in the play. Maybe he is right today, but not for times that were 50 years ago. Things change, you know. , , In 1991, the project has received 11 nominations for the Tony, winning 3. The spectacular also has 5 Drama Desks and Theatre Worlds. In 2014, the long-awaited return of the creation happened to the West End. During the first day, it sold tickets for more than $ 4 million. This figure is an absolute world record as of today. In 2016, the same-named movie is planned, with Danny Boyle as director."
"270","Most Happy Fella","    It is an amazing story, which may touch the hearts of everyone. There is no politics or religion here. All that a viewer can see is just life. âMost Happy Fellaâ is a wonderful love story with a happy ending. However, it might become the reason for some people not to like it, because it is not always so in reality. In everyday life, we face injustice, lies and cruelty. The situation does not always end happily. People may get hurt. But in this musical, it is not so. , The performance brings hope and inspiration to those, who are ready to receive it. The actors play wonderfully. They manage to transfer the emotions of their characters. There are lots of songs in the show, perfectly matching the scenes. That is why it is called an opera. So, any opera-lover will be glad to watch and listen to this histionics. The audience can also enjoy plenty of dances, which cannot leave indifferent., The most important lesson of the musical is probably that you can always find happiness. It does not matter, how old you are. Besides, it points out that the age difference is not vital in love. What is more, the happiest man is the one, who is able to forgive the others for their mistakes. Thatâs why the performance is titled so., This spectacular has become prodigiously successful. It has had several revivals on the stage. People still want to watch it, as it is quite true., Here you will like costumes and decorations as well. Enjoy beautiful voices, talented acting, nice songs and creative dances. You will see that the musical has deserved all its awards and nominations. Fantastic costumes were not the highlight of this histrionics. The essentials here belief in yourself, dedication to the object of your love. You should not give up even if someone tells you that you arenât good enough to do what youâre doing (or too old to love). Remember â when people say âyou canâtâ, they define their limitations, not yours."
"271","Motown ","    It is not just a plain spectacular â it is an amazing trip though the life of a famous and talented person and his friends. The production attracts the audience for its story, which is a real one. The viewers see, how the talents are discovered, and how people try to reach their dreams. All the obstacles and hardships are displayed. We may see what a great job has been done by Berry Gordy and his mates. Their relations are also a part of the storyline. They are both professional and friendly., , The main thing in this performance is, of course, the songs. All the well-known hits, recorded by Motown, are presented here. The voices of the singers fit the songs perfectly. You can see a young guy, playing Michael Jackson and many other unbelievably gifted Afro-American actors and actresses. The performance of the leading actress, playing Diane Ross, is outstanding. The dances are wonderful thanks to a talented choreographer Patricia Wilcox. The costumes should also be mentioned as one of the benefits of the musical. They are not just mesmerizing, they reflect the time of action. The designer did the best creating them. The hairstyles also deserve our attention. They are original and match the time, when the spectacle takes place., , Certain critics tell that the show lacks the storyline. It is true, as there are more than fifty songs, some of which are performed as concert versions. They claim, the performers come and go away too fast. Thatâs why those people, who prefer to concentrate on the plot, will probably not like it. But all the rest will be able to estimate highly the miraculous work of the actors and their abilities to sing and dance., , Despite the criticsâ response, the production has become very demanded and popular among the audience. So many performances have been shown since its opening in 2013. In 2016, it is going to be revived. It is possible to book tickets already. It possibly denotes how people like this simple and true performance. The reason probably lies in the songs. They are legendary and will remain famous for a very long time. They still touch our hearts despite the fact that they are old enough., , In this musical, there are no complications, no drama or tragedy. All we see is just life of the main character, who is working to fulfil his dream. His past, present and all his way through life are displayed. It seems there is nothing special, but we still like it. If you want to listen to beautiful songs, enjoy interesting costumes and see magnificent dances â watch this musical & get pleasure."
"272","Movin' Out ","    Staging of this play is quite unusual. Cast is dancing and only with solely movement should transmit the lyrics & the stories of their characters. The performance is more like a rock ballet rather than the classical musical. The author has managed to embody the idea of all hopes and aspirations of young people, the horrors of war, the pain of loss and disappointment. Boys have suffered much at the front, and now they could not return to their former carefree life. Suffering because of the war syndrome, each of them was looking for a way out of this difficult situation. Tony & Eddie differently got used to civilian life. One young man was trying to get closer to his beloved, and the other wanted to get rid of the memories and aggression with the help of drugs. Only sincere feelings healed the suffering soul. Eddie realized this only after a meeting with a widow of his friend. The life story of five friends ends with reconciliation with oneself and with the world around. Now they can look forward again, hoping to find peace and happiness in the future. , , Born in the songs, characters came to life on stage. They showed the public their hopes and disappointments, joy and pain, love and suffering. Ordinary boys and girls did not think that the fate would provide them such serious tests. But they managed to overcome everything and began to live again. Energetic songs and passionate musical, along with ardent choreography helped the viewer to understand each movement of the actors. Various life situations are embodied on the scene â from youth party to the mourning ceremony. The dancers bring to the audience a deep sense of music that sound in the play. Color setting also helps the viewer to experience musical better. Thanks to the excellent performance of the songs, the show fully captivates the attention of the public and becomes a joint thing to everything that happens on stage. , , In this performance, a beholder can see almost the entire range of life situations. The basic idea of staging is that sincere feelings will always help to overcome adversities. The main thing is timely support of your closest people. You should also adhere to self-trust. With all this help, you can endure the difficulties and troubles that have arisen in the course of life of human. It is only necessary not to alienate those who want to give you support. Love brings to people's lives a sense of joy and happiness. The main characters prove it on personal experience. Despite wounds, Tony and Eddie could find comfort in the words of those who were not indifferent to their fates."
"273","Mr. Mark Twain ","    Musical creators initially refused to pursue goals such as commercial success, receiving various kinds of awards and prizes. The main objective of the project was to tell the audience the story of one of the most iconic writers of American literature, Mark Twain. Every person knows his name, but not all are familiar with facts from the biography of the novelist. Staging created to consolidate the existing knowledge of the audience and significantly increase them. Based on the foregoing, it becomes clear why the director Dennis Rosa did not limit the scope of his creation with one theater and demonstrated it in more than 50 cities in America during the touring company., , In order not to stuff to the eyeballs the audience with dry biography, directors significantly diversified the narrative line and included in it the scenes from the popular works of Mark Twain. In particularly, we are talking about a variety of theatrical cameos from the novels with Tom Sawyer. This fact significantly increases the value of the cultural performance and diversifies it. The life of a writer can hardly be called fun, and because of these scenes, the audience laughs, the atmosphere of drama on scene dilutes., , Mark Twain was an outstanding personality, and therefore his embodiment on stage was entrusted to an experienced actor. Him was William Perley. He smartly coped with his work, literally fitting in the image of the writer. The rest of the performers also did their best, though they devoted to stage time not many efforts. It is logical that in this situation to the foreground come costumes, scenery and other elements. The picture was a little pretentious, but not less magnificent from that. A variety of scenery prop amazes: the modest apartment, wide deck of the ship, where Twain worked and travelled extensively in the South USâ¦ They most accurately convey the frequent change of the situations in the life of the novelist, as well as the huge number of places, which he was lucky to behold. Thanks to these creations, people have the opportunity to get acquainted with this person, one of the greatest literary figures in history. Millions of people know the story of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, but now they can clearly see the way of life of creator of many aforementioned characters."
"274","Mr. President ","    This musical is strongly connected with politics. It is not just a story about love affairs; everything has its hidden motives. We may see it from the romance between the daughter of the President and her lover. He leaves her, when the term of her father comes to an end. , , There is a serious issue in the plot. The background of the performance is the Cold War. Here we see how the leader of the state tries to improve the situation. And he succeeds. Even though he is not praised for this for the first time, his hard work is awarded later., , Of course, the plot is not the only thing, which attracts people. It is probably something, people actually do not like. Many of us can say that the spectacle is out of date. It might have been interesting several years ago, but not now. They subject matter is not that relevant for the people. The plot is considered weak. , , If we speak about the music â the songs are good. They have been rewritten several times. It was also the last work of the gifted composer Irving Berlin. He was full of inspiration and tried to create fresh melodies. This was one of the reasons, why the musical is worth seeing and listening. , , The actors deserve the attention as well. Look at Nanette Fabray, who was playing one of the leading roles. She resembled the first lady of that time â J. Kennedyâs wife. The creators decided to exploit this likeness. And the first lady highly-estimated the show., , The first production failed, but the tickets were sold beforehand, and many people watched the musical. Even after many cuts and revisions, the situation didnât change. Despite the dull scenario, the work of the cast and all the troupe was fantastic. The director was talented enough, while the songs became hits. In 1963, the show won Tony Award for the Best stage piece. It was nominated for the same award for the Best Leading Actress, Conductor and Musical Director. At least for a few reasons the production should be seen. They are directing, music, lyrics and talented acting. A viewer must be ready for the boring plot and absence of action. If you are not too critical concerning such things, then you can watch this histrionics and enjoy fascinating work of the crew. It will be also exciting for those, who prefer something retro-style."
"275","Music Man","    It is quite interesting to watch a musical about the music. First thing, which makes us admire, is the songs. The talented composer â Meredith Willson â was inspired by his own boyhood. He spent it in Iowa and understands the spirit of that place. Outstanding melodies and beautiful voices of the actors made the performance mesmerizing., , Concerning the plot, it also deserves out attention. It is a kind of mixture of comedy and romance. The story itself gives us an important lesson. Everyone can become better, when s/he falls in love. Sometimes we donât even notice it, but our beloved change us. , , The staging immediately became popular among the public. It is proved by so many revivals of the show and a movie adaptation. Each production features gifted actors, singers and dances. Choreography should be mentioned as well, as dances take a great part of the performance. Onna White really did her best in her task. The audience likes both the original and the new versions of the musical. Many people say that Craig Bierko managed to return old ideal of an attractive man in a leading role. Being a fraudster, he makes us like him anyway. The performer perfectly showed the shifts in his character. We see, how he becomes better and understands, what is important in life. , , Rebecca Luker appeared to be perfect main female character. Her heroine is gentle and lovely, but she also has strength and principles. Here you can find plenty of references to the culture of that time. Those, who are interested in history, will highly estimate it. The show is often called a Broadway jewel. It should be watched by all the musical lovers. You will definitely like everything here â songs, dances, costumes, actors and the plot. It is a reflection of talents and creativity. The staging deserved every award, it has obtained."
"276","My Fair Lady ","    This work is one of the best musicals of the world. An unusual story about a girl learning the subtleties of high society communication won the audienceâs hearts across the planet. Staging has been recognized as an outstanding immediately after the premiere. Initially, a professor of phonetics was not sure of his success when he took a florist girl as a student. And yet the idea of showing that any person with appropriate training can be perceived as the representative of high society, was very interesting for a man. He decided to conduct an experiment, and the object of it was Eliza. She did not think that the lessons could be so boring â she did not want to repeat the same phrase over and over again in a row. But, being able to pronounce the words correctly, florist assessed her capabilities â she could be a real lady! Reaching the maximum success at the embassy ball, she was very happy. But her joy was marred with an attitude of the professor. The man still saw her as just rootless flower girl. , , Henry Higgins did not notice how Eliza has changed during the time that she spent in his house. The girl herself was not fully aware of this. Only when the she tried to go back to the old life, she realized that continue living in her old way was impossible. Thanks to Professor, her fate has changed, and making a step back was unacceptable. Back at the house of Higgins, she saw that the man is aware of his not best behavior in relation to her. Realizing his feelings, Eliza decided to stay with him, even though she had the opportunity to start a relationship with another noble young man. Yet the one who spent at her education a lot of efforts, appeared for the former florist much more important than Freddy, a new acquainted. She decided to forgive her former teacher for the coldness and harshness as he was a man who won her heart., , Immediately after the premiere, the musical has attracted the attention of the public. Critics appreciated the histrionics as the first class. Particularly subtle irony and wisdom present in the plot were noticed in reviews. Excellent performance of actors taking part in the musical also caused the admiration of critics. The play received numerous awards â many prizes marked this production. Amazing performanceâ numbers entered into the world music collections. Songs of F. Loewe featured a special lightness and melodiousness. This musical has entered into constant repertoire of many theaters of the world. The spectators do not miss the opportunity to see this magnificent spectacle to enjoy a well-known musical numbers, wherever it is played at the moment. Because it is a Cinderella told in the new way â a rich person gathers a girl from the street in the literal sense, makes a gorgeous person out of her and takes her to live along with him. This is a dream of many-many girls."
"277","My Favorite Year ","    Musicals managed to win several major theater awards including Tony, Theater World & Drama Desk. In particular, actress A. Martin has been awarded with two prizes at once. The reaction of critics was not so supportive. Columnist of The New York Times F. Rich called this creation a missed opportunity to glue a truly high-quality comedy. According to him, the show looks very noisy and has a relatively flat music. A similar idea expressed in publication of Time Magazine, briefly describing the production as barren Broadway musical. , , Many people wonder why despite the existence of numerous awards and nominations the musical has rather weak ratings. The main reason â the creators of this project tried to fit it in the frames of film of 1982. But the movie and the scene are different art forms, which need separate approaches. At the disposal of the movie, it was one of the best actors of the 20th century, Peter O'Toole, with his incredible charisma and skills. There was much less opportunities in spectacular. But at the same time, it should be noted that the absence of a vivid artist has given a chance to prove themselves the rest of the actors. Andrea Martin managed to receive two prestigious awards. L. Kazan perfectly played a role, but she had not been able to get the cherished statuette â she landed with the nomination only., , It is evident that the director R. Lagomarsino in most episodes preferred to use the whole cast. One or two artists on the stage appear rarely. This can be seen only in the middle of the musical, at the time of meeting of Benjy and Swann. In the rest of the scenes dominates mass usage of a variety of images, scenery, choreography and vocal elements from a pile of actors. All of this is manifested best during the execution of the composition âTwenty Million Peopleâ: there were more than 20 people on stage, singing and dancing. For such techniques, the creation received a considerable portion of criticism. However, this may be loved by fans of improvisation and welter on stage. , , Musical accompaniment also causes mixed feelings. It sags quite often and thatâs why it is really hard to understand the atmosphere on a scene. Therefore, comic component of production loses a lot. This is clearly illustrated by the song âThe Duck Jokeâ. The latter was created in order to cause the sincere laughter, but eventually raised only a few smiles. The only bright moment of the show is the background music. During its creation, S. Flahery slightly shifted away from the main theme of the histrionics and added to it a certain touch of drama. As a result, piano composition named âLarger Than Lifeâ appeared. It is considered the main decoration of this ambiguous creation."
"278","My Name will always be Alice ","    Sometimes the viewer goes on musical action, wishing to see something deprived of sense, but at the same time fascinating and flamboyant. If the person is one of such audience, then he or she will like 'My Name will always be Alice' by all means., , The musical strikes with its ease and brightness. It is worth noting that the show is created in format of revue. Despite this, it can seem to the viewer that all performance is a single whole. All this occurs because actresses harmoniously supplement each other. People can think that they observe history of the same woman during different periods of her life â from childhood to maturity. Perhaps, this is true. What did creators want to tell, besides of a life story, is unknown. However, one thing can be told precisely: they managed to create a remarkable set of sketches of 21 songs., , As for music in the show, it is tremendous. It is especially necessary to note All Girl Band, which sounds at beginning of the show when all five actresses sing the inflaming song in brilliant dresses. Of course, the main emphasis of the musical is placed on songs. As for choreography, the viewer shouldn't expect fiery dances. However, it doesn't mean that it becomes boring because of it., , The visual part of this play is also of a high level. There is a desire to tell many good words to the designer of scene and suits. Thanks to various clothes, actresses instantly reincarnate in different images. So the beholder sees the young girl with mother, and then already two friends. Scenery weren't same various as suits. The reason for that â initially the spectacular was designed for a small scene. However, masterful lighting supplements and hides all the shortcomings. Design of the scene was created in style of the 80th years of America. Describing general impression from the show, it is possible to tell that this is remarkable musical for people of almost all ages."
"279","Mystery Of Edwin Drood","    Classical plot of Charles Dickens' novels always is also long and various. It isn't easy to reflect it in series. In the musical, this task seems impracticable at all. Not to get out the framework of time, its creators had to cut down all events strongly. Actions are promptly replaced, and the viewer doesn't have time on judgment of situation. It is impossible to tell that these circumstances have done it good., , If to speak only about a technical and visual component, then it is thought over ideally. Smart design of the scene, suits, tremendous atmosphere of the Victorian England: cloudy sky, big houses, a stone cemetery. There are little locations in the musical, but all of them are thought over unusually and arranged, and except some things, literally each detail breathes that era., , Unfortunately, it can't be told about semantic contents. Dickens's plot was godlessly shredded, having left only those lines, which, according to creators' opinion, have values for continuation. In places where the author has long explaining details, in musical there are one, literally the second strokes. It inserted as though only for original plot following., , Itâs necessary to say several words about music and actors. The magnificent music, sounding from the beginning, penetrates the musical, adding depth to images of characters. It is capable to lodge in soul of the person for a long time. The main character Jasper is a regent of church choir. Therefore, bel canto, a fine man's vocal, is closely connected with his image. There is also a fine visual row, a set of symbols demanding a solution., , But the most amazing part in the musical is actor's play. Especially should be noted John Jasper's role. His ability to play the villain, causing sympathy at the same time is inherent only in great actors. The passions, which are tearing apart Jasper, this quiet person, love, involved on envy, hatred, which has arisen in his soul because of dislike of the father is embodied in really heart-breaking scene of his suicide in the final of musical., , Before going on this performance, the viewer has to be ready that he/she will see some shortcomings. To transfer a plot of classical novel is a really difficult task. Creators have coped with this problem not ideally. However, the musical is worth watching all the same."
"280","Myths And Hymns ","    Complete denial of worldly needs resulted in a strong confrontation between the two generations of the same family. If the parents were happy with quite ordinary life, their children wanted for something more. The turning point in the relationship between father and son occurred at a time when the man realized homosexuality of his child. Because it was considered a sin, the patriarch of the family decided to renounce his boy. His religious feeling took over his father's. But when the young man died because of AIDS, father bitterly regretted about his decision. Only after losing a beloved one, he realized that everyone could live own life, no matter how strange it seemed to people around. , , Man slightly outlived his son. Remained almost in the same time without children and without a husband, a woman could not live with it. Her daughter also suffered the loss. She unsuccessfully tried to fill the appeared void with new love relationship, but they brought her only suffering. When the family's financial situation deteriorated, the house was put up for sell. But the widow refused to leave it, being perseverant in her denial. , , The author has written Song of Icarus in 1987. It was the first product of the future collection, on the basis of which the final musical has been formed. Inspired by Greek mythology, Adam Guettel continued to create a cycle of music compositions on the subject. In 1993, the author purchased in a secondhand bookshop hymnal of the XIX century, which contained a religious hymns. This book became the impetus for the creations by the composer â he wrote new songs based on the theme of faith in Lord. When Adam showed two cycles of works to Tina Landau, she proposed to combine them into a coherent whole thing. So a spectacular was built-up, which has been created on the songs written based on Greek myths and biblical themes. He was named âSaturn Returnsâ. Name of the product is directly related to the age of the author. Planet Saturn revolves around the sun once in 29 years. Approaching the 30-year milestone, Adam was trying to figure out whether he was able at that time to create something significant in his life or not., , During the re-working, Lucas moved away from the interpretation of musical, as the search for faith in God with the help of songs. She began to consider it as life of the religious family. Parents and children are shown by director impersonally. Elizabeth paid great attention to the compositions, but now the story line clearly runs throughout all work. The complex relationship arising between a father and a faithless child have become the main theme of the production. Production received another name. , , The musical features a sophisticated lighting and color design of the scene developed by H. Goldman. Original costumes by E. M. DeAngelis, helped each participant to realize in the performance as accurately as possible the image of own hero. Unusual choreography by W. Seyb allows the actors to express feeling through movements. Special attention deserves the orchestral group composed of pianist K. Stanislavskaya, violinist A. Waddell, bassist A. Terry, drummer J. Mack, guitarist J. Russ & cellist A. Seidner. Thanks to the masterful performance of the musical, it completely immerses the viewer into the world of images & fantasies of Adam Guettel."
"281","Naked Boys Singing ","    The musical has no plot and this is a revue. Musical numbers performed by men who are completely naked for almost the entire production. Actors perform on stage under their real names. Initially, the project was a radical gay show, which tried to draw attention to the problems of sexual minorities. Broadwayâs play lost the most tragic song about the early death of a homosexual partner. This revue has faded due to this and was offered to visit not only by gay men, but also women. Organizers assured that this is an excellent choice for a bachelorette party. In addition to the nude male bodies, visitors guaranteed the sea of merriment. Tickets in Kirk Theatre cost almost $ 70. Promotions coupons existed, which allowed to reduce this amount by 40%. In the room was forbidden to take photos or videos. Violators were expelled from the premises by guards. , , Viewersâ opinions, who saw the revue, were different. One people really enjoyed the show. Other visitors were disappointed by the fact that the actual duration of the performance was a third less than the claimed one in advertising. The show lasted not more than an hour instead of the promised 90 minutes. Stage design of the musical was minimal. Several compositions used a fog machine for special effects. It was noted that the only dressed person on the stage was pianist who accompanied the actors involved in the revue. In 2007, after this theatrical, a film of the same name was made. Directors of the motion picture were creators of the musical R. Schrock & T. Christian. In the film took part the actor fro in the original production â V. Zamora. It also included: J. Souza, K. A. Stea, P. Truong, J. Keane, J. Currie, A. Manough, J. Hodges, A. B. Ames, S. Vassallo."
"282","Narnia ","    At the core of this performance is famous work about the journey of four children in a magical country named Narnia. History reveals that siblingsâ passage to the wonderful world can be hidden in any place, even in such an unexpected like a wardrobe of the old house (which is the allegory stating that the true way to the Faith can be found in very unexpected places). Escaping from the war, children were trapped in a fairy tale, but it was not perfect at all. The evil Witch took advantage of the long absence of a legitimate ruler Aslan and captivated the governing of the country. She turned all haters into statues. Because of witchcraft of her, eternal winter settled in Narnia. But there was hope for the liberation of the inhabitants of the magical kingdom. According to the prophecy, one day two men and two women shall come, who are destined to not only overcome the evil witch, but also to become the future rulers of Narnia., , When the prophecy began to realize, Witch has done everything to capture and kill the dangerous guests. She managed to bewitch Edmund, using negative aspects of his personality (by means of this scene the struggle between our dark side of the soul and our wish to reach the light, as Bible understands it, is depicted). But it did not help the Witch to get to the other children. The nobility, honesty and friendship â bright sides â were their constant companions, which allowed to resist her. Despite the treachery of their sibling, they did everything to save him. Help came from Aslan, who returned to govern in his country. Lion was filled with love and patience, so he was able to forgive Edmund, when he was released from the captivity of the evil queen., , After having a conversation with the true ruler of Narnia, the boy changed â Aslan words settled in his soul. When a lion went for death instead of a child (here the sacrifice of godâs son Christ for the sins of humanity is clearly visible), Edmund completely rejected the negative aspects of his character. In fairyland, there was magic, which prevented the loss of innocent creature. Having overcome death, and then the evil queen, Aslan showed everyone who the true ruler of the land was. The main part of critics says that this image of Aslan â it was a Christian Lord and the Witch was the Devil. A struggle between them and forgiveness of Aslan for this child, who temporarily lost his way, reveals the nature of such a pure thing as forgiveness in Christianity., , Thanks to the efforts of the authors of the musical, magical Narnia can be seen in reality (and for several years â in cinemas. Films about this story collected huge box offices). Amazing music helps to plunge into the fantasy world populated by talking animals, representing fairly understood sides of human essence â someone helps and someone reveals only hatred. Taking a trip to Narnia is possible without a quest into the wardrobe â this play places us in this tremendous tale."
"283","Natasha, Pierre","    Dave Malloy has created a very unusual product. Taking the world-famous novel as the core, he was able to bring to his musical variety of music genres. Classic ballads were particularly good for expressing emotions of main characters in this play. Brittani Ashfordâs lyric helps the audience to feel emotional reflections of Sonya, when she decided to protect her cousin from extravagant ideas of a womanizer. She understood better the consequences of such irrational actions of Natasha than she did herself. Natalia could only dishonor her own name and familyâs one, having fled with supposedly loving her man, who was married. Terminating this engagement, she refused from her Count, who felt for her sincere and deep feelings. Youth and inexperience deceived Natalia. The girl was able to avoid a dangerous situation only with the help of caring people. She realized that true love should not be traded for a passing crush. A Count had not forgiven a girl who treated with his feelings so not thoughtfully. And even excuse of Pierre failed to soften the heart of the offended fiancÃ©e. He did not make allowances for the lack of experience of his beloved. Pierre is the most helpful and friendly character of the play. Once in the shackles of an unwanted marriage, the man did everything to get married with love. Pierre sincerely wished happiness for a girl. Natalia's eyes should shine with joy â to the joy of this man. As a true friend of the girl, Pierre was ready at any moment to come to her aid. The young lady was able to withstand the ordeal only thanks to the support. , , Director has created a very unusual action. He attracted the audience to participate in an organized performance. Being in close proximity, the audience could see all the emotions of the main characters. People got together by means of spiritual and real food â it served both classic and Russian cuisine in the restaurant where the action took place. Such a stage production relished critics in literal and figurative senses. Mixing the comedy moments, romance, serious love test and fever turned out very rough â just in the Russian style, exactly how many people in the West imagine it. The unusual staging of the classic work allows the viewer of any age to find something interesting and to get acquainted with Russian customs. This histrionics is watched at one go, which is the best indicator for any production."

Jack inspired them to take this step, who also could not reconcile with the demands of the capitalist.

He influenced the publisher, and so he had to make concessions to the distributors. , , The desire of people to fight for their rights was especially evident in the late XIX century. In those years, all over the world organized many political movements. Therefore, the violent reaction of young distributors is consistent with the spirit of the time. Bereft of home and family adolescents are particularly sensitive to the impairment of their already low financial capacity. For them, it was not simply lost in profits â they may be deprived of possibility to buy enough food to survive for another day. Journalist Katherine understood their extremely difficult situation. Despite the fact that she was from a wealthy family, she realized how hard life young newspapermen led. Own admiration for their desire to seek justice journalist expressed in her article.

"290","No Strings ","    The romantic story about the relationship of a black mannequin and white writer was created at a time when there was the struggle for the rights of colored people of America. The author of musical evaluated the abilities of the singer Diahann Carroll (she is still alive & 80 y.o.) before writing the script of the play. She has become his muse. The plot did not depend on the color of the skin of the protagonist. The basic idea of the musical was that true love is ready for any sacrifice for the sake of happiness of a beloved one. A girl let go of the writer, knowing that he can create only being home. Fashion model was also aware that the American society is not yet ready to see the relationship between people with different skin colors. The main character has decided to stay in a European country, where she was treated as an equal., , Despite the undeniable talent, leading actress also had to deal with the restrictions associated with her skin color. Thanks to musical, Diahann Carroll gained well-deserved popularity â singerâs talent was appreciated by both critics and the public. Leading actors asked to change the ending of the show â they wanted the mannequin and writer went to America together. But the authors of the piece were not ready to fight the public opinion. They knew that the audience could in this case not accept a musical. The love story of black woman and white man will be percepted normally only if it will take place in a European country. Europe was considered as the region where people were more tolerant and progressive at that time. Transferring the plot on the American continent meant to invade yet restricted area of race relations. The creators were not ready for such, so the lovers parted at the end of the play. , , This musical was the first work that Richard Rodgers wrote after the death of his permanent creative partner Oscar Hammerstein II. A romantic story was highly appreciated by the audience. Leading actors organically looked in the roles of a loving couple. Their voices blended perfectly, harmoniously fitting into the characters. Despite the passed years, the musical is still interesting for the beholder."
"291","Notre Dame de Paris ","    The reaction of the critics in the UK was duplicitous. On the one hand, music and choreography caused admiration, but the overall thrust of the show in an English translation were met with contempt. The Times praised the energy of the funeral of Quasimodo and rare creative staging touches. The Daily Mail called it as the usual musical concerto with dancing, light effects and a variety of French singers, who altogether reflected the universal sadness and disappointment. Producer of London show Michael White countered that modern critics experience hard times, because they have to equally understand well in Shakespeare, and in Harold Pinter, to evaluate any new musical work. Despite not very favorable reviews, the musical was the most successful set in the West End in 2000., , The reaction of the English-speaking audience attending the musical was mostly negative. Some expressed that the spectacular horrifies with number of records, number of plays, popular songsâ¦ Horrifying was even the fact that according to the program, all involved in the musical are famous actors of unprecedented talent, every word of whom uttered from the stage will live on forever. âThere is no place for ambiguity, all of the pieces plunges in shockâ â one of the audience shares his impression., , History of Victor Hugo is widely known throughout the world. Perhaps it is this fact lured the author of the musical performance Luc Plamondon. The compositions seemingly have to perform a single role, combining to reinforce the narrative line. But in reality everything is not so: each song is a separate image, not echoing with others. Regarding the show, there are also some questions. Esmeralda flutters like a butterfly from the prison to the lair of the toller of the cathedral without any explanations. The music part is really the weakest point, and it sinks the whole staging to the bottom. Each song is not in any way connected with the scenes, to which it would seem to belong. , , As for English variant of Will Jennings, it would be better if they were thrown all away into a swamp, as someone presumes. Some of music pieces are particularly irritating. In fact, there is too much of the music part, despite the fact that this is the essence of the histrionics. The scene with hanging of extras by the legs in the bell caused the frank laughter of the audience. And the climax with soaring to heaven of several corpses of women left very vague impressions. In general, it was evident that the team was working on the English-speaking musical, but after the presentation, someone unlikely will be singing any party from it. As for the French original, it may be considered the most fantastically tremendous and luring thing ever could be imagined. It is also known with other names, like Hunchback of Notre Dame."
"292","Of Thee I Sing ","    The musical was created during the Great American Depression. The authors decided to write a satirical piece that would show the political realities of the time. The history of a presidential candidate has been featured in a very unexpected way. Trying to find the most effective idea to attract the electorate, politicians have come to the opinion of needs of the ordinary person. Having found out that in addition to the money, maid as the finest representative of the strata, needed love, the men decided to base the whole campaign on this topic. To attract the attention of public, politicians conducted a beauty contest. The promise of a presidential candidate to marry the winner guaranteed interest of citizens in Wintergreen. But at the last moment everything went not according to the plan. The man realized that it is wrong to marry the one whom you saw for the first time in the life. Finding love not among the contest participants, he suggested the young woman to marry him. Especially because the main advantage of Mary was her corn muffins, wonderful taste of which was even recognized by the Supreme Court. Winnerâs deceiving about her fate seemed insignificant against the backdrop of such culinary perfection. , , Due to its subject, Wintergreen won an expedient victory in the elections. He was not destined conducting normal life of the president. When deceived girl took the fact of deception to the French ambassador, she also lied to him that she was a relative of Napoleon. Claiming the unborn child, the foreigner is explained it by the fact that in place of the first lady right now would have to be person having kinship with Napoleon. Therefore, his country had a right to this baby. Because of this, war almost started, but the president found a way â he decided to resign and transfer his duties to Vice President. Also the latter would have to marry to the winner of the beauty contest. But this did not bother him. Thus, Wintergreen family was saved., , Satire on political power is always dangerous, no matter in what way it was created. The authors of the musical did not know how rather conservative audience would react to their creation. But they decided to take a chance and put their work on the stage. Receiving Pulitzer Prize, musical showed that the majority of the American public appreciated this performance highly. Critics have pointed out that, despite the plot lightheadedness, composer created a beautiful piece. George Gershwinâs tunes were on top. Performance continues to interest many fans, as refined representative of satire. Staging allows the viewer to once again enjoy the craftsmanship of the famous composer."
"293","Oh Captain ","    The musical is based on the story of the captain of the film âThe Captain's Paradiseâ. The creators of the performances only changed the scenery â now the main character was not crossing the Strait of Gibraltar but Le Mans. Double life gave the man the ability to receive all the pleasure at once â from attention of a modest wife, creating comfort and warmth of the family, and ending with unrestrained joy in the company of his mistress in Paris. Possession of own ship allowed captain to believe that his fate was the most successful. But nothing is eternal in this life â soon heavenly pleasure of Henry ended. The Fate decided to intervene in the life of the protagonist. His wife tried to surprise the beloved husband, but in the end, she made a very unpleasant discovery for her own. Realizing that the captain lied to her for a long time, she decided to abandon him. But love is difficult to drive out of beloved heart, so she forgave her inconstant husband. , , The captain should understand that such conduct offends two women. But the thirst for pleasure did not give him to understand this. Lightheadedness of the sailor was based on the fact that his wife and the mistress never meet. But after this happened, the man was unable to withstand the fury of the deceived persons and fled to own ship. Thanks to assistant, captain was able to realize his bad behavior. He underestimated his wife. She was not meek and also wanted to have fun. But due to the fact that her husband was enjoying with his mistress, her appeals to him to have fun have been always rejected. If the captain has given more time to his wife, he would have realized that in a modest Englishwoman lies ardent passion and inexhaustible energy. , , The appearance of the musical on Broadway was appreciated by the public and critics. They noted that the production is filled with fun, mood, dancing and charming numbers. Artist ideally suited for the lead role â the image of a family man who loves fun, has easy surrendered to Tony Randall. His charisma complemented the story of trickster-captain, allowing the public to understand why women were crazy about Henry. Trying to replace this artist did not lead to success, and the musical was removed from the display. That is why this histrionics was so rare in appearance in theaters â it was very difficult to find the perfect match for the lead role. In 2003, Steve Rhyne managed to get used to the image of the captain. His vocal is perfect for this character. Critics have reacted favorably to the new production, created in the twenty-first century. Easy and melodic, musical enables the public to get a lot of pleasure from the contemplation of the adventures of love-filled Captain."
"294","Oh, Kay! ","    The musical is based on a play by Maurice Hanniquin & Pierre Veber â âLa Presidenteâ.

According to some critics, it was not the best production, created with the support of David Merrick, but it has won many accolades and awards (or nominations).

After some time a partner of the composer was forced to cease working with Rogers. He turned to Hammerstein with a proposal to cooperate on the creation of a new musical. Earlier, the librettist wanted to write histrionics based on the play, but the composer, with whom he had worked at that moment, was not interested in this piece. Therefore, a man gladly responded to the invitation of Rodgers. , , For this production, the script was written first, and then written songs. This approach was first used in creation of the musical.

"296","Oliver ","    The musical is based on the famous novel by C. Dickens. Creator had softened the situation prevailing in this production. According to critics, an important role was played by great songs by Lionel Bart. The novel by the English writer has often been called anti-Semitic, as the old thief Fagin was a Jew. In the show, he was depicted more as comic character than violent criminal. Because L. Bart himself was a Jew, he was able to avoid serious charges of anti-Semitism. Also in the play, the actors of this nationality were involved. When Lionel Bart experienced serious financial difficulties, he sold for 350 pounds all his rights to this spectacular and future versions of the play. Later M.

Despite the excellent vocals of J. Mueller, D. Turner & H. Connick, performing the role of Melinda, David & Dr. Mark Bruckner accordingly, they did not do a perfect trio. Stage design in the style of the 60s critics considered too clichÃ©d â at that time there was a lot of productions with the same design.

Porter began working on the production in 1949, immediately after the success of his previous show. Despite failing health, undermined in 1937 due to the equestrian trauma, and severe illness of his wife, the author puts all his energy into making this job. Initially, as the director was invited A. deMille. But then a woman has been replaced by G. Abbott, even without informing her in advance. When C. Porter tried to charge A. DeMille in choreography of the performance, she refused, because did not wish to work with such an unreliable person., , During the off-Broadway show in Boston, some scenes were censored due to excessive vulgarity. The exhibition of African-American dancer Janet Collins in bikini shocked many viewers. Director G. Abbott was unable to improve the production significantly. He made a major mistake by removing from the musical the only song that could bring the show great fame. After âFrom This Moment Onâ was included in the adaptation of a previous play of C.

According to them, the show seemed redundant and obsolete-masqueraded, recalling the productions of the 1920s. Dance reviewers, on the contrary, were very positive about the performance, assessing quality, fantastic choreography and daring of the performance. Movements of C. Greenwood, who played Juno, in the opinion of critics, admired everyone by their uniqueness and some grotesque. Musical love theme was quite daring for that time.

Part of the productâs name was taken from the text of the genuine letters of Commodore Matthew C. Perry, sent to the Japanese emperor. The second half indicates the region where the playâs events occur. Staging is considered the most ambitious and complex of all musicals by Stephen Sondheim. The original Broadway show was created in the style of Japanese theaters, where all the roles are played by men. Reviews on this musical from critics were mixed. Director Harold Prince used many methods of Kabuki theater, when creating productions. All sceneshifters wore black clothes and their faces were covered with dark masks. According to some critics, the directorâs attempts to gather in the performance Japanese traditions and Western style are similar to bonsai tree. The show turned out just the same unusual, beautiful and perfectly formed. , , From the next versions of the musical, Japanese performance has attracted the most attention of the public. Director Amon Miyamoto showed the play to Tokyo audience and after 2 years â to Americans. A few years later, he created a new Broadway version of the play. Unlike the American version, this production was considered not too successful. Despite the positive feedback in relation to the director, the play itself has not made the proper impression on critics. According to the reviewers, when transferring the musical, it had lost something important. No similar scenery and costumes, no initial staging concept could not help the performance to be compared with the version of the show, which a few years ago saw the American audience. , , The original musical of 1975 was nominated for Drama Desk (7 nominations, 2 wins) and Tony (10 nominations, 2 wins). Also, it received 1 reward from New York Drama Critics' Circle. Updated Broadway production in 2004 was nominated for: Drama League (1 nomination), Outer Critics Circle (2 nominations), Tony (4 nominations). In the last week of the show, this version of the production â as of January 2005 â in box office amounted to 325,514 dollars per 1 week."
"304","Paint Your Wagon ","    The musical has not become a popular representative of own genre â A. J. Lerner & F. Loewe could not repeat the success that accompanied their earlier work, set on Broadway in 1947. Despite the fact that the theme of the Gold Rush was quite interesting for the audience, the plot, according to critics, was the weak point of this work. Choreography by A. de Mille many reviewers have noted as a very decent and glamorous. Subsequently, based on dances, set for this musical, ballet âGold Rushâ was created. The performance was sufficiently favorable perceived by the audience â in 1951, it became the loudest novelty of the season. But in the future, this musical was no longer appearing on Broadway. When in 1969 was carried out an adaptation for TV, its plot has undergone quite significant changes. Actors that have been involved in the film (Clint Eastwood, L. Marvin, J. Seberg and others), performed all of their songs themselves. But the film received mostly negative critical reviews. , , The variant of 2004, which was based on an adapted version of the script, made a good impression on reviewers. In this work were the same characters, but the story line has been completely redone. Lighting and scenery by Daniel Ionazzi immersed the audience into the world of the miners of the XIX century. The special effect produced authentic pictures of miners, which were shown in the background of the scene. The original version of the play entered the Encores! 2015 â within the framework of this program were shown old performances, which rarely appear on the stage. Screenplay was adapted by M. Acito. Critics praised the vocal and choreographic performance of the actors involved in the formulation, very high. K. Carradine very organically looked in the role of Ben. In the musical participated also J. Guarini. This young man came in second place in the project named âAmerican Idolâ."
"305","Pajama Game","    At the heart of the musical is the novel â7Â½ Centsâ, written by R. Bissell. A major role in creating this work played by a composer & lyricist F. Loesser â he composed two songs for the musical. Thanks to his support, young authors J. Ross & R. Adler were able to write other songs for this play. It was the second collaboration of young composers. It brought them fame and popularity. After the third and also very successful work, the duo broke up â Jerry Ross died at the age of 29 years. Young choreographer Bob Fosse was invited to create the musical numbers thanks to the patronage of his wife, the actress. At the insistence of managers, director George Abbott turned to J. Robbins â in this way they wanted to reduce the risk of inviting the inexperienced director. Choreographer agreed to be the understudy to Fosse, but he demanded for himself the post of co-director and a bigger fee. The only merit of Robbins may be considered that he was able to convince George Abbott not to cut from the performance interesting number invented by B. Fosse. , , The Broadway production in 1954 as a dancer involved then-little-known actress S. MacLaine. She was also the understudy of C. Haney, who played the role of Gladys. When the leading actress injured her ankle, her place was taken by MacLaine. Dancer played Gladys for a few months. In her memoirs, Shirley noted that she came on the scene, never rehearsing her role. Due to the excitement, she dropped her hat, which according to the number, she supposed to throw over her head. Expressing own strong feelings with loud phrase âOh, sh**!â, MacLaine greatly shocked the audience. But after the completion of performance, the audience gave standing ovations to the actors. Instantly becoming a famous, actress has signed a 5-year contract with H. B. Wallis, who represented the company Paramount Pictures. In 1957, the production was filmed by Warner Bros. , , In 2013, at the Theatre Festival in Chichester has been shown the next version of the musical. During the transfer of production in the West End, producers decided to draw financing from the ordinary people. But it was not just a simple charity. Now every person, invested in the production of the musical, became a full-fledged investor. Once the staging pays off, people should begin to receive their share of the profits. Using such an approach, producers could attract 200 thousand pounds from 218 investors, which accounted for 14% of the total cost. The money was collected for 2 months. This is the first musical, which used a similar method of financing to obtain funds for the establishment of production. Critics have praised the musical highly, noting its ease and romanticism, despite the presence of political scenes."
"306","Pal Joey ","    Writer John O'Hara suggested composer R. Rodgers & poet L. Hart his stories about Pal Joey for creation of a new musical. The main character has been featured as immoral, albeit a charming young man. This story is fundamentally different from the usual classic musical comedies, which were popular at the period between Great Depression and WWII. The creators decided that an actor, who played the main role, should be very cute, despite the negative image of his character. After the premiere on Broadway, musical has received mostly negative critics. Despite this, it became pretty long-running show, one of longest at that time created by Rodgers & Hart for Broadway. , , Due to the negative reaction of the public and critics, the musical was not allowed to broadcast on the radio, even in the form of individual compositions. The official ban on broadcasting was withdrawn only at the end of the 1940s. One of songs of performance became a hit in 1950. Thanks to this piece, has been produced a recording of this histrionics.

In 2003, the spectacular has received Barrymore Award. , , According to critics, the musical was ahead of its time. History, shown in 1940, found no positive response from the public. After 12 years, the same performance was very well received by critics and audiences. Initially, the antihero hadnât cause delight of puritanical society. Besides, negative impact of the Great Depression still continued in the US and many people in USA experienced it still. But after World War II, the audience had a different look at the anti-hero of this production. Now they were not so strict to various actions that made characters. The audience also appreciated the ambiguity of Joey, drawing attention to his weakness and daydreaming. This was mostly thanks to charisma of Harold Lang, playing the role of a young rake."
"307","Parade ","    The basis of plot of the musical is a real tragedy, which took place in Atlanta in the early XX century, with 13-year-old girl and falsely accused factory manager.

Then production was shot without an audience. It has made possible to use special equipment to capture close-ups. Critics praised the created film. Many have noted the work of a director as perfectly conveying the atmosphere of Broadway. They drew attention to the fact that the record has turned out lively & convincing. According to the reviewers, Spike Lee made the right choice having carried out this specific way of an adaptation."
"309","Passion ","    The musical is an adaptation of the film âPassione d'Amoreâ, shot by director E. Scola in 1981. The picture is based on the novel âFoscaâ, written by I. U. Tarchetti. S. Sondheim saw the Italian film in 1983. In the course of viewing, the composer realized that the picture can be musical â songs have already begun to take shape in his mind. He immediately decided that the libretto for the work should write J. Lapine â writer greatly felt different epochs and perfectly transferred their romantic atmosphere onto the scene. Critics were delighted with the staging. But some viewers didnât have serious attitude to this work. During a performance, in a hall resounded laughter, which was very upsetting for the cast and creators.

Its development was performed in 1999 by ASCAP Foundation / Disney Musical Theatre Workshop. The first staged reading of the theatrical took place during the Berkshire Theatre Festival, which took place in Massachusetts. After receiving good reviews about the play, the authors decided to carry out its production in California. In the future, the musical has been re-worked. Creators also changed the name of the play. Californian version caused various reactions from critics. Noticing some absurdity of the plot, they focused their attention on the ease of musical numbers of the show. Many reviewers noted that the histrionicsâ songs seemed very fun and beautiful. Music was not spoiled even by the lack of deep meaning in the lyrics. Some critics did not like such a frivolous attitude of the creators to their work. Other reviewers, on the other hand, were happy to visit the show, where they could have a good laugh. Though most of the audience appreciated this unusual piece., , The staging was made using different styles of music â jazz, blues, country, folk, gospel, rock etc. J. Wann decided to use satire to show viewers customs of the inhabitants of small American towns. But the composer wasnât rudely making fun of the shortcomings of the native society. Soft irony did not allow anyone to feel insulted. Because of involvement of not more than 7 actors on the production, a small company can cope with it, even members of school groups and professional theater artists. As planned by J. Wann, all roles can be performed by artists who were involved in the production of the play. The composer called this style âguitar theatreâ. Previously, J. Wann has created such musical on a similar basis. It had great success with audiences and critics. "
"311","Peter Pan ","    At the heart of a musical is adaptation of the play âPeter Panâ, created by J. M. Barrie in 1904. The script also took into account the novel âPeter and Wendyâ, which was written by the writer in 1911.

NBC Channel funded the musical, and its creators intended to show the play live on television. The color broadcast of production was watched by about 65 millions of Americans. But till our time have survived only black-and-white records of this creation. Almost always the role of Peter was played by women. The only exception was a one-time replacement of the actress C. d'Amboise by her understudy â J. Noseworthy. Olympic gymnast Cathy Rigby played a boy who did not want to grow up, for 22 years. It first appeared on stage in a production of 1990. Film version of the play with recently deceased Robin Williams was another exception and the next film of 2015 with famous Hue Jackman named âHookâ was yet another exception. , , This musical is one of the most loved shows in the USA. A thrilling story of the lost boys and their adventures in a fantastic country experiences great popularity among the audience. The first staging received good reviews from critics. Subsequent versions of the musical have also made a positive impression on the audience and reviewers. Many of them said that the choreography of Patti Colombo is different with special vividness and originality. Due to changes in policy towards the indigenous peoples of America in modern times, the musical is an object to change. Song of the Indians, which was present in the original production, insulted the people of this race; therefore, it is changed on the new version. , , Broadway production of 1954 was three times awarded with Tony.

"312","Phantom of the Opera","    The idea to create a musical based on the eponymous French novel by the Frenchman Gaston Leroux, came to A. L. Webber in 1984 was due to the producer C. Mackintosh, when he told him about his plans. After reviewing two film adaptations of the novel, they were thinking about how to implement a similar story on the stage. Soon, A. Lloyd Webber purchased a used copy of very rare edition of the work of the French writer. This book throughout the creation of the musical inspired the composer. To write the lyrics were invited A. J. Lerner, R. Stilgoe & C. Hart. In the production used lyrics of the last two authors. , , Because the action took place in the theater, A. Lloyd Webber was able to embody in his work the principle of ""the show within the show"". Despite the strict musical form and structure, the score reflected in times operatic style. Decorations were created by M. BjÃ¶rnson. The designer came up with 200 different costumes for performance. Set design included very unusual items: a huge chandelier, a gondola, where Phantom and Christine crossed the underground lake, and a large staircase. Also, the designer has created a half-mask for the main character. In 1985, during the try-outs, Phantom's face was completely covered with the mask, which prevented actor to act well. Half-mask has become the hallmark of this production. Job of M. BjÃ¶rnson has been awarded with a number of prizes., , Setting aroused great excitement of the public, though critics were divided in their opinion. In their reviews, they noticed that the storyline was too simple for this musical. But thanks to the perfect balance of all the parts, it was almost unnoticeable when viewing a show. Has been noted excellent performance of M. Crawford, who played the role of a mysterious mentor of young singer. That part made him extremely famous and rich. According to critics, the image of Phantom completely overshadowed the rest of the heroes. A deep and expressive voice of M. Crawford perfectly fit his character and a song âThe Music Of The Nightâ has become the hallmark of the play and one of best songs ever made in the world. Soprano of S. Brightman sounded amazingly. Due to her fragile appearance in youth, the singer perfectly embodied young Christine, who eventually broken a heart of the Phantom. , , Despite the opinion of critics, the musical has become the most popular thing ever made in musical theater. Show was staged in different countries around the world, proving that great music of Webber is perceived by the public regardless of nationality. The performance lives for almost 30 years on Broadway and in the West End. The musical was twice marked by Laurence Olivier Award. Broadway production received 7 Drama Desks and another 11 nominations. It was also awarded 5 times with Outer Critics Circle Award. The musical won 7 Tonies and had another 3 nominations. In 2010, Webber presented to the public a continuation of the musical, but the sequel was unable to repeat the dizzying success that accompanied the first production."
"313","Pipe Dream ","    At the heart of the musical is a small novel âSweet Thursdayâ, written by J. Steinbeck as a continuation of âCannery Rowâ. Producers C. Feuer & E. Martin turned their attention to one of the characters of the first work and decided that the story of his participation can be converted into an interesting musical. When they turned to the proposal to the writer, J. Steinbeck wrote a sequel. Having been refused by F. Loesser, to which producers have addressed previously, C. Feuer & E. Martin asked to focus on creation of piece O. Hammerstein with R. Rodgers. Partners began to doubt in their abilities â before they have composed only family shows. Yet the authors did an adaptation of J. Steinbeckâs work. They decided not to indicate that Suzy was a prostitute â in a musical, girl turned into a little tramp. Subsequently, the writer showed dissatisfaction with such a change, although acknowledged that the creators have had the right to do so. , , For pre-sales of the Broadway show, about 1.2 million dollars were gained. After the premiere, the audienceâs interest has dropped dramatically. Musical on Broadway lasted less than a year. The staging failed to avoid failure, despite the changes made  in the course of the season. After the closure of the show, for 1 year died two leading artist of this production â W. Johnson & J. Tyler. H. Traubel said that this musical was cursed. Criticism of the Broadway production was mainly neutral and negative. Due to the failure, the producers have decided to abandon the national tour and transferred the production in London. Further performances were extremely rare. The musical was never filmed, though such plans existed. Lovers should be played by actors, and other characters â by heroes of puppets of Muppets show., , S. Regan, director of a London staging, decided to emphasize the true essence of place named Bear Flag CafÃ©. The suits of girls showed that they worked in a brothel. According to many critics, it is the silence by the musical creators about this fact dramatically reduced the tension of love story between a biologist and a little tramp. Very often, the audience did not understand the hesitation of man during establishing relations with Suzy â they did not realize that the girl was working in such a place. Modern productions have shown the viability of this piece, despite the fact that this work is considered as of today the most unfortunate work of Hammerstein & Rodgers."
"314","Pippin ","    In 1970ies, a new star appeared in the theater world â his long way began composer & lyricist S. Schwartz. He tasted the glory from staging his first brainchild, and for the next was already looking for a producer â the play about the son of Charlemagne., , This musical has become a real boon for people who were tired of the monotonous music and similar dancing. The histrionics felt fresh, and the actors did anything to surprise the beholders, making them watch it with the mouth open from delight. , , A special salt of this show was in the wandering troupe of actors led by Narrator, who spoken directly to the viewer, submitting the story of the son of the king in the spirit of commedia dell'arte. When Mr. Fosse connected to this work â one of the best directors-choreographers â in the musical added his main attractions â the irony and erotica. That explains the presence of the rather long scene where Pippin plunges in sensual pleasures with a lot of women trying to find his life purpose. Isnât it weird â to try to find own way, diving headlong into the communication, leading to nowhere? Interestingly that originally old Narrator in the musical has become active and young. And now his role has consisted of not only to comment on the events, but also to tempt the protagonist, like Mephistopheles. , , This story is about finding own way of life, about attempts, ups and downs. It would seem that the main actor have had all the qualities to achieve the desired goal: youth, beauty (incidentally, the real historical figure of Prince Pippin was endowed with a physical disability â a hump on his back), and aspirations. However, he was too keen on searching for some higher purpose, fame and recognition. But the journey, in which he was to find himself, shows that many things didnât fit him. Tests with vanity, lust and power, fully in the spirit of medieval morality plays, allowed the hero to realize that true happiness is not money, power or recognition. True happiness was for him a simple life, devoid of frills, full of ordinary pleasures. Everyone should find his path and one variant of this kind of search was exhibited to beholders in this play."
"315","Pirate Queen","    The musical âThe Pirate Queenâ is based on the novel by M. Livelin named âGrania â the King of the Irish Seasâ. The theme of women's emancipation is always interesting, and in the old days, it was particularly acute. It is just right to recall that only in the early twentieth century, in England was a struggle for women's rights to participate in elections and suffrage movement had achieved its results: in 1918, in many countries, particularly in the UK and Ireland, women were given the right to elect people's representatives. , , How could be not interesting the fate of the female pirate, a female leader, the one who put the well-being of her people above personal happiness?! Judging by the whisper of the audience in the hall before the premiere, they expected to see something special, because in fact â it was a drama of love between a man and a woman, a drama of love for own country, above life. And all this with the salty taste of the seaâ¦ , , From the first minutes, it became clear that the team that was engaged in work on the musical, worked really hard to display on the stage hard work of seafarers of those times. Tug-of-war, raising the sails, fighting with swords, stimulating and plunging into the atmosphere of Ireland's 16th century music. , , This musical â at that moment was the last joint work of A. Boublil and C.-M. SchÃ¶nberg, who did everything to make the story as realistic as possible, to give the viewer to feel the pain of the protagonist. Modern women are mostly not forced to marry at the instructions of parents to secure the businesses of the two families (well, if only they donât belong to the secular society / very rich people). The main character had to sacrifice personal happiness for the sake of the homeland. It did not break her, only made stronger. , , Many beholders expressed opinion that the musical was very similar to ""Les Miserables"", plus two performances were based on the same historical epic formula. But The Pirate Queen was far brighter and louder, and constantly stirred Uilleann pipes and Celtic harp only saturated the plot, making it more luring and vivid. And adding a couple of words about absolutely unique and talented acting troupe, we must emphasize the tremendous acting of the main actors. Their more than 2 and a half hours of mesmerizing play captivated the viewers. May this story be far from the current time, but the real historical characters always arouse public interest and their history â a lively response."
"316","Pirates of Penzance","    Every time when Gilbert & Sullivan were working together a common brainchild, it promised to be an incredible success with public. From the strongest tandem of poet W. S. Gilbert's & musician A. Sullivan, the heart halts., , Like all comic operas of two talented actors, The Pirates of Penzance is a grotesque, parodic and satirical work. It is completely impregnated with mockery of the various sides of ordinary English life. For example, when a squad of pirates shows unprecedented bravery in the battle with the police, they suddenly give up because the police demanded the surrender of the robbers in the name of Queen. It is difficult to imagine such pirates in the real life. Thus, Gilbert & Sullivan in a satirical manner showed features of Victorian patriotism. Humorous is also a moment when the police shouts in every voice about readiness to rush into battle, but in practice remain standing still. , , The creators also could not ignore the fact that in those days the military ranks were distributed to the right and left, to even those who were far from military affairs. That is why the image of major-general turned out so grotesque, when he was not in a single battle, never smelled gunpowder, but he was an expert in all subjects, not only in the art of warfare, but also in psychology and microbiology. , , It is impossible to be silent about the incredible parties of L. Ronstadt, A. Lansbury & K. Kline. Actors deliberately exaggerate the seemingly most minor word lines, and it looks amazing. A group of compassionate pirates experiencing weakness for orphans, because they are orphans themselves. It brings a smile to the lips. What kind of piracy success can we talk in such case? How do they survive at all, if everybody pretended orphans and were released immediately?! In general, the musical is well-done, and the fact that this play was staged in 2013 in New York and in 2015 â in Toronto with a resounding success â speaks for itself. Nice to feel when magic envelops you from the first minutes."
"317","Play On! ","    Musical is based on the works of Shakespeare â very popular in the world. For scriptwriters and directors, it is an honor to be able to make a musical based on the plays of imperishable William Shakespeare. To date, 11 works of the author have been staged all over the world (Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Midsummer Night's Dream and others). The play âTwelfth Nightâ, written in 1600-1601, experienced for 4 adaptation, from which Play On! differs with music material and time of events. American playwright C. L. West has shifted the action in Harlem of 1940ies. Musical inspirer and author of lyrics was D. Ellington. , , With Harlem is tied many resurgences of African-American music. Also, not far from the main theater for blacks of that time Apollo Theater, lived and created iconic person of that time, in particular Duke Ellington. , , Musical captivates from the first minutes with its numbers, causing a dip in the difficult times. Then the woman in the music world has been tabooed, as if women on the ship in ancient times were a bad omen, leading to misfortune. Because of this, we must pay tribute to the main character of the histrionics, as she did not retreat from her dream and aimed to realize herself as a musician and songwriter, disguised as a man. She also took a creative pseudonym., , Staging is full of music; it is literally saturated with it. And no wonder, because Harlem of 1930-1940-ies was filled with small taverns with talented pianists and bands playing jazz, swing and blues. Life here did not stop daily and nightly. Jazz celebrities gave concerts and the audience enthusiastically watched them. , , In the âPlay On!â musical is reflected the center of events famous club, where making for a living and doing favorite things, gathered dozens of dancers, singers and musicians. The life here was boiling literally: daily performances, the search of muse, sincere feelings, love vicissitudes, and at the head of the creative mix â the desire of young women to achieve her goals, despite the rigid attitude towards female authors. Her talent and irresistible perseverance eventually prevailed. Sitting in the hall, watching on the main character Vy, you feel empathy to her, and at the same time, notice that such an attitude to the difficulties would be nice to implement in own life. Life puts obstacles. But only in our hands to maintain firmness of spirit and keep moving forward come what may."
"318","Pocahontas ","    It is very romantic and memorable love story. This is love between two people who shouldn't have loved each other on developed stereotypes at all, and on contrary, to be at war among themselves and to hate. But it was attraction at the first sight., , Pocahontas is a symbol of the person who is capable to love and achieve her objective despite everything. She is capable to perceive world around and to see all beauty of the nature, to enjoy its paints. The world will become dead if the person perceives cruelly â such idea is revealed in the spectacular. It reminds viewers that the nature is not property of any person, that each plant and animal doesnât deserve what someone would solve for them whether they can live or should they die., , Music is picked up ideally. All animated films of the 90th years differ with not sample, qualitative music. This production didn't become an exception., , Animation in the musical is excellent until this day. Watching the picture the viewer derives pleasure from how perfectly it is drawn! An episode in which Pocahontas floats on the wild river singing composition 'Just Around the Riverbend' is one of the most sensual, beautiful and concerning in the animated film: the rapid current carries away the girl's boat down, water behind a board becomes white from foam, and huge noisy falls validly don't muffle her ringing singing, habitually meeting Pocahontas on a visit. , , The grandmother of the main character, whose spirit lives in the magic tree, has turned out tremendous! This is wise, kind and understanding old woman adoring talking to the granddaughter and helping her with sincere questions. 'Listen to your heart and you will understand!' â she says by little tired, old and infinitely tender voice. Each detail of this musical is penetrating, and the pleasure from viewing of a picture is really inexpressible."
"319","Pretty Faces ","    This production attracts the audience by its simplicity. It is an unusual thing, as only plus-size women are featured here. But all of them are remarkably pretty. The staging is witty and gutsy. , , The main part of every spectacle is the music, which is absolutely marvelous. Robert W. Cabell has created perfect compositions, which magnificently intertwine with the plot. The audience likes them from the first second. People usually say that they are short and exciting at the same time. Voices of gifted actors and singers make them even more amazing. The words in the songs are sometimes extremely funny. They make a viewer laugh. We cannot dislike the heroines. Despite the fact that they are plump, we are delighted with them. We observe their transportation throughout the production. The main character is just like Cinderella. She gets pretty step by step. All the women start looking attractive and sensual. They are not just fatties anymore. The viewer sees their other side and is enchanted by it., , The world of glamour is presented on the stage. This fact demanded costumes and decorations to be mesmerizing. And the designers managed to fulfill such task. Look, for instance, at the dress of the girl from the south. It is not extraordinary, but it reflects both her charm and the place, she has come from. , , The cast deserves our attention as well. The women are really talented actresses. They are able not only to act and to sing, but also to dance. The one, who was responsible for choreography, did a wonderful job. The movements are not too complicated, but they are nice and charming. Each of the girls in the production shows her best qualities and features. This musical received positive reviews. The audience absolutely loved it. Thatâs why it deserved a revival in 2005 in New York. A bit earlier, in 2004, the show also won a reward at Musical Theatre Festival, which proves its popularity and success. The staging is full of energy. We can even feel it while watching. Probably only those, who prefer to see typical characters, will not like it. All the rest should give it a chance by all means. Beautiful dances, gifted and cute actresses, creative and funny songs, pretty costumes â all these things make the musical worthwhile."
"320","Princess and the Frog ","    The musical is able to win our hearts by all means. First thing is that it is a very famous story, known to everyone. But it is told in a different way. It makes it original and much more exciting. , , Another thing is the characters. There are lots of African American heroes, which is not that typical for animated movies. The most attractive is, of course, the revival of classical style of Disney studio. The designers have selected âLady and the Trampâ as an ideal representation of such style. The characters are fantastically beautiful, as they have always been in the past â in the times of âSleeping Beautyâ & âThe Little Mermaidâ. The directors, chosen for the production, are masters in such work, as they are those, who have created âAladdinâ and some other pieces of Disney art., , There are lots of celebrities, who has taken part in the show. You can even recognize their voices. Oprah Winfrey was not only the voice, but also a technical consultant, who helped to make the musical magnificent. The songs deserve our attention. Every Disney film contains them, but here, they are special. Randy Newman made his best, while composing them. The voices of the singers perfectly match with them as well. The actors managed to transfer all the emotions and feelings of their characters. The drawing is mesmerizing â every line is just where it should be., , The interpretation of a famous fairy-tale appeared to be extremely successful. The audience in North America and in the world immediately liked it from its release in 2009. This is a story for both children and adults, as every classical Disney movie is something worthwhile. If you are ready to become a little kid for half an hour, to believe in magic and eternal love once again â watch this Disneyâs musical. It will definitely make you laugh and cry at the same time and will leave unforgettable feelings."
"321","Priscilla Queen of the Desert ","    The staging has become fantastically successful worldwide starting from the first run in Australia. The critics were very positive about it from the very beginning. The characters of the staging might seem strange for the conservative viewer. But everyone, who has no prejudices, will adore them (like ones in the 1st part of Dumb and Dumber). They are not like us, but they want the same things as we do. They are looking for understanding and acceptance. The story is not just about gays and transgenders, but it is about love and friendship., , Of course, the plot is not the only thing that attracts the audience. There are lots of popular songs, added to the musical. People recognize them and enjoy. The performers sing fantastically, their voices fill our hearts with warmth and love towards them. Even though they are different, a viewer cannot dislike them. The show is diluted by creative dances. The choreographer should be praised for such beautiful movements and great job, he has done. The actors are also extremely gifted. They perform and sing wonderfully. It is also interesting to see men acting as females. They managed to do it just perfectly. Their acting is so real that we canât imagine them to be other people in reality. One more thing, which deserves our attention, is costumes. They are marvelous. There are lots of bright colors. The fabric is glittering. It helps to transfer special atmosphere of the show. The musical is worth the awards it has obtained for costume design. Disco style is predominant here â in both dances and visual decorations, such as hairstyles of the heroes. It allows to return to the past and to feel the culture and spirit of those times., , In this staging, the audience may found things, which will make them laugh and cry. There is a comedy here as well as a drama. But everything ends happily. The characters find for what they have longed for so long â they are finally accepted and understood by people around. The play is full of life and energy, which is felt by the audience., , This nice and touching story has an extremely beautiful form. Such form made many people around the globe adore it. It was a good idea to transform a movie into a musical, as the story got the second life this way. Plenty of people have watched the performance during the displays, and more of them would like to do it. So, you must give it a try and make certain that it will become one of your favorite spectacles. You will enjoy the talent of the performers, the dances, familiar music and unique atmosphere of the outstanding musical."
"322","Producers ","    The musical, which became an adaptation of the movie, gained even more success. Both West End and Broadway productions broke the box-office sales records. Not all the critics were impressed by the spectacle. Some of them said it was a bit old-fashioned. But everyone agrees that it is full of fun, which allows not to pay attention to the negative features. , , The staging is different from the film in some details. Lots of jokes are taken from it. But the key differences lie in the time of action â it is 1968 in the movie and 1959 in the musical, the sum of money, which has originally been one million and turns into two, the author of the play is portrayed more sympathetically and the beautiful secretary has more essential role. In general, the spectacle has become more positive compared to the movie version., , Mel Brooks, who is one of the creators of the musical and the author of the film, is a master of comedy. He is considered one of the most successful directors and composers, which is one of the reasons, why the show has appeared to be so popular. His works have received plenty of awards, including Oscar, Grammy and Emmy. This staging was not an exception, winning a record of 12 Tony Awards (out of 15 nominations). It has also got 10 Drama Desk Awards. It is an achievement of the director â Susan Stroman as well., , Broadway production managed to gather $3 million and later (during the limited run) $3.5 million in a single day. It was able to break its own record. It is worth watching not just because of funny and interesting plot and creative songs. The design of costumes is very accurate. It reflects the time of action and creates the necessary atmosphere. William Ivey Long made his best and won a Tony Award for the Broadway performance. His costumes might be found on display at Costume World Broadway Collection in Florida., , The work of actors is overwhelming. Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick are so amazing in their roles. They make the audience laugh. Being fraudsters according to the storyline, they are able to make people like them laugh anyway. It is also unusual and amusing to see, how they perform on the stage and sing being great film actors. Their voices turn to be fantastically beautiful. The show is so finely created that everyone should watch it. It is not only the collection of stars, but a very talented work of gifted people."
"323","Promises, Promises ","    The performance has exhibited out an internal moral conflict, which resulted in winning either of low-lying side of human nature, or the lofty principles. Love in the musical is shown from variety of sides. The feelings of the protagonist are as follows: unattainable love, lofty, clean, requiring for efforts and even victims. Love of the boss is quite different, it is to meet his needs and is not pushing to any steps, nor chasing any intended targets. Love from the perspective of men of insurance company is adventure, affair, no obligatory passion. Love of Fran is all that she lives for, giving herself to it completely. In this, she is very similar to Chuck, so not surprising that in the end, they find each other and stay together, because both can appreciate love as the greatest gift. , , The action takes place in the historical period when the morals gave a crack, and the society called it a âsexual revolutionâ. During the first staging of the play, it was extremely important to show that, despite the newfangled sexual emancipation, human needs remain the same. A person requires for a soul mate and a relationship of the highest kind. The name of the musical âPromises, promisesâ reflect hopes, which are not destined to be fulfilled, because people rarely appreciate and keep their word, seeking only to get what they want and not to please other person. Getting what they were striving for, they simply forget about their obligations. These âpromisesâ keep the audience in suspense for all two and a half hours until the denouement, which predictably is a celebration of love and justice. Counting for high entertainment, the audience will not be disappointed. The musical includes atmospheric songs and unexpected choreographic solutions."
"324","Pump Boys And Dinettes ","    This is a kind of lightweight show. Such performances are not usually very popular and have short lives. But this staging is different. The audience loved it from the first display. This is the reason, why the musical was showed on Broadway (being an off-Broadway spectacle for the first time) and got the second life in 2014. , , The production had positive reviews of the critics. Some of them called it a mixture of theatrical performance and a concert of country-rock music. And the latest is the thing, which is especially noticed by them. The music reflects the culture and spirit of the South. There are various styles mixed here, such as R&B;, Country, Gospel and Rockânâroll. There is hardly any kind of plot here. It is driven by the relations of the characters. Being a concert in the set, it was praised by both the critics and the audience. , , The lyrics are also outstanding â fascinating and contain satire and pleasant humor. But there are several songs, which are touching and heartfelt (such as the song of two waitresses). Both lyrics and music created by a gifted composer Jim Wann., , The actors deserve special attention. They act fantastically. They are famous and extremely talented. Many of them have obtained rewards in the past. Look, for instance, at the acting of Debra Monk. She did her best, being a winner of Emmy and Tony Awards. But the characters themselves are too thinly drawn. The emotions might have been more powerful. Despite this fact, the original show was successful. The performers managed to make country music appropriate and pleasant for the Broadway stage. They also appeared to be perfect dancers, singers and actors. , , One of the latest versions for the 2013-2014 season was directed by Mark Cuddy, famous for his works, such as The Music Man, Sweeney Todd, A Christmas Story and many others. It was made for the Geva Theatre Center. In this version, not only the actors, bus also the set is amazing. Everything is detailed in order to create necessary atmosphere. We should thank Vicki Smith, who has become a scenic designer, for that. , , The dances are another important part of the musical. The choreographer (it was Peggy Hickey for the latest production) did his best. The costumes by Devon Painter add to the general impression. They are not just beautiful, but reflect the fashion of the South. All the versions have the same basis. There were no updates. And those, who like old times with their warmth, will definitely love the staging."
"325","Quadrophenia  ","    It is absolutely British thing that openly shows the rebellious youth of the early '60s. England, it is 1964; the youth is divided into two main camps: ""Mods"" and ""Rockers"". Involuntarily pops joke by Paul McCartney, when he was asked:, -	Are you ""Mod"" or ""Rocker""?, -	I am ""Mocker""!, This musical is about the Mods. This musical is made by the Mods. It was made in 1979, just in time for mod-revival (formation of the second wave-motion of Modes). Who knows, maybe, this musical was one of the reasons? This musical is from The Who, one of the biggest Mod groups, which at one time just disorganized the movement. It is one of the best, if not the best at all, about the British youth, about young people who were tired of gray conformism and life of conservative England., , The musical is different from others, that this time it is not shown the love on the background of the movement, but on the contrary, the movement against the background of the love! In the relationship between Stephanie and Jimmy there is much less romance than in how Cooper is worried about his Lambretta or with what trepidation he gathers a collection of newspaper clippings., , This story is about the eternal problem of fathers and children, when adults do not understand the ideals of young people. Perhaps that is why this musical has been recognized by these adults as rude? It's about the guys who want to always look cool, who liked to have fun and go to parties seven days a week, which swallowed amphetamines and arranged the major fights in 1964, for example such as Brightonâs one. This musical is about life, beating as the fountain., , Clumsy silly Jimmy is the hero of our time. âQuadropheniaâ is another Bible for teenagers, and it is, like âThe Catcher in the Ryeâ or, say, âA Clockwork Orangeâ is the more valuable the earlier the reader is to be acquainted with it. However, even if the viewer does not have a girl, never swallowed any pills and wandered through the narrow Brighton lanes, but still yelling something obscene out of solidarity with the main character and feels like somewhere inside inflates a huge balloon. Time flies, the viewer is almost twenty, he has not grown up yet (well, of course!), He's sick of the free love, alcoholic parties and street fightsâ¦ And he remember this movie with gratitude. Already seen, had known, has long been ready., , Dressed in the latest fashion attendants go to hell, newspaper clippings are torn off the walls, almost brand-new-looking âVespaâ turns into a pile of rubble. There are Mods, Rockers and other tinsel andâ¦ there is a real you. Sometimes clumsy, childishly naive and forever lonely, but the ability to love and to experience is no worse than for everyone else and therefore, even if it is hard and painful, get up, shake off and move on in the end. You just do not deserve to be a loser. This is a mood this musical creates; along with amazingly inspiring actors' ability to play it makes âQuadropheniaâ a very worthy thing."
"326","Queen of the Mist ","    This is an interesting story, which is based upon true events. The achievement made by this outstanding woman deserved an adaptation on the stage. And the performance turned out to be successful. From the first display, it received positive reviews from both audience and critics. Some of the critics called it odd and esoteric. But they still admitted that this show is unusual, beautiful and that it breaks the pattern. , , The cast and the crew members, who have created the spectacle, are extremely gifted. The leading composer Michael John LaChiusa is a prominent person in the field of music for esoteric shows. He is also a nominee of Tony Awards. He won an award for this musical as well. It was Frederick Loewe Award in 2012. The songs for this play are utterly beautiful and tuneful. Each composition is in harmony with the storyline. Listen, for example, the song of the leading actress, which has already been called a self-empowerment anthem. , , Actors were perfectly selected. It is necessary to mention the leading actress. Mary Testa is good not only at acting, but also in singing. Her voice is marvelous. She is also a two-time nominee for Tony Award. She is popular for her early roles in âIn Trousersâ (in 1979) and the first part of ""Marvin Trilogyâ, both created by W. Finn. The actress has frequently worked with the composer of this show as well. Her roles in Michael John LaChiusaâs creations include âFirst Lady Suiteâ, âMarie Christineâ and some others. Her acting in this musical is outstanding. All that a viewer can see is her beautiful costume, sparkling eyes and, of course, her voice. Even though her heroine had a kind of tragic fate, as she died poor and forgotten, Testa managed to make her funny and sensible. It was reached thanks to her talent in comedy. Her visual look also made the heroine much more attractive. Testa brought the staging another nomination for Lucille Lortel Award in the category of the Outstanding Lead Actress. The other performers, such as Andrew Samonsky and Julia Murney make the whole performance more alive., , The staging itself is unique and unusual. You will not see lots of decorations and secondary actors. All you see is Testa in the center of the show, six other supporting performers and the orchestra, containing violin, pianos, woodwinds and cello. There is also a bathtub and a bed on the stage. But despite such minimalism, the musical makes us love it. The sets are perfectly used in order to reflect the journey of the main character in the limited space. Sandra Goldmark turned to be a gifted designer., , The visual look of Testa deserves the attention as well. Her dress and hairstyle match her character best. From the very beginning, you can see that she is not like all the other ordinary actresses in the leading roles. Sometimes you canât help waiting something funny for her, as she is a comedian actress. But her acting appears to be very concentrated on the image she has â her black dress, tight corset and grey hair â everything helps to create the necessary atmosphere and impression. K. Rohe together with the assistant did their best. Everything in this musical deserves our attention and praise. You will see s true story, framed by excellent decorations, gifted acting, singing and dancing."
"327","Quilters ","    At the heart of the musical is a book âThe Quilters: Women and Domestic Artâ, created by Norma Bradley & Allen P. Cooper. In this work were collected stories of real immigrants who mastered the Wild West. The authors used records from the diaries of women who left after their husbands to distant uninhabited regions. Artwork of B. Damashek and M. Newman consisted of separate stories, almost unrelated to each other. Around women, creating a quilt, these stories were constantly reproduced. The actresses playing the daughters were transformed into other characters, regardless of their gender. They show the audience joy and sorrow faced by the first settlers in the unexplored and wild lands., , Designer Sandy Eggleston widely used a variety of colors when creating outfits for a musical. Bright costumes of member underlined that, despite the great difficulties, people continued to seek their fortune far away from civilization. They have created a little feasts and celebrations for themselves. Thanks to stenography of Maggie Modig, audience saw on the stage: windmill, wood-burning heated stove, fences and straw. This has contributed to plunge of the audience into a special world of pioneers and their way of life. Soft lighting of Rick Swink also helped to reproduce on stage that distant time. For Paul Loebach, production in 2016 was the directorial debut. According to the critics, he was able to combine skillfully different stories in one concise mosaic. , , Broadway version has not caused interest among the public. To its low popularity also contributed negative reviews from critics. According to many reviewers, the musical did not give the impression of a concise show â it was a set of different numbers, united only by a common theme. Also was noted too much static of performanceâs artists. But there were critics who turned their attention to the positive aspects. Easiness and honesty of the play made a good impression on the impartial spectators. Also considered that the basis of the play were real stories of women-migrants. Despite the brevity of stay on Broadway, the musical was 6 times nominated for Tony. Modern productions were accepted by critics more favorably than the original one. Interest to many musical numbers from the audience allowed this show to continue its theatrical life."
"328","Radio City Christmas Spectacular ","    The show in the Radio Hall is traditional. It is always about Christmas and it is full of joy. But this very performance is unique, featuring the Rockettes â a popular women band from New York. The critics were positive about the staging. The first think, all of them mention, is the decorations. Set designers and technical assistants did their best. The attention of the audience is attracted by large snowflakes, located on the globes. They are operated by special GPS technology and look wonderfully. The performance was called extravaganza filled with high tech. But still the spectacle is also considered a bit old-fashioned.  , , Jesus Christ is worshipped on the stage. The scenes from the Bible are beautiful. The choreography is one of the main parts of the show, as the music band in the center of the plot is specialized in dancing. Their movements are beautiful and perfectly coordinated. In the scene with wooden soldiers, the women look exactly like them. Of course, you cannot forget their famous karate kicks and pretty legs. The choreographer â Linda Haberman â appeared to be a real professional. It is said that she has trained the performers like crazy, making their dances outstanding. Being also a director, she turned this play into a greeting card to whole New York., , Haberman has become a driving force for the show. She made the audience to immerse into the magic of Christmas with the help of technologies and her own ideas brought to life. She applied 3DLive effects and projections. This woman also directed other productions, which were outside New York. She was responsible for Radio City Christmas Spectacular theater tour, which gave performances in Nashville, Boston and Durham. The visual look of women is marvelous. Their hairstyles and costumes are original, bright and colorful. It was reached by the great and hard work of costume designers. Green sparkling suits of the elves and golden glittering dresses of fairies are amazing. The atmosphere of magic is everywhere. , , Not only dances, but also songs deserve the attention of the viewers. The talented composers Gary Adler, Mark Hummel and Michael Patrick Walker did an extremely good job. The music is melodious and joyful. It adds to the whole atmosphere of miracle. The words, written for this musical by Mark Waldrop and Mark Hummel are nice and warm. The production is a mixture of fairy tale and reality. The topic, connected with The Rockettes, became very popular. Later, it was also used in the years of 2012 and 2013. Every year it was transformed, as more and more new effects were applied by designers and technicians., , The magical journey of the main characters, which is in the center of the plot every year, and the religious motives make the audience feel the upcoming holiday. It was created for Christmas and it is about Christmas. It tells not only about a plain holiday. A viewer can be filled with high spirits, believe in miracle and create festive mood. The musical is a good thing on the threshold of Christmas and in any other day of the year, as the spectacle is full of joy, happiness, faith and positive emotions."
"329","Ragtime ","    The production received positive reviews from the critics. The original version is thought to be a bit more successful and interesting than the following revivals. The one, which was created in 2009, was considered to lose weight compared to the first Broadway run., , Despite some differences, each staging contains wonderful songs of various styles, including marches, cakewalks, gospel and ragtime. Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty wrote beautiful songs for the play, observing important historical realities. They masterly transformed the events in the novel into a flow of compositions, creating a story., , Most of the critics and the audience still prefer the 2009 musical. Marcia Milgrom Dodge, who was both a director and a choreographer, made it a perfect example of historical drama. This performance was the first one, she directed for Broadway. Before this, she worked with Off-Broadway productions. Her experience appeared to be utterly successful. The spectacle was nominated for seven Tony Awards. The critics saw a human soul in this version. It is said that it has been absent in the original staging. The production is called a bit overdone â it might be too much for a viewer to watch overdressed characters and listen to heavy messages, as the subject matter is quite serious. But the musical is still pleasant. The characters are changed compared to the book. You can see more self-analysis here, while they stay mysteries to themselves in the novel. , , The set designer did a good job, reflecting America of early 1920s. But the decorations are not too bright and noticeable, as the characters are more important. People are shown as the makers of history. The leading actors of the 2009 version were not too impressive. Compared to those from the original spectacle, who were the rising stars of that time with their own charisma, Stephanie Umoh and Quentin Earl Darrington seem a bit dreary. Each production deserves the attention, but the one directed by Marcia Milgrom Dodge has the glimmers and sensitivity, which were absent in the previous musical variants."
"330","Raisin ","    The adaptation of L. Hansberryâs novel was positively accepted by the critics. Though some of them claimed that the book for the musical is a bit better than the staging itself, it was still called lovely and warm. The reviews said that both those, who do not like musicals and those, who like them, would enjoy the production. It is quite unusual for the Broadway performances. The critics also notice that the wall were broken, the speech was realistic and perfectly mixed with sounds of musical instruments. Compared to the novel, some sass and action were added to the show., , Donald McKayle, who was chosen to be a director, did an amazing job. Being a talented dancer, he also did his best in choreography for the spectacle. He was nominated for Tony and Emmy Awards for plenty of times, which is one of the reasons, why the staging became so successful. Being a Professor of Dance at University of California, Irvine, he managed to create beautiful movements and trained the performers hardly. As a director, he applied ensemble-acting concept. It means that the acting is observed in complex, by the whole cast and not by a single actor. , , All the performers are called outstandingly strong. There is no weak acting in the play. Look, for example, at Ernestine Jackson, who took part in both original and revival version of the musical. This âHello, Dolly!â star was magnificent in her roles. Her acting brought a Theatre World Award and a nomination for Tony Award in the original spectacle. The secondary role actors were good as well. The characters of Bjorn DuPaty and Andy Prosky are remarkable for conviction. , , The production is often referred to as tragedy, as dreams of the main heroes were not fulfilled. But there is a kind of hope here anyway. They made a big step forward, little things changed for the better. The spectacle had a great influence on both society and the industry of musicals. Some years later, there was another staging called âClybourne Parkâ written. There is a reference to this production in it, as the house of the main characters is mentioned. , , Concerning the music, it is marvelous. There are motives from ballads and gospel, African love songs and parts of some other styles. But it seems that songs are not too important here. The most striking thing is still the acting. Music just completes the show. Set decorations are simple, but exact. The bar, the park and the house are perfectly designed. As for the suits, they reflect America of 1950s. Bernard Johnson is a master of costume design. Everything in this show deserves the attention of the audience â nice costumes, gifted acting, beautiful voices and dances. The musical has its own heartbeat, which will touch the souls of every viewer."
"331","Redhead ","    It is not just a musical; it is a murder mystery, placed on the stage. This genre was popular during the time, the original version was staged, and it is still quite famous. Critics were positive about the performance. They especially mentioned the leading actress â Gwen Verdon. She is said to make the show successful. It was not her debut work on Broadway. She has already participated in several spectacles by that time. Besides her talent in acting, she was a great dancer, which also added to the general popularity of this histrionics. Verdon used to be an assistant choreographer, working together with Jack Cole. The actress received Tony Award for almost every role in various productions. She brought a reward for this staging as well. Verdonâs play had such convince that many people say the show should never be revived. None of the actresses would be able to repeat such a triumph., , The second leading actor â Richard Kiley â perfectly completed the picture. His voice is thought to be one of the most striking and beautiful in the history of Broadway. His appearance is gorgeous as well. He got Tony Award for his acting in this performance., , The second husband of the leading actress â Bob Fosse â had a debut work in this production as a director. The continuation of his work had brought him many others directing engagements. His experience appeared to be good, as the spectacle became popular. His direction and gifted choreography made the show stylish and creative. At the beginning of his work, he had an idea to star in the play as a real killer. But it happened that he had lots of other obligations. Leonard Stone replaced him and was nominated for another Tony Award for the performance as the Best Featured Actor. In his turn, Fosse did excellent job and brought two more Tonies â for the Best Musical and Best Choreography., , The noticeable cooperation of Verdon and Fosse was not the last for this production. In 1966, they co-worked again and brought great success to the whole crew. , , The composers deserve a separate word. Lyrics by Dorothy Fields and Albert Hague managed to create catchy music and witty lines. The songs were made the way the leading actress could dance a lot and have enough time to breathe. Verdon needed plenty of energy for her performance. As she had a task to show her talent in choreography, the strongest signing parts were given to Richard Kiley. He is perfect in both solo and duo compositions. The best songs were included into the cast album, including his duets with Verdon and Stone. , , Being based upon a simple, even mediocre material, the gifted members of the crew were able to elevate it somehow. Even the set and costume designs turned to be outstanding. Rouben Ter-Arutunian got another Tony for his wonderful work. Even though the musical cannot be called a masterpiece, both critics and viewers agree that it definitely worth the attention. There are many things to admire and enjoy in this spectacle, staring from tuneful music and creative dances and ending with amazing acting and nice decorations. You can give it a try and spend a wonderful evening."
"332","Reefer Madness ","    The staging is not very extravagant, like, for example, Moulin Rouge. But it has its charm anyway. The original film is a real drama, created to threaten the parents, showing them, what might happen in case their children try marihuana. The musical is a kind of satire on that melodramatic thing. Serious issues can also be found here though., , Kevin Murphy and Dan Studney â the creators of the show, and have already become famous for their work on âDesperate Housewivesâ and âWeird Scienceâ. They immediately understood that the original movie was just a perfect material for satire. From the film, they only took the storyline and a character of the lecturer. Then they added exaggerated things, such as cannibalism, Jesus Christ visions, blatant copulations and so on. Both the audience and the critics liked the staging. After getting praise and rewards, it received a chance on Off-Broadway stage. The musical turned to be so fabulous that it received a movie adaptation in 2005., , Tony Kelly, who directed the New York spectacle, made it a bit closer to the original film. He was also a director for âRaceâ. The actors were good enough. Their acting is convincing. As for choreography, made by Brittany and Carmichael Blankenship, it appeared to be fantastically strong. Giulio Perron created minimalistic, but wonderful decorations, and costume design by Jean Cardinale was fantastic. They not only reflect the time, but also feature the characteristics of the heroes. Look, for instance, at Mary. This heroine is perfectly described by her appearance as a good girl. Such outstanding costumes allowed one and the same actor to play various roles. The cruel hero Jack is displayed as a boss of a reefer with his plain outfit and a gun., , Beautiful songs, written by Kevin Murphy and Dan Studney, should be mentioned as well. They contain both drama and giggles. Each composition leads the storyline. The critics still consider the musical to be rather funny than outstanding. But the acting and voices are highly-estimated anyway. The performance gives an opportunity to relax and to laugh. If you want something serious and challenging â this is not for you. But such play will make you relax and enjoy."
"333","Rent ","    The idea to create a musical based on the opera of Giacomo Puccini âLa BohÃ¨meâ belonged to the playwright B. Aronson. A year later â in 1989 â he began working with 29-year-old composer J. Larson. The young man suggested that the action of the musical should take place against a background of poverty of passionate life of gays, transvestites and Manhattan punks, who did not have their own home. Also to the composer belonged the idea of the playâs name. In 1991, J. Larson decided to start writing the histrionics at his own. He asked permission from B. Aronson to use his concept during the creation of the production. Entered into an agreement to obtain a share of the Broadwayâs income from production, the playwright has given his consent. , , The author has written over a hundred songs, but the musical included only 42 of them. After the preliminary readings, it was revealed that the show required a large enough amount of improvements. Implementing them, J. Larson presented musical in NY Theatre Workshop. On the eve of the first official off-Broadway show, composer was interviewed by A. Tommasini. This journalist from âThe New York Timesâ noted that the beginning of the play coincided with the 100th anniversary of the debut of the opera by Giacomo Puccini. The next morning, Jonathan Larson died. Try-outs were canceled. Instead, friends and relatives of the composer listened to the songs from the musical, performed by actors in loving memory of the deceased author. , , A few months later, there was the premiere of a spectacular on Broadway. The production was enthusiastically perceived by the audience, to which greatly contributed the recent death of its creator. Critics welcomed the new musical with open hearts. Reviewers noted not only the music part, but also its realization on the stage. They drew attention to the fact that the heroes of performance, being infected with HIV, continued to live and to love each other. The musical won the hearts of many fans. There was even invented a special name for them â âRent-headsâ. These people spent the night in front of the theaterâs cash desks waiting for the 20-dollar tickets, which have been released for sale on the day of the Broadway premiere. Also, the fans tried not to miss the shows started in other cities. During the show at the Broadway, one person beheld 1100 performances of this production, making a record by this., , Production made a big impression on critics, winning Pulitzer Prize and Drama Desk Award, scoring to 6 wins out of 10 nominations. The musical also won the Drama League Award, NY Drama Critics' Circle & 2 Theatre Worlds. The performance 10 times has been nominated for Tony, winning 4. London production in 1998 received 3 nominations for the Laurence Olivier Award. Box office for 12 years of the Broadway show made 280 million dollars."
"334","REPO! The Genetic Opera ","    In 1996, Darren Smith witnessed the dramatic bankruptcy of his friend, whose property was confiscated without foreclosure. This story has seriously affected the young composer. Eventually, he came up with the future world, where in the case of non-payment from a person were extracted parts of the body in the same way as if they were an ordinary property. D. Smith met future collaborator in musical Terrance Zdunich in South Coast Theatre. In 1999, they created the duet âThe Galleryâ and began to compose 10-minute operas. Two authors presented their works in different clubs of Los Angeles. For the musical part was responsible D. Smith, while T. Zdunich performed mini-operas. For the first time the future world appeared in the history of man, who was forced to engage in looting the graves, to earn money for the next payment for the operation of organs transplantation. This 10-minute opera was really liked by the audience, and the authors decided to expand it to a full-scale musical. , , In 2002, D. L. Bousman joined the duo â he wanted to do the screening adaptation of the show. After 4 years, the director shot short film to preliminary exhibition of it to the producers. After 48 hours from that moment, LGF / Twisted Pictures have provided funding for the adaptation of the production. The film did not include a significant number of songs that were present in the original musical. Due to the change in management of the company, in advertising of the finished motion picture no funds were invested before the premiere. The financial failure of the film destroyed the authorsâ plans to shoot the prequel of the story. Critical reviews on the picture were mostly negative. Have been marked excessively gloomy atmosphere of the film, violence and obscene language of characters. Nevertheless, there were viewers who evaluated well the phantasmagoric world of the future, and the ambiguity of the characters of the picture."
"335","Ring of Fire ","    For many years, producers asked the musician Johnny Cash to allow the creation of stage production based on his songs. But only in 2003, after getting acquainted with the idea of a revue, he allowed W. Meade to use his works in the show. Soon Johnny Cash died. W. Meade turned to Richard Maltby, Jr. with a request to create theatrical production based on the songs of the musician. He gave the future director a large amount of literature and CDs with recordings of J. Cash. Thinking over the concept of a new product, R. Maltby immediately gave up the idea to make the main character of the theatrical Johnny Cash himself. He knew that no one could adequately impersonate the great musician on stage. It was also decided not to focus on the fact that the core of revue would be the biography of J. Cash. As a result, the author received a mythical American tale about growing up of a young man who was born in the countryside., , Broadway production received mixed reviews from critics. Due to the low sales of tickets, show lasted on the stage just 6 weeks after its premiere. During the penultimate weekend before closure, organizers received box office of only USD 229 849 dollars instead of the planned USD 784 992. After the end of the show, it was suggested that this play was not suitable for large theaters. A new subsequent production in the chamber-small Mercury Theater has made a very favorable impression of critics. The audience also appreciated the theatrical. Due to the fact that it took place on the smaller stage, the audience felt semblance with the story told. Many of them pointed out that they went through similar tests, which have been described in the Johnny Cashâs songs about his life. Revue caused positive emotions from the fans of the style of country and blues, and from the people who had other interests in music. Some critics have even expressed the hope that in the future this play would be likely produced in small theaters, because this show was really perfect for modest-size scenes."
"336","Rink","    Originally, it was a small off-Broadway musical, created by F. Ebb & J. Kander. Screenwriter was A. Innaurato, director â A. Laurents. The project turned out unsuccessful, so the authors invited another writer to create a totally new libretto. They also replaced the director of the play. The brainchild of Terrence McNally was way more successful and advanced musical went into production. For the main roles have been chosen the famous Broadway actresses. The show's creators were not sure in a positive answer of Liza Minnelli, when invited her to be the daughter-hippie. But after learning that in the theatrical will participate Chita Rivera, actress immediately agreed to join the project. As later explained in an interview, Mrs. Minnelli at the age of 13 saw a great acting of this woman and decided to follow her footsteps. For Dolores Conchita Figueroa de Rivero (Chita Rivera) it was a turning point in her career. Due to the role of the mother in the play, she received Drama Desk Award (as an outstanding actress) and Tony (Best Actress)., , Broadwayâs production caused different reactions from critics. Many of them noted the gloomy atmosphere of the musical, as well as overly dramatic events that happen to its characters. The show's creators have tried to reveal the situation without embellishment, which began to emerge in the late 70's â large gangs of punks, threatening to the safety of people, has become the norm of that time. Critics have also noticed that the product did not have enough music and lyrical intensity. Although this was the hallmark of other productions of these authors. Some reviewers have noticed that the libretto looked quite weighty even without songs present in the show. After the departure of Liza Minnelli from the project, she was replaced by S. Channing. This actress was unable to win the recognition of the audience and the musical was soon removed from the display."
"337","Roar Of The Greasepaint","    A. Newley & L. Bricusse decided to create an unusual musical parable about the clash between the British social classes. According to the authors, the action takes place after a nuclear disaster. Performed in the allegorical form of vaudeville, the play revealed the injustice that prevailed in contemporary reality between rich and poor people of British society. The authors of the musical did not possess the music literacy, so they sang the melodies to their friend Ian Fraser, who then wrote them down on paper. The name of the play consists of a converted theater-performersâ phrase â âthe smell of the greasepaint, the roar of the crowdâ. , , Before a possible show in the West End, it was a tour in the country. British beholders did not appreciate this work, and the musical did not get to the capital. The tour stopped after 2.5 months after the start. Due to the fact that the show was seen by an American producer, it moved to the New World. D. Merrick decided â better to hold first the national tour. Such tactics have brought success to another English musical under his leadership. He also made a recording of the spectacular. Even while touring, the producer succeed to return the money invested by him in this project. Execution by singer Tony Bennett songs from the musical made a play famous even before its appearance on Broadway. Several other songs also became hits in 1965. The producer changed a part of the show for the American public, to make it more easily perceived., , Broadway version enjoyed great success with audiences and critics. Thanks to the highest acting talents of A. Newley & C. Ritchard, the play managed to achieve the necessary atmosphere, which could not appear in the British production. Wit and subtle irony inherent in the musical were greatly transferred by these artists. The audience took the unusual satirical show, even though it was politically backgrounded. Many of the songs of the musical became hits. Subsequently, they were performed by well-known bands and artists, such as Muse, Pussycat Dolls, Barbra Streisand, and George Michael. , , 24 years after its creation, production eventually reached the West End. But in Broadway musical was no longer represented. In the XXI century, several productions have been carried out, including the histrionics of 2002 in the framework of the program âMusicals Tonight!â. Many critics have noted that the musical has not lost its relevance in modern times. Its satire will continue to show the ugly sides of human society, until there will be no social classes that divide people into rich and poor."
"338","Rock Of Ages ","    It would be, of course, nice to get familiar with the plot of the musical before heading to watch, but it's not the only way. Hearing the name âRock of Agesâ, anyone would have guessed that the rock and brutal men there would be more than in melodramatic stories. However, many people would chase for a sob stories of love, but it was not quite there. Hair, long hair, much long beautiful hair. Did we mention that it was man's long hair?! Yes, shiny hair of men â that's what captivates from the first minute. When the initial shock receded a little, the attention was drawn to music. Actually, if you are not a fan of rock music and your tastes are absolutely other, you would understand that if a person loves love stories, loves more drama, he or she unlikely listens to metal. But, having listened to it, may occur a feeling that you should have paid more attention to this style. It is a deep, varied and enjoyable to the ear. Sounded from the stage music was possible to compare with the work of Jon Bon Jovi or Pat Benatar (with whose creativity you would certainly meet already in this staging). , , Solo guitar, beautiful leather jackets of musicians, and hairstyles in the spirit of the 80 â well, you may be smitten. Besides, how could you remain indifferent to the story of a young man who dreams of becoming a famous musician, and to be closer to the hang-out, and who agrees to work as the waiter at the bar?! Certainly, it captivates. , , The image of Sherrie seemed comical, who in despair rushes into the arms of the first rocker. One unfortunate date â and she is already torn to pieces. A bit weak for the person who came from the province to conquer the show business, huh? , , But the public certainly would love what happens on the stage. Nearby might sit rockers, dressed from head to toes in the skin, as well as ordinary people, but they all shook their heads along with powerful music and lit own lighters under incredibly melodic semi-ballads. , , We arenât sure whether âRock of Agesâ will be a memorable musical, which will win the sincere sympathy of the audience for many years, but if you are from generation of 80âs, you should definitely visit it to enjoy self."
"339","Rocky Horror Show ","    The cult, scary, funny, absurd â they are not all characteristics, which aptly describe this creation. If you take it through the prism of seriousness, you can give up and lose any desire to watch such projects in the future. But setting yourself to watch a true show, you will get a real pleasure and at the same time, will have a portion of the material for thoughts. Musical wonderfully combines elements of comedy skits, science fiction and even horror. The air literally soars with bi-gender mood, through which the viewer gets acquainted with the main characters and learns their dark side fast. What is happening on the scene can be interpreted in different ways. But, perhaps, its main goal is to demonstrate the secret desires of each person, hidden deep in the soul all life and manifested only in unusual situations. Such transformation we see in a pair of newlyweds Brad and Janet., , Performance can be divided into two parts: before and after getting into the Frankensteinâs Castle. The first takes a short period of time and tells the audience the story of a very ordinary protagonists. With the transition to the second part, events change their course by 360 degrees, and demonstrate on the scene the horrific emotions and irrationality. Scenery and background acquire a bright red hue that successfully emphasizes taking place on the stage transgender development. Particularly noteworthy were costumes of inhabitants of the castle. To call them extraordinary is to say nothing. Most characters worn revealing outfits, including a cabaret corset, black stockings and indecently high heels. And such attires worn not only women but also men. The unprepared person may be shocked, but as noted by critics, it was a brilliant staging move, which has all chances to enter into the history of theatrical art., , Over the years, Tim Curry played a lot of good roles. Some of them relate to the movie, others â to the theater. The best work of the actor is considered a character Frank N Furter. Last represents chaos and debauchery on stage. He is the driving force, capable in one moment to change the course of the plot. Is he considered a hero-villain? Maybe, but only partially. On the role of antagonists of the doctor, his servants suit more, who indulge all his dark business and do not let him to quit even when Furter seriously considers this. The owner of the castle was a free man who did not know the boundaries in the fields of pleasure. He does not intend to spoil his guests deliberately. The doctor just wanted to show them all the charm of transgender life. But by means of what methods did he do it â was entirely other issue., , Music fits well into the overall production. There dominate jazz and rock'n'roll songs. Most of them are devoted to the image of the doctorâs life, as well as his achievements in the field of switched sensuality. Song âSweet Transvestiteâ is a benefit of the creative Tim Curry. All of the voice articulations look great. It is really his way, which would hardly be represented that good by any other actor. The performance thanks to its main performer strikes with charisma and brilliance. But some sense of uncertainty remains, as it takes time to realize the beauty of this creation."
"340","Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific ","    As with the original version of the 1955, Broadwayâs modern staging practically was devoid of weaknesses. Great acting, balanced story, quality scenery and costumes â all this explains more than successful figures in the box office of the play. But most importantly, the creation carries a lot of useful and instructive issues in the story and dialogues. The problem of racism was observed at all times and it appeared very acute in modern society. There were people who blamed the musical in an open promotion of the above-mentioned phenomenon. Those were who either watched the show not completely or not at all watched it and were guided only by the stories of friends or amateur articles from the Internet. In fact, based on the example of the main characters, creators of the production show viewers all stupidity of racial prejudices. Nellie & Emile, Cable & Liat â these characters are faced with the problem of racism. The second pair was not able to be together. What's to blame? Lieutenant banally was afraid of thoughts and talking about him at home, if he would bring Polynesian girl there. As a result, he broke up with her all the relationships, losing a part of himself, and rushed into the thick of the war. As for the second pair, they were able to make the right conclusions and not to repeat the mistakes of the 1st couple. Although there was a moment when it seemed that everything was over. Mr. Hammerstein said many times that his main task as an author was to convey to the people the error of racist attitudes. According to him, the skin color should not alienate you from a person that you really aspire to. And this applies not only to love affairs but also to friendly, social and international relations. , , 7 Tony statuettes and more than 20 other awards once again confirm the thoroughness of each of the element of this staging. In the cast were gathered a lot of talented artists, including the brightly shining star of Kelli O'Hara (she depicted Nellie). The audience had a unique opportunity to observe the multi-faceted reincarnation of her character. Initially, on the scene appears naive nurse wanting to love and to be loved. Then she gradually evolves and begins to experience negative emotions in relation to the local population. And the final incarnation of Nellie, whereby she begins to appreciate every moment of her life and refuses to have any prejudice against people of other races. Everything looks so believable that it is wanted again and again to watch the game of this actress, and each time reward her with loud applauses. P. Szot, M. Morrison & L. A. Sayre also remarkably coped with their roles, but their characters did not have had such freedom, as was observed in the case of Nellie. , , Music, costumes and stage design â that's what really adorns in the considered musical. For the three above-mentioned items, it also received several awards, including Tony. Most of the songs are of lyrical and romantic character. Only their hue changes: in some episodes it is characterized by positive notes, and in others â by dramatic. With regard to the background music, there dominate the Bali island motifs. Costumes can be divided into two types: uniform of American soldiers and ethnic clothing of Pacific Islanders. Last was sewed by original Balinese craftsmen, which significantly increases their value and the similarity with the original outfits of those times. , , We have here one of the most multi-faceted projects of the 21st century, each element of which is on its place. In addition to the cultural component, the theatrical has a great social value. On simple examples of life, it shows how much can be lost if a person holds for ideas of racism. But throwing them away, everyone will lose absolutely nothing, only gain instead."
"341","Rooms A Rock Romance ","    It is a musical about music. It sounds great, but looks even better. It can be concluded that the basis of the creation is the relationship between a man a woman, as well as the desire of each individual character to achieve success in life. Correct to say that Monica and Ian concluded a profitable alliance that later grew into something more. Against this background, sounding onstage music fades into the background and plays a supporting role. The latter is to give one or another episode the atmosphere, emphasizing certain moments and characters, supporting the dynamism of the narrative line. Music is everywhere. It is an integral part of the life of a young couple, and at the same time tells about the life of this pair to the beholder. It sounds like a paradox, but in practice, this translates into a really interesting and outstanding result. , , Matthew Deitchman and Hillary Marren brilliantly played major roles. The creative character of Ian has been depicted by an actor with incredible talent, at the same time not boasting with emotional stability. As for Monica, she is characterized by completely different qualities. The girl is focused, tenacious and she has a desire to be the best in everything (like Monicaâs character from Friends serial movie). The only thing that unites the above characters â love to art and especially to music. Each viewer will with interest see the reincarnation of rocker. Will they be able to live without music? Of course, not. Music brought them together and helped to become what they are. In this regard, it has a significant place among other values of already married life of Ian and Monica. , , The scene is decorated as a classic eatery in Scotland, where rock musicians usually perform. Interestingly that plot changes in moving of protagonists first in London, and then in New York, have little effect on its appearance. The play consists of a single act, and that is why the creators do not produce replacement of sets/props and only adjust the original background. The same goes for the costumes, which are only at the initial stage characterized by restraint and dull tones. The musical has the potential to become a classic in the future. Its main feature â a demonstration of the relationship of people from neither romantic nor dramatic point of view, but in terms of achieving success. Of course, over time, the characters begin to love each other truly, but most of the creation is dedicated to their partnership. Events on the stage successfully backed up with alive and thrilling music. The impression may arise at the output that you've been not in the theater, but at the rock concert."
"342","Rude Awakening ","    There can be many debates about the merits of this musical, but best of all its quality confirms the 30-year experience on the stage. In the history of theatrical art, such result has been achieved only by a few projects, even much more serious. This means that creation is valued by the audience and they do not bother to see it again and again. Awards? This play is not tuned to collect neither general nor personal awards. Its main purpose â to show the audience funny parodies of the beloved classic and contemporary musicals. And it is not about ridiculing the original performances, no. On the contrary, the creators pay tribute, for example, to conditional Mary Poppins or Jersey Boys, causing people to feel a certain sense of nostalgia. The comic element is a supplement that charges with positivity and gives a unique opportunity to look at the good Freddy Krueger, as an example., , Music is an integral part of supporting fun atmosphere. Forbidden Broadway: Rude Awakening, Curtains For Curtains, and the rest of the compositions are made in a dynamic and slightly ironic style. By themselves, they are not causing the audienceâs laugh. But at the same time, each song perfectly underlines the facial expressions and gestures of the actors, the behavior of their heroes, and so on. Parody reached to the song titles. Against the general background stands out the track âSupercalifragilisticexpialadociousâ. After reading it well from the first attempt, you without hesitation can arranged yourself to be a speech therapist. , , Acting here, as in most other comic projects, is reduced to the second line. This does not mean that the performers arenât coping with their task. They do as much as it is required from them. The fact is that in the foreground are musical scenery, makeup and costumes. They are worked-out on âA+â. A variety of costumes affects. During the play, it is possible to see more than 50 vivid images, completely different from each other. An example of the mentioned can serve an episode in which on the one scene are witch characters, Mary Poppins, the Greek god Zeus and a singer dressed in a blue dress. All this shows originality of the project and partly explains how it manages to stay afloat for more than 30 years. The viewers are always in need of fun creations, while watching which, they could forget about everyday problems and enjoy the action on the stage."
"343","Salad Days ","    Unusual musical was created in 9 years after the end of World War II. The optimism of that time, and the coronation of Elizabeth II left their mark on the atmosphere of the piece. Uncontrollable youth and catchy music, presented in the histrionics, gave the musical a very long life in the UK. Julian Slade and Dorothy Reynolds invented this show to close the summer season of Bristol Old Vic's Resident Company in just three weeks. Despite the great success with the local audience, the creators did not even think about promoting of musical on West Endâs stages. , , A simple story, wit, excellent lyrics and very catchy melodies attracted the attention of the Londonâs businessmen. The production with the same cast moved to the British capital. The grand success of production has been a pleasant surprise for the musicalâs creators. The audience immediately appreciated light and fun performance. Vaudeville Theatre has been visited by Elizabeth II, the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret. The staging was liked by the representatives of the ruling monarchy. Later Princess Margaret even bought this musicalâs notes. , , During the year, the play recouped the production costs and began to bring real profits. This histrionics became the first British performance, which could divert attention of the audience from the American shows, transferred to the West End. Moving the production overseas in Canada was successful â local audiences also appreciated the work. But due to the strike of newspapersâ workers, the New Yorkâs off-Broadway premiere was unnoticed. The musical has not received any reviews from critics and was removed from the display when funds of producers ended. , , Due to the unusual story, the play was very memorable to the audience. The idea that it was possible to dance continuously, was liked by many people. Despite the apparent frivolity, musical raised quite serious problems. The fight of youth for the right to organize their own future independently, attempts of authorities to take under control citizens in all spheres of life â even in fun, the desire to overcome the inertia and higher social classâ snobbery â these all were perfectly disguised with original tunes and great performance of dances. , , The modern versions of this musical arenât so relevant, but the rejuvenating stream of youth and joy still delights audiences and critics. Particular attention of the audience attracted new production of 2009. Reviewers noted that the director B. Bankes-Jones was able to transfer into our time carefree atmosphere of the original production. Melodious songs liked the majority of the audience. Staging resumed during the Christmas for two seasons. The beauty and originality of the musical remain to this day demanded by the public, despite the fact that since the creation of this play, it has been more than 60 years."
"344","Saturday Night Fever ","    At the heart of this musical is the story of âTribal Rites of the New Saturday Nightâ, composed by Nick Cohn in 1975 for New York Magazine. Also, the plot is based on a scenario by N. Wexler, which was written for the same-named film in 1977. Authors of the musical removed from their work the scenes, which contained violence, racism or drugs. In doing so, they have removed the age limit, which existed for the original motion picture. Subsequently, there were productions, which almost completely repeated the subject of the picture, including the most negative scenes. These ones received a rating, which did not allow teenagers to attend the show. , , Songs of band âBee Geesâ, which were performed in the musical, were bright disco songs. Amongst the most enchanting settings was number of dancing in a nightclub. Unusual choreography by Arlene Philips completely recreated on stage the atmosphere of bygone 70s. Thanks to her work, dance competition, which was attended by the main characters, made a great impression on the audience. Scenery by R. Wagner, who created a Broadway version, included model of the bridge named Verrazano Narrows. , , The original production received a variety of responses. Many critics did not like such a version of the show. By removing realism, present in the original film, the makers had too simplified their brainchild. Drawing attention to the fact that the film, which was the basis of the story, became a cult, the reviewers noticed â the production was too lightweight and frivolous. It has strongly influenced the public, as many beholders expected to see in the musical dramatic scenes. Also not in the best way was built the structure of the show. During some most famous music in the hall, people from the audience were frankly bored. , , Despite certain shortcomings of production, this musical called public interest. To the pre-Broadway production was bought a large number of tickets. By the end of the show, the audienceâs interest began to decline â cash box for the penultimate weekend of the finals totaled to 326,476 dollars. Conclusive weekend showed the best result â was collected the amount of $ 856,258. The show did not get much recognition from theatergoers â it was nominated just for two awards. Nevertheless, this play became popular around the globe thanks to disco style, which was loved by many people."
"345","Say, Darling ","    The musical is an adaptation of a semi-autobiographical novel by Richard Bissell, in which the writer talked about how has been created a theatrical production following his other work. In his book, the writer portrayed the famous representatives of the New York Broadwayâs show business. Focusing on the life experience, the writer has created a novel about the adaptation of the bookâs plot for the scenario of the future musical. New product of R. Bissell has become very popular, so it was decided to stage it., , J. Styne attracted to the creation of the production a Broadwayâs veteran Abe Burrows. He also connected to the work on the screenplay R. Bissell himself and his wife Marian. In order to revive the comedy, has been made the decision to enter into the histrionics a number of songs. They were presented as numbers, performed by actors auditioned for the musical. Also the spectacular included songs based on the book by J. Jordan. In this production were used the effect of the show inside of the show, which made it possible to present in the play performances of various music styles. , , At first, Burrows ignored actor R. Morse â after audition, the director did not give him any role. The actor at the time has had very serious financial difficulties. The man did not have enough money even for food, and it affected his appearance a lot. When Jule Styne saw as R. Morse goes away from audition, he stopped the actor. The composer took him to the dress store. There J. Styne bought for Robert a new suit, shirt, tie and coat. Composer asked a man to go casting again the next morning. Burrows immediately confirmed an actor for the role of producer Ted Snow. Subsequently, the director said that he had never met with Robert Morse before. It is this actor later won Theatre World Award, and was nominated for a Tony Award. , , The public really liked Broadwayâs theatrical. Most critics also reacted favorably to this show â the musical has not impressed only a critic from âThe New York Timesâ. Many reviewers noted that the show was very funny, charming and heart-felt. They also draw readers' attention to an ingenious material flow â Richard Bissell has shown in his work the Broadway productionâs pitfalls and troubles behind the scenes that occurred when creating every theatrical production. Despite the high initial interest of the public, the show in subsequent years rarely appeared at the theaterâs stages. In modern times, this production performed mainly in programs that tell about the story of old musicals."
"346","Scarlet Pimpernel","    At the heart of the musical is the eponymous novel by Baroness Emma Orczy, written by her in 1905. The first Broadway production was extremely unfortunate. Critics have recognized this production unviable. After the failure of the show, it was decided to replace the director and choreographer. In their place, they have invited R. Longbottom. The musical has undergone significant reorganization â its story has been rewritten and revised. Typically, such changes were practiced in trial productions, first taking place on the stages of regional theaters. The public first saw revising of an unsuccessful production during its Broadway depiction., , Critics appreciated significant changes in the new production. In their opinion, the revised show was more vivid. A romantic story line was now clearly seen in the play. Also, choreography of staging improved. But the second version of the production was not ideal too. The third version of the play the same did not bring the expected success to a show. All Broadway productions have not paid off and were closed with losses. Cash collections for the last weekend of the Broadway show (as of Jan. 2, 2000) amounted to 356,377 dollars, which was almost 2 times less than the amount planned by the organizers â USD 674,621. , , Despite the modest gains on Broadway, a musical acquired permanent fans. Music by F. Wildhorn that has created romantic ballads, was appreciated by the viewers. Staging has been attributed to the category of family musicals â its adventure scenes and fights with swords especially liked children. Also, quite a serious set design was created in this piece â in one number on the stage appeared even a whole ship! Play was three times nominated for Tony, four â on Outer Critics Circle Award, twice â on Drama Desk and once â on Drama League. But was rewarded only with Theatre World Award."
"347","School of Rock ","    The musical is an adaptation of the eponymous film made in 2003. The motion picture with Jack Black has collected more than 131 million dollars in the worldâs box office with the production cost of $ 35 million. In April 2013, Andrew Lloyd Webber announced about the acquisition of the rights to transformation of the film into a musical. The composer was going to make the chamber variant with the participation of young actors. Originally, they planned to establish the production in the West End, but because of the strict British legislation on the employment of minors, show has been moved to Broadway. For the first time since 1971, premiere of the musical of A. L. Webber took place not in the British theater, but in the US. The composer used the songs that sounded in the original film, but also created new musical numbers. Webber explained that the audience needed softer tunes for comfortable viewing of a long show. Also, the creator said â in the musical would be paid more attention to the relations between parents and children. This exaggerated the drama part of production., , The audience greeted the Broadway premiere with stormy enthusiasm. Critics told very good things about the new show. They noted that young actors did an excellent job with their challenging repertoire. A. Brightman, performing the title role, perfectly interacted with the children, not trying to outshine them with own vocal abilities. Reviewers have noticed that the musical was very easy and enjoyable to watch. The interest of the audience does not disappear till today. Despite the slight decline in first days of May â the box office for the weekend amounted to 816,811 dollars â in late May the public has more likely visited Broadwayâs production. On May 29, has been  collected an amount of USD 1,082,055 per week. Show has even been noted by theatrical figures and nominated for four Tony Awards. Also, the histrionics has received one nomination at the Outer Critics & Drama League. The theatrical has been presented in 5 categories in Drama Desk & received as well 2 nominations for Astaire Award."
"348","Scrooge ","    Staging is an adaptation of the eponymous 1970âs film. It was shot based on âA Christmas Carolâ book, written by Charles Dickens in 1843. The songs by L. Bricusse for the film formed the basis of this spectacle. The author has personally adapted screenplay, for which then began to make the theatrical. L. Bricusse for few months worked with director Bob Tomson, to achieve the best possible option for the future production of the plot. Cheerful numbers and anticipation of Christmas prevailed in this version of the famous work of C. Dickens. Leslie Bricusse revised approach to the main character of the play. Now the old miser was not an all-up person who has forgotten that he had a heart. This Scrooge, invented for the production, almost did not cause a negative attitude of the public to his ugly behavior. Subsequently, were created two versions of the musical â full-length and 55-minute. An abbreviated version was ideal for school groups and small ensembles. , , Anthony Newley, who played the first role of an old miser, faced with a difficult task â he needed not only to show the negative aspects of his character, but also to appear in the final as a good old man in red attire, handing out gifts to people around. Critics have pointed out that not every artist could cope with task to expose on stage expressive meanness, greed and strife of Scrooge. This point, in their view, did not give the musical to become a full embodiment of the works of Dickens. And if A. Newley managed to get closer to the true Scrooge, than T. Steele was too good person to depict heartless old man., , The show premiered in Birmingham aroused great interest among audiences and critics. Reviews have been different, although many of them pointed out that in the production were some very successful musical numbers. Some people did not like too light-weight version of the story about the old greedy rich. But most critics found histrionics quite acceptable â the show had the atmosphere of the approaching Christmas. Separately, the special effects were highlighted, especially the appearance of spirits of the past, present and future. The play made the viewers not only to think about the possible punishment for sins and maintaining a decent life, but to have an experience of the feeling of the approaching Christmas. Fantastic story with a good ending allowed bringing to the musical even children."
"349","Secret Garden","    The plot of the musical is taken from the same-named product by F. Hodgson Burnett, created by the writer in 1911. Adaptation of the novel was managed by the winner of the Pulitzer Prize Marsha Norman. Also, the composer Lucy Simon joined to the creation of the theatrical. Staging was the first major production of Virginia Stage Company. To prepare for the show, a lot of money have been allocated, which reflected in the high-profile technical stage equipment. Designer Heidi Landesman created special platforms that rapidly transformed the scenery in the show between the shift of the scenes. Also in the spectacle used the vertical panels, moved up or down. To recreate the mysterious garden, used panels embedded in the floor, special lighting and backgrounds. Subsequently H. Landesman received a Tony Award for the Broadway production design. , , Thanks to the introduction of ghosts of Lily in the histrionics, the girl's parents and other characters and creators transformed a children's fairy tale into a more serious work, aimed at an adult audience. Critics have pointed out that this approach reduced the magic that was present in the book of F. Hodgson Burnett. But when the show returned to the original story, the atmosphere of mystery and magic reappeared on the stage. Musical aroused great interest among the public. The Broadway production was 14 times nominated for Drama Desk, winning 3. Also, the show received 3 awards out of 6 nominations at Outer Critics Circle Award. Performance has been nominated also for the NY Drama Critics' Circle, but hadnât won. Production managed to receive 3 victories in 7 categories at the Tony Award. The production was represented on Broadway for less than two years. At the end of the show, the box office for the weekend amounted to 550,724 dollars. The histrionics is still popular in modern audience. As of mid of 2016, this spectacular is carried out in theaters in several countries."
"350","See What I Wanna See ","    The musical âSee What I Wanna Seeâ is the work that we all see things, significant or not, even the most ordinary little things, not in the same way. Everyone filters any event through the prism of own worldview, knowledge and faith. Sometimes versions of the same event are so different that you wonder. And this theatrical is about it. , , Chamber-formed, capacious, bright, but not flashy, it engages the audience from the first seconds. And finely-capacious characters of the main actors force to empathize them in each problem. The priest, who no longer feels the presence of God (just like in the motion picture âFrom Dusk Till Dawnâ), who have lost faith and tries to fill the void in his own way. The actress, who has slipped into the abyss and lost both physical and emotional health, but still believes in salvation. A homeless man, once a successful accountant â the son of a rabbi, waiting for his lucky day to come. The elderly aunt â inveterate atheist who nevertheless confesses that she believes in God. All of them have own story, but they are united by one event â the tragedy of September 11 2001, after which it is difficult to live the same as before., , Jumps from medieval Japan to New York of middle of twentieth century, and after â in XXI are interesting. The beginning of both acts is a scene of intimate merger of the two people in love, each of which carries a desire to kill his or her partner at the time of the highest pleasure. Costumes, makeup, facial expressionsâ¦ they seemed to have stepped on the ground from the traditional Japanese erotic prints. But the director is not in a hurry to divulge the ending. The audience remains in the nescience, who killed whom. Instead, the action moves to New York of the XXth century, where the murder of a man, whose wife had been raped, is investigated. A thief, who has committed a crime, does not try to hide the fact that it was her blood on his hands. On the contrary, he confesses that it was his only chance to receive a beautiful Lily., , The way the directors have written the vision of situation of a murder of each of the 3 characters (wife, husband and rapist), plunges into shock. Rapist imagined that the woman wanted to be in intimate relation with him, and thatâs why it was necessary to get rid of her spouse. Lily was ready to commit suicide for the sake of her husband, but at the last moment changed her mind and killed him. And the husband suspected that his wife hated him and wanted another man. Each one of them was right in his or her way. As a priest who tried to fill the void in his soul where God was before, sees the God's sign, when no one else noticed it."
"351","Seesaw ","    The musical tells the story of the relationship of man and woman, which at first glance is not much different from billions of other such stories. But over time, the audience discovers that staging is not going to go through the use of worn-out patterns. In addition to that, it offers a unique solution, which seems unusual and fascinating. Fully realizing it, the audience gets the incredible pleasure from viewing. This is the case when you want to go to the theater again and again. The final of performance is something higher than the standard happy ending or a tragic conclusion. It analyzes to what has led the bond of the main characters, as well as tries to figure out what each of them was able to make out of it. The main productions message is the following: every acquaintance is able to fill your life with bright colors and to demonstrate completely new things that before you did not even imagine., , Much of the success of the histrionics depended on the actors, performing leading roles. Ken Howard and Michele Lee got greatly used to characters of Jerry and Gittel respectively and showed the audience all the features of their characters. They are the personification of ambition, curiosity and faith in tomorrow. In the background of a guy, a girl looks more creative person, prone to frequent mood swings. At the same time, she does everything possible to demonstrate Jerry the charm of life in New York City. The main characters are very different from each other and that is why their final separation does not cause much surprise. Rather, it is the logical conclusion of a beautiful but short story. Even Viktor Tsoy sang once in his song âThe Sunâ lines: âwho shall die youngâ¦â conclusing that young people are prone to fast love and fast living. AT least, more than elderly ones. At the end, there is a certain confidence that Jerry and Gittel would not cease to communicate and continue to maintain friendly relations. , , A special place in the spectacular devoted to the music and choreography. These two elements are not in the leading roles, but they successfully emphasize every scene. Jazz compositions dominate, backed by exquisite dance numbers. But it all depends on the situation. If in the scene is shown an episode filled with fun, so the music is chosen joyful and dynamic. With the dramatic moments, everything is exactly the opposite, of course., , Production is characterized by a unique idea, which for its time did not seem to be anything revolutionary. Behind all its neutral manner of narration line, lies a strong impression. The latter is for lovers of really exceptional shows."
"352","Seussical ","    To view this staging through the prism of awards, ratings and box office would be wrong. This is a slightly different creature, which main task is to make people happy and to give them a bright sea of emotions. Initially, it may seem that the histrionics is intended only for children, but it is not true. It is based on the cult literary works by Dr. Seuss that easily motivate even the most skeptical adult viewers. Having decided to combine them into a single musical, creators have undertaken some risk. On the other hand, this move has made the play unique in its kind. Until 2000, the Broadway scene never seen anything like it, and after it, one after another began to emerge projects as theatrical interpretation of several books of stories (of this or other authors). In this regard, we can say that considered production contributed to the creation of a new genre in the theatrical art., , Availability of colorful characters would mean a little without professional performers, which could qualitatively bring them to life. Fortunately, the creators have quickly found the right actors. In particular, we are talking about David Shiner and Kevin Chamberlin. First embodied on the scene the Cat in the Hat, the second â Horton the Elephant. The image of the little elephant will remain for a long time in the memory of beholders. So original and colorful characters, which went to save the world, for a long time were absent even in the fairy tales. The rest of the troupe was acting perfectly, but in their case, the more noteworthy were characters themselves rather than their scenic implementation., , Sets and costumes â that is considered the main attractions of this musical. Externally, the scene always looks incredibly colorful. Most of the performanceâ events are held in the Jungle of Nool, but in its execution, they bear a huge resemblance with the classic jungles. Rather, it is a magic forest where magic plays not a lesser role than nature itself. As for the costumes of the main characters, they are performed in bright colors, like the scene itself. When creating images, dressers almost never used monochromatic materials, but the combinations of pink, blue, red and yellow here is in abundance. Red-and-white hat of the Cat has become a symbol of the play, or rather its magical component. , , Behind all its fabulousness, the staging hides a huge part of educational value that could be helpful to all categories of viewers without exception. A play teaches us to appreciate friendship. On the elephantâs example, you can see how important the support of friends is. Without it, the journey of the protagonist unlikely was successful. In addition to all, the musical shows the importance of curiosity and belief in your business. If to abandon everything in the halfway, it is difficult to achieve positive results."
"353","Seven Brides For Seven Brothers ","    This production is good for professional and amateur theatrical interpretations. We can talk long about the merits of West Endâs productions, but first it is needed to explain why Broadway version flopped. The lack of awards and nominations can still be somehow explained, but the closure after 5 performances raises many questions. Its just the creators could not dispose their existing assets well. In simple terms, they set the wrong accents, exposing the weaknesses of the project and hid its virtues. Hunted in the strict confines big-name cast could not show even half of their abilities. This applies not only to artistry but also to vocals. The braked manner of musical narration also spoils the impression. Under the dynamic perfectly written music, a slow imitation of fast action takes place on the scene. In such circumstances was lost the spirit of western and chases with abductions do not cause such hard-core emotions. Perhaps elsewhere musical would go further on its rental, but on Broadway such mistakes shall not be tolerated., , In West Endâs production were corrected most of deficiencies of version-1982. Action taking place on the stage significantly added in the dynamics, and the characters of the actors got more opportunities for self-expression. Such would seem minor changes allowed to demonstrate viewers the real adventure, containing the incredible action, as well as a unique combination of elements of comedy and drama., , Michaela Strachan clearly stood out from the castâs background. This does not mean that the rest of the representatives of the troupe have failed to cope with their task. It is rather the fact that the actress has shown the maximum of own capabilities, performing one of the best roles of her career. In this her character helped significantly. Milly is characterized by stability, commitment and desire to help others to become better. The girl at a young age came to the ranch inhabited by men who saw in her only a housewife. But the main character has not fall under the influence and vice versa began to follow her own line. Largely because of this, each of the brothers found a soul mate, and Adam â her spouse â understood what the true happiness constitutes of. In the acting of such characters as Milly actor either copes or miserably fails. That is why Michaela Strachan went through the first option and won the love of fans., , Costumes and scenery are integral elements of the musical, which deserve a separate mention. They ideally emphasize the tones of the late 19th century. The action looks realistic, and slice of over-acting is minimized. The creators of the show gave the audience a unique opportunity to purchase at the exit clothing identical to ones that have been worn by heroes of the theatrical. This was mainly concerned hats sold for a symbolic price of 10-20 dollars. The play has a unique atmosphere, amazingly eye-catching viewers to events occurring on the stage. Production can be considered a worthy successor of western genre and it still appears on stages of large and small theaters."
"354","She Loves Me ","    Before we proceed directly to consideration of the musical, it is necessary to say a few words about the writer Miklos Laszlo. The latter has the ability to create truly unique romantic comedies. In addition to their main plot, they intrigue readers and show them really unusual story progresses. This is observed in novel âParfumerieâ that formed the basis of this spectacular. Love line comes to the fore only at the end of the action, and the rest of the time is given to the problems of the relationship between the main characters, of which there are as many as seven people. As for the staging itself, the absolute majority of its events occurs within the perfume shop. After a while, viewers get used to stage design and no longer distracted by its details. In this situation, all the focus is on the characters and especially â on their emotions and feelings. It is very interesting to observe how the character of the heroes changes in connection with a particular incident., , The success of the play was largely dependent on the play of actors. B. Baxley, B. Cook, L. Donath, N. Frey & J. Cassidy did not disappoint beholders, and at the appropriate level have realized their stage skills. The latter even won the prestigious Tony Award. Among the other artists, it is necessary to highlight B. Cookâs job. She had a chance to bring to life the most multi-faceted character of production â Amalia. The first appearance of Miss presented her as a strong and slightly emotional personality, able to cope with anything, just to get the job. But once in the perfume shop, Amalia changes dramatically and becomes, without exaggeration, the most romantic heroine of the spectacular. She no longer shows the rigidity of her character. Her main task becomes taking care of personal happiness and the felicity of close friends. During demonstrations, B. Cook literally became Amalia. Actually, it gave the corresponding result on stage. , , Compositions have been made in an interesting style, which combined romance and a certain slice of humor. Many critics unanimously called music monotonous and quickly becoming boring. This has some piece of truth, but do not just give up due to this. The fact that Jerry Bock created music, which fits perfectly into the events in the play, but not able to interest the listener beyond it. An example can be a song She Loves Me. At a separate hearing, it does not cause any excitement, but playing in the acting, the track in a smart way emphasizes the atmosphere of the solemn moment. One view is hardly enough to cover all the charms of the considered creation. This is one of those cases where every new view reveals something neoteric: from the plot moves and musical performance, to the characters and acting."
"355","Shout! ","    There are many categories of musicals: one suitable for children, other â for adults. Some projects are created for men, some â for women. This spectacular is clearly expressed by the representatives of the women group. Its whole idea, dialogues, plot, and events worked out to cause the interest of the beautiful part of population. Due to what it was achieved? First of all, the show says things that excite every girl. It eliminates the presence of hidden ideas, arcane promises, and similar hard themes. Through dialogues and solo performances of main characters, the creators voice traditional women's issues related to home, children and, of course, relationships with men. Such simplicity has always been topical and aroused high interest among the female audience. This fact explains the high popularity of low-budget off-Broadway production. , , The performance is characterized by a non-standard manner of narration. It is a case of spectacular, in which the songs takes more part than the natural dialogues between the protagonists. Of course â it is a musical show, after all! So the main criterion during casting for roles in the project was singing before acting. Without exception, all actresses have great vocal data, which resulted in the emergence of several iconic songs such as âI Only Want To Be With Youâ, âYou Donât Have To Say To Love Meâ. Special attention also deserves an original interpretation of the James Bond Theme. , , The scene is devoid of any tacky elements. But at the same time, it is made in bright colors, highlighting the features of the female nature. The heroines are dressed in gowns of one or two tones, the tinge of which is fully consistent with their name. Changes are made only in the style of clothing, not hue. Thus, The Scarlet Girl is wearing a short youthful dress. As for the older women, long and rigorous ones observed on them (if such a determination is suitable for bright color). The project is interesting and deserves attention if only because of its unusual style and originality. It is similar to âMenopauseâ by K. Lindsey."
"356","Show Boat ","    It is interesting, if amongst Oscar Hammersteinâs musicals are simple, with no hidden subtexts, not teaching and not raising important issues? Probably, not. It is for this reason the above-mentioned figure is considered a genius of theatrical art, and most of his brainchildren have already become classics. With regard to this theatrical, in addition to interesting story, it says of and examines the problem of racism in American society. Hammerstein devoted much time to study of this issue and eventually concluded as soberly thinking person that skin color should not be a barrier in human relations: not in a friendship, and even more â not in love. The theater person decided at every opportunity to point to the falsity of racial prejudice, and ultimately achieved in this area significant progress., , It is difficult to single out one of the strengths of this creation â they are all remarkable. Take, for example, acting game of N. Terris. Actress embodied the central character of the play â Magnolia. Initially she appears to the audience as weak and naive girl, unable to think straight in the love situation. But over the years the main character gets stronger, and thanks to own persistence, provides a future for herself and her daughter Kim. Mrs. Terris masterfully conveyed the transformation of the nature of Magnolia, for which she deserved the recognition of the fans and the highest evaluations from critics. Howard Marsh coped well with his work. His character is somewhat monotonous and revealed from a new side only in the last part of the second act. It is the personification of true repentance, which is so difficult for a lot of people., , Special mention should be given to scenery. They are made in clear river theme. It should be noted that the creators were not limited to artificial background behind the scenes. All elements, including the ship, were made of natural materials and elaborated to the smallest details. This histrionics one of the first resorted to the use of two- and even three-storey scenery. The costumes also gave realism and authenticity to all plot. Female characters were dressed in slightly extended attires, which at that time gradually went out of fashion. On the men were the original costumes of the late 19th century, characterized by the presence of heavily lowered jackets., , It is not surprising that over the years the project has become a classic theatrical art. It simply devoid of weaknesses: everything from acting to stage design is made at the highest level. In addition to this, production carries important social message, which consists of the fact that all people are equal and skin color is insignificant factor."
"357","Shrek ","    You should not directly compare it with the original animated story on TV. Of course, the relationship between these projects is direct, but on the scene, it is not always good to realize animation films with multi-million dollar budget. At the time, the creators of the movie have undertaken a great risk, daring to release this. D. Lindsay-Abaire has repeatedly pointed out that he did not want to copy the well-known story completely, but the great deviation from it was also an unacceptable luxury. The main feature of scenic interpretation is more in-depth study of Shrekâs childhood. Viewers had the opportunity to see the gradual grow of the main character from the little 7-year-old kid, to ogre-hermit living in a remote swamp., , As a rule, in the gaming performances acting fades into the background. This is what happened here, except for one artist â D. Breaker. Last embodied Donkey â the most cheerful character in the story, on which all comic elements held. Here the beholder is faced with the highest class of acting, beautiful singing and important charisma, without which the hero would have lost its salt in the plot. , , The creators made the focus of production on entertainment and hugeness. To recreate the fabulous world of magic needed the help of high-tech scene that generated not only different colors, but also landscapes. In addition, were built truly grandiose scenery of the kingdom, including the tower, where was kept Princess Fiona. The height of the individual elements of the tower exceeded 7 meters. As for the costumes â they fully complied with the cartoon. Looking at the main characters, a little nostalgia for 2001 is felt. Characters rarely stayed on stage alone and often took part in massive dance numbers. In the course of the entertaining line, arises interesting fact â a tendency when the villains dance with villains, heroes â with heroes and fantastic creatures â with fantastic creatures. Music in this case is fully consistent with what was happening and emphasized the accordance of a particular character to the forces of good or evil., , Dragon is an element that deserves the particular attention. According to the director, to recreate such a large and complex monster, was spent a huge amount of money for which could be easily build the scenery for any other two performances. The resulting dragon was controlled by three people simultaneously. Every part of its body is mobile and thanks to actor Haven Burton, character could speak. Among other things, the availability of such Dragon shows how great was the desire of the directors to make act as realistic as possible (as for a magical project)."
"358","Side Show ","    Impeccable advantage of this piece is that it is based on a true story that took place in the 1930s. Fiction is a good thing, but it is always interesting to observe the true life of people who, against all odds, managed to succeed in a particular area. In this musical, we are talking about conjoined twins Daisy and Violet Hilton. Starting their artistic career from a low-grade vaudeville, girls managed to get on a serious stage. For long years, they were almost the most popular stars of American pop business., , As planned by Bill Russell, the project supposed to be a play inside the play. It is quite often thing and allows to emphasize the plotâs twists. The musical tells about the artists, most of the scenery made in theater style, the music is fully consistent with the cultural trends of the 30s. Much of the performanceâs success depended on acting of E. Skinner & A. Ripley, who had the honor to bring to the stage The Hilton Sisters. They had to act as a single person, sacrificing personal ambitions. It is logical that one of the actresses could show off acting, and the other could stand out with stronger vocal data. However, this would cause a big contrast and spoil the general idea of the show. Emily & Alice managed to avoid the above-mentioned and on the time of theatricalâs running have become true sisters. The girls have received the only in theatrical history nomination for Best Actress as a duo. , , N. Lewis & J. McCarthy coped well with their roles not worse. Their stage heroes, Terry & Baddy respectively, become the inspirers for twins. They gave them the opportunity to realize their dreams and brought a slice of romanticism in the general line. Overall, the acting is a true biggest item of this production. As for the music, decorations and other â they played a supporting role only, creating a background."
"359","Silence! ","    F. Scheck from âThe New York Postâ said about it the following: âThe breakdown and untidy action that looks much funnier than it should actually beâ. To get pleasure from the view, the beholder must be tuned on the right wave. Creation is definitely not for everyone. In particular, it is absolutely not suitable for the younger generations. The creators deliberately went to such a step, so that in the future not to limit themselves to the amount of used homicide scenes, elements of violence and related black humor. Speaking of the latter: the staging is full with variety of jokes and comical situations, which carry not a good character. Most of them are built by exaggerating the classic moments. For example, the iconic scene in which Hannibal kills cops and leaves, demonstrates that the villain has time to make a sandwich to go from one of the victims. That is why mockery is so popular. The catch is that this genre is not so widespread amongst real theater-lovers. One thing is to show the audience a parody of some fairy tale, and the other â of already terrible story that is backed by mostly black humor. It is possible that in the future this performance will become something like Scary Movie, only for the theater. , , Implementing main heroes, C. Lakin & D. Gaines proved to be surprisingly good. To Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins they are certainly far, but the project had not supposed to have a brilliant acting. What is important â these actors managed to portray characters in a new way. Clarice gained even more frightened outward appearance, which looked particularly good when she was having conversations with Lecter. As for the psychiatrist-cannibal, he is in many ways similar to the original villain. The only difference is that his theatre version throughout the play always had such a look, as if he wanted to eat you. No doubt, all this is to create a comic effect. Musical fully justifies the expectations imposed on it. The most important thing here is to realize that this is not the legendary thriller, but a humorous parody. So the jokes, violence, abusive language will be perceived very differently and may bring pleasure."
"360","Singin' In The Rain ","    Like the classic film of 1952, this musical tells the story of a revolutionary moment in the history of cinema, when the mute picture finally found sound. This event is interesting itself, but the writers have decided not to limit themselves and have elaborated additional storyline circling around the character Don Lockwood. They show the audience the life of a famous silent films actor, his relationships with others, as well as the feelings associated with the advent of sound films. In addition to the Lockwood, show has a lot of interesting characters that have unique life stories. To move written on paper to the stage, were invited only star actors to perform the main roles. Don Correia embodied valiant Don, who before becoming a star passed a difficult and thorny way of provincial musician; Mary D'Arcy revived the image of a strong and at the same time good girl Kathy; Peter Slutsker put on a mask of friendly jovial named Cosmo. But most of all the applause worthy acting job of Faye Grant, who smartly played the role of Lina. Along the way, her character causes a little sympathy from the audience, but at the end, everyone empathize with her. After all, if you think deeper, she is a very talented actress who simply was not ready for such a drastic change in the movie business. , , The scenery here has the second-line role. In most cases, it is made in the form of an arch, a wall or a minimalist version of the film studio. This is done in order not to distract the audience from what is happening on the stage. The creators have repeatedly noted that the basis of their creation in addition to acting is music and choreography. The latter two concepts are closely intertwined: during the entire play, dancing successfully highlighted by the elegant compositions. âGood Morningâ, âBeautiful Girlâ, âYou Are My Lucky Starâ â the lyrics from these songs are familiar to everyone, and we have learned from this musical even how to dance to them right. The real decoration of this theatrical is the episode with the performance of the composition âSingin' in the Rainâ, giving the name to the entire play. In the center of the stage, decorators have put a small pool, the water level in which was only an inch. Fulfilling the dance, the central actors sprayed water, creating the effect of ongoing rain. , , The show is not intended to replace the original film by no means. Rather, it complements it, paying more attention to the consideration of the characters, not forgetting to mention the classic moments. In addition to everything, this musical enables modern look on the most iconic moments in the history of cinema. It was a kind of a war with winners and losers."
"361","Sister Act The Musical ","    Those who say that this item is a simple comedy, seems to have little understanding of the theatrical art at the first place. Of course, the project is considered a worthy representative of the aforementioned genre, but its main task is to demonstrate the ability of each person to change for the better, and show the power of true friendship. Against this background, comedic scenes and jokes fade, but still they very well dilute the atmosphere of particular moments. The spectacular itself begins as a thriller. But along with the progress through the storyline, the situation changes dramatically. The starting point can be considered the moment when the unfortunate singer Deloris enters the monastery. The clash of two cultures & ways of life adds a considerable portion of fun. In the end, the nice and unostentatious morality pops-up on the surface, which will be useful to know., , The creators highly risked, when entrusted the main role to 24-year-old Patina Miller. In her role, she should perform experienced woman, who tried many things in life, both permitted and forbidden. But the actress did not disappoint anyone. Maybe she looks dissimilar to Deloris from the movie, but who said that everyone in the show must comply with the creation of 1992? Despite the small space for creativity, Patina Miller managed to maneuver to present her vision of the famous character. Miss Cartier in her performance turned very energetic and fun (though, we all understand that facial expressions of Whoopi are much more vivid and recognizable and somewhere similar to ALFâs ones). This had a positive impact on the pace of the narration, saving it from long, uninteresting and heartbreaking dialogues between the protagonists. The rest of the performers did well too, but from the beginning, it was clear that the project would revolve around a single character. , , The producers did not spare funds for the scenery. In particular, very well were elaborated elements of the monastery. Numerous statues, paintings â all these were neither just ordinary stickers or plastic products, nor even a papier-mÃ¢chÃ©, but original items, borrowed or bought from a variety of exhibitions. What can we say, even if the balcony, where the choir was located, has been created completely hand-made of wood and delicately processed by craftsmen? All of this was an integral part of incredibly beautiful puzzle called musical. Without them, the effect of acting could be significantly darker., , So this is a thing to demonstrate the true value of friendship and the power of the human volition and nature. Everyone can change himself or herself for the better, if to try hard."
"362","Smash ","    The script of the series was created based on Garson Kaninâs âSmashâ novel. The idea of this project came to Steven Spielberg in 2009. This plan was supported by R. Greenblatt â at that time, the president of Showtime entertainment. Spielberg decided that if he would succeed to create a worthy production in the series, it would also take place at Broadway. Each season meant the development of a new musical. When in 2011 Robert Greenblatt was elected president of NBC Entertainment, he decided to implement the idea of Steven Spielberg. For the production of the pilot series were spent 7.5 million dollars. T. Rebeck worked on the storyline of the first season. It subsequently has been withdrawn from the project., , NBC channel has signed a contract with Columbia Records to create an album with recordings from the first season. It was released in May 2012.

Later, based on this musical about the life of Marilyn Monroe, it is planned to create a full-fledged production. Critics were very favorable when telling of pilot series. They appreciated the originality of the story and musical numbers. Also, reviewers have noted excellent vocal abilities of actors. Subsequent series have not caused such enthusiastic reaction. The second season was weaker than the first part, which affected the interest of the audience. The series has been broadcasted in 31 countries."
"363","Smile ","    The musical is an adaptation of the eponymous film, shot by director M. Ritchie in 1975. H. Ashman did not reflect in his work a satirical line of the narration. In his script, he told the story of what was going on behind the scenes during the beauty contest. It lasted for only six weeks on the stage of Broadway. The show was presented to the audience not in the best time, because that year was marked by the appearance of many great musicals. Against their backdrop, this production remained almost unnoticed by the public. Reviews on the Broadway production were mostly negative. Reviewers noted â musical had lost a satirical mood of the film, and despite all efforts, could not recreate a festive atmosphere of the contest. And yet, a few songs from the show received enough fame among the audience. After the failure, the authors engaged in re-thinking of production. They have created more space for male actors, as well as shifted the emphasis on the other womenâs characters of the play. In the future, this show was staged only using the updated version. , , According to modern critics, the production was one of the most underestimated productions of all times. Musical considered lost, because it was not recorded officially. There exists only a demo version of the Broadway production, prepared for the Samuel French Publishing. When doing it, did not use an orchestra â music created only with the help of several musical instruments. In 2014, the theatrical has been presented in the form of a concerto, which included the actors of the original Broadway production. Critics have pointed out that there was the spirit of youth and beauty. Thanks to programs of revival of lost performances, show received a new life. Its production was started in theatrical schools and colleges, as also a musical allowed to participate in the performance to a large number of girls. Many viewers wondered why this production did not become popular at the first place. According to their opinions, with such melodious numbers and an original storyline, the show had to gain fame. Creation of new performances in the future should definitely allow this histrionics to gain popularity among the modern public."
"364","Smokey Joe's Cafe ","    The legendary duo of two Americans has created in the last century a lot of hits of rock-and-roll and rhythm-and-blues. M. Stoller & J. Leiber with the participation of other authors wrote songs that had become a classic of their genre. That is why the idea to combine music in the general play on the scene did not seem something impossible. Even after five decades after its elaboration, the compositions did not lose fiery rhythm and enthusiasm. Review does not require any plot, as every song is a separate mini-story and is made for pure entertainment., , Two years later, after they met in 1952, Leiber and Stoller wrote a song, which has become their first hit. A few years later, they began to cooperate with Elvis Presley. In 1956, the song in his performance became a large hit. In the future, the authors have created for the legendary singer other several popular works. In total during their activity, M. Stoller and J. Leiber wrote at least 70 hits. This revue includes more than half of these items. The musical composition, after the name of which the show was headlined, included in this theatrical only partially. , , Broadway production has perceived rather negative criticism. And yet, for the duration, this show became the longest amongst revues ever to appear on Broadway. It has lasted on the scene nearly five years. Box office for the weekend at the end of the show amounted to 352,715 dollars, which was lower than planned by the organizers $ 611,820. That is why the show has been closed afterwards. The Broadway production was nominated seven times for Tony and one â for the Outer Critics Circle Aw. In 1996, revue has received Grammy. West End production was nominated for 1 Laurence Olivier., , Unlike the New York revues, not singing actors took part in the London shows, but popular performers. However, critics pointed out that the lack of storyline made the audience bored at the end of the production. Despite the abundance of hits, the genre range of M. Stoller and J. Leiber can be best defined as modest. Consequently, because of this monotony, the audience began to get tired, even listening to very well-known compositions of the past decades. Productions of subsequent years continued to attract the attention of both critics and audiences. In the revue of 2012 participated finalist of musical competition âAmerican Idolâ Melinda Doolittle. There are plans to revive the play on Broadway in 2017."
"365","Snoopy ","    In the productâs heart is a comics of Charles M. Schulz âPeanutsâ, which saw the light in 1950. The premiere of the histrionics is a continuation of the musical âYou're a Good Man, Charlie Brownâ, created in 1967. The show is a container of separate stories that happen with children and puppy beagle. As a result, the histrionics is more like a comic book than play with the consistent storyline. Critics pointed out that the problem of connecting the individual scenes with each other seriously affected the quality of the production. But the musical numbers themselves were found by reviewers very worthy. Because the play is the sequel of another theatrical, it has a line of disadvantages inherent in the stories of this kind. But thanks to the high level of skill of the actors and a good atmosphere in the creative team, creators managed to lower such problems to minimum. , , Correct performance of intelligent and witty works has succeeded not in every performance. Where it happened, the critics and the audience saw the mischievous spirit of cheerful young characters. Beginning to realize the complexity of life, the children continued to perceive the world with an open heart. Little viewers, according to the opinion of their parents, with great astonishment looked at their peers living in a world of romance and friendship. Thanks to this musical, they received an idea of sincere relations existing between the faithful companions. Brought up in the modern satirical animated series children do not immediately begin to perceive light and friendly atmosphere that prevailed in the play. But when they entered into the general mood of the musical characters, then felt wild delight. , , Critics have pointed out that, in spite of the minimal set of scenic elements, production makes very harmonious impression. Unpretentious musical has an irresistible charm of the ordinary comic book. Due to the small number of characters, it has become widespread among school and regional theater companies. The production involves both adults and young actors, with prevalence of latter ones. For the duration of its life, show gets closer to its paper original. These comics have been created for half a century â their latest release came out in 2000. The musical, staged for the first time in 1975, appeared on stage for over 40 years. The history of Snoopy and Peanut Company will be in demand in the audience for a very long time, as moral values, which are described there, are eternal and wit-delivered."
"366","Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs ","    This is a stage adaptation of the Disneyâs animated film Show White of 1937, which was based on a fairy tale by Grimm brothers âSnow Whiteâ. There are also several other productions on the same product (of course â it is a very famous thing). Thanks to work of J. Blackton & J. Cook, engaged in the adaptation of the script and the creation of additional songs, hand-drawn characters have stepped onto real life and sounded lively. This production is one of the first musicals, made after Disneyâs cartoons. The audience appreciated the bold idea of creators. Broadway musical was recorded on video, which made it possible to make acquainted with this show a large number of spectators. Many of them mentioned that they prefer this staging to original cartoon. Thanks to the excellent interaction between M. J. Salerno & R. Bowne, the cast was able to show the real feelings of young lovers who have seen each other only a few times in their lives. The main actress was able to completely transform into a fairy princess: young, naive and trustful. Also, viewers noticed the bright performance of A. Francine & C. Hall, who played the evil queen and the old witch, respectively. , , To create images of gnomes at the request of the director K. Browning were invented and produced special masks made of foam. But as the actors experienced serious difficulties while wearing them, later material has been replaced. The second set of special masks was using terry cloth. Musical compositions of animated film were created during the Great Depression, but this is felt in none of them. Enthusiasm and hard work of gnomes, innocence and friendliness of princess, anger and hatred of the Queen â only because of the songs it was possible to show such a variety of emotions. The animated movie was declared to be a cultural heritage of the American nation, and ranks first in the list of the best pictures of USA."
"367","So Long, 174th Street ","    At the heart of the musical is the work âEnter Laughingâ, written by C. Reiner in 1958. After 5 years, J. Stein created on the basis of this semi-autobiographical novel a theater play, which was later filmed. Production was hosted in Broadwayâs theaters. In 1976, with the assistance of S. Daniels, playwright reworked it into a musical. Although the story had the originality, first Broadwayâs production lasted no more than two weeks from the date of previewsâ finale. The production received very negative reviews. According to critics, the main mistake of the director was poor choice of an actor for the leading role of the theatrical. With all his available talent, 45-year-old R. Morse failed to play the inexperienced Jewish young boy convincingly. After that, the show has been staged extremely rare. After a long period, the production has been revised. Reborn version of the play continued further. , , After the musicalâs redesign in 2007, the show experienced a great success with the public. After receiving a new name, it played with new colors that its creators expected to see 31 years ago. G. S. Irving appeared in the musical in the same role as in the original Broadway production. Despite his old age â he was already more than 85 years â the actor brilliantly coped with his part. The new version of the spectacular has received many positive critical reviews. However, some on them felt that director S. Ross could not completely get rid of the shortcomings of Broadwayâs original version. Despite this, the audience appreciated the musical, which allowed them to laugh almost continuously for 2 hours straight. Farcical storyline enabled the actors to reveal to the public all the facets of their talents. Reviewers underlined J. Grisetti, who played a young man, who sought tirelessly to his dream. According to them, the charm and liveliness of this actor should in the near future bring him on the Broadway stage. Renewed production caught the nice piece of attention, allowing this item to stand sturdy on Broadwayâs scenes."
"368","Something Rotten! ","    The idea of creating such musical appeared at Karey brothers and W. Kirkpatrick in 1990. Teaming up with playwright J. O'Farrell, they created a few songs and sent them in 2010, together with the idea, to a show producer K. McCollum. After C. Nicholaw joined a creative team, production development has been launched. In the show can be seen parody fragments on the most famous Broadway productions, which have been created over the past 50 years. This is the first musical performance presented by brothers Kirkpatrick on Broadway. , , The premiere of the show has caused a great interest among the public. It has received many critical reviews â both positive and negative, but mostly the first ones. Satirical production does not leave anyone indifferent. Reviewers noted a very cheerful atmosphere of the play, which at times was almost out of the permissible limits of decency. The show was filled with puns, a double-meaning dialogues and absurd stylization. During the three summer months of 2015, this theatrical was collecting for 1 week more than 1 million dollars of box office incomes. Over the Christmas holidays, was received not less amount. Despite the fact that this musical has been nominated for a large number of ones, it won only in one category. , , Spectacular and provocative costumes of the Elizabethan era were designed by G. Barnes. Due to attempts to come up with the characters and do a play, on the stage began to appear a lot of details from the performances of the XX century. Creation of a show-in-the-show provided an opportunity to authors to go beyond the 1590s and to show other epochs inside it. Experienced viewers must have paid attention to the fragments of many popular plays, which appeared in the spectacular about the eggs. Critics have noted very harmonious color and light design of the show. The satirical show goes on Broadway for already more than a year, and the public interest to this production has not yet disappeared."
"369","Song & Dance ","    The composer Lloyd Webber described this unusual staging as âa concert for the theaterâ. The first part of the show is an individual musical, the second is a ballet based on a variety of tunes, including âCapriceâ of Niccolo Paganini. Andrew Lloyd Webber was inspired to create a play where he knew about the story of the life of his friend, an Englishman who moved to the USA. Producer Cameron Mackintosh offered to combine musical and ballet in a single production, suitable for display on the big stage. At that time, he worked with the composer on another show. Through this approach, two-act production was created. The first part was devoted to the history of a young English woman, the second through the dance told the story of a young American fellow., , The concert for the theater was staged in London for almost two years. Despite its unusual style, the production was well received by the audience. In 1984, the British show was recorded for BBC television â it involved the wife of the composer, Sarah Brightman. To transfer a concert on Broadway, it was decided to revise the show. A. Lloyd Webber invited Richard Maltby, Jr. to cooperate. After receiving permission of D. Black, director reworked the show and added to it a few songs of his own production. Broadway premiere aroused great interest amongst the audience and critics. Despite the fact that many of the reviewers reacted negatively to the idea of the show, the concert lasted more than a year on Broadway. Critics appreciated the performance of lead actress Bernadette Peters. At the same time, they felt that the story of an Englishwoman was too simple for the Broadway., , Londonâs show was twice nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award. The Broadway production was nominated for the Grammy. It also received three nominations for Drama Desk, where gained 1 victory. Concert was nominated at Tony in eight categories, but receiving only one. The maximum amount of box office for the weekend was received at the beginning of December 1985, amounting to 300,940 dollars. At the end of the show at the Broadway, for the last weekend organizers received $ 151,684. Several of the concert songs became very popular amongst the audience. Recording of West End and of Broadway versions of the histrionics were made later. Despite the negative attitudes of critics to the play, the audience enjoyed the arrangements of A. Lloyd Webber."
"370","Songs For A New World ","    According to J. R. Brown, this production cannot be attributed neither to a musical nor to a revue. It is a theatrical-styled song cycle. Musical numbers included in the show, were created over the years for a variety of different projects. The composer offered Daisy Prince to join the work â daughter of famous producer and director Hal Prince. They examined the available material for three years in a row. Many songs have been weeded out and new songs have been written. The main problem was that the show has not yet had an entrance part. The composer found his inspiration deep in the night, realizing that the songâs concept should be formed around the change of human feelings or the reality around such a person. After completion of the show, its production for the WPA Theater began. , , Thanks to the ideas of group of talented designers, this staging featured original scenography. Separate decorations were prepared for each number. During the song on a ship, from the floor rose up a piece of white cloth, turning into a sail. As soon as it fell down, on the stage behind it, appeared a woman on the cornice of a tall building. Soon, with the help of the same fabrics, the shining city of dreams was shown in the distance. During the song about the war for independence, from the ceiling descended a giant American flag, on creation of which soldier's mother started to work. When the soul of her son was flying away, the Stars-and-Stripes-flag was lifting up. In the music number about the prisoner, the man was in the chair over the glowing grid. In the original histrionics, the final composition was performed by the author, who participated in the show as a pianist., , Critics have called J. R. Brown one of the smartest creators of contemporary Broadway songs. They noted that a show was fun, exciting and completely captivated the attention of the public. Due to the general rhythm, inherent to melodies of J. R. Brown, songs of revue developed in a harmonious narrative line. Musicalâs compositions were written in several genres: pop, gospel, jazz and so on. Because of the small cast and orchestra, this production has become a favorite staging piece shown in small theaters and high schools. Critics noted that the show required actors with great vocal data for the perfect embodying of the storyline."
"371","Sound of Music","    The histrionics is based on the motion picture of 1956 & autobiography of Maria Trapp, who later became a singer. After seeing a motion picture of the West & its continuation about the future of the Austrian family, shot in 1958, music-man V. J. Donehue thought that the role of the main character on a stage would be perfect for his friend Mary. Broadway producer L. Hayward & R. Halliday (husband of Mrs. Martin) agreed with an opinion of the composer. Initially it was planned to create a theatrical production after the film, which would include performance of the songs from the original film. But the project had been revised & the producers decided to make a musical show based on this story with new songs. A duo famous of Broadway authors R. Rodgers & O. Hammerstein II began to compose songs for the production. This musical was their last collaboration. A few months after the premiere of the show on Broadway, O. Hammerstein II died from AIDS. , , Broadwayâs spectacle was differently estimated by critics. Some of them considered this piece too mawkish. Other ones loved the performance very much. The audience enthusiastically took this show. Romantic & lyrical songs that contained in their lyrics not only love, but also humor, fell on the hearts of many people. Mary Martin interacted well with the young participants of the show, perfectly mastering the way of cheerful governess. Broadway production was long â it lasted on the stage for almost 4 years. But the British production was even longer â British audience did not leave their attention to this piece for 6 years. In 1965, the show was filmed. Though by this time the music trends have changed, the audience liked it. The film later entered in the collection of classic American films. The first Broadway production won 5 out of 9 nominations for the Tony Award. It also received an award from the Theatre World & Outer Critics Circle. Versions of other years also were nominated for several rewards. For over half a century, the musical did not descend from the stages of all kinds. Joy & love that sounded in its songs, found an echo in the hearts of contemporary audiences."
"372","South Pacific ","    At the heart of the musical is the novel âTales of the South Pacificâ, written by J. A. Michener. In 1947, this book received a Pulitzer Prize. In 1950, the musicalâs script has also been marked with this award. All stories featured in the original book, are real. During World War II, a university lecturer did not use his immunity and went to serve in the US Navy in the Pacific Ocean. Miraculously surviving after the plane crash, J. A. Michener began to pay more attention to the environment. He began to record the stories of sailors and their personal observations. Later the teacher has created a book based on these records. Hammerstein & Rodgers decided to make a new successful musical, as their previous variant of 1947 has not made much of an impression on the audience. They took from the book of J. A. Michener several stories and adapted them for the stage. The unifying factor was the theme of love and racial prejudice. Rodgers did not want to use ordinary music instruments, which usually appeared in every show about the Pacific Ocean. Writer reassured composer, saying that an empty barrel used as a drum was the only music instrument he had seen during the WWII. Having received lyrics from Hammerstein, Rodgers quickly composed the music â it took no more than 20 minutes to create a song sometimes! , , Revised version made a furor on Broadway. For pre-sale of tickets, organizers have gained 400 000 dollars. Ones, who wanted to see it, stood in long lines to the booths. Because the active tickets speculation, prosecutors of General Office have threatened to close the play. This show has become one of the most famous pieces of work of this creative duo. Critics pointed out that the lack of ballet and the minimum dance numbers in the show gave a special charm to the play. The original Broadway production won in all 10 categories of Tony Award, in which it was nominated. Also, the spectacle has received an award from the New York Drama Critics' Circle. London production in 2001 has been noted with Laurence Olivier Award. The second version of the Broadway show in 2008 received 5 awards out of eight nominations for Drama Desk. Also, play twice had been noted by Theatre World Award and once â by Drama League Aw. The musical received 4 awards out of 8 nominations for the Outer Critics Circle, and 8 awards out of 12 nominations for Tony in 2008. London production in 2011 has been three times nominated for Laurence Olivier. In 1958 and in 2001 were carried out the same-named film adaptations of the musical."
"373","Spamalot ","    Being originally an adaptation of the movie, the musical is completely different. Even though it is a parody on the classical legends about King Arthur, both the audience and the critics liked it. It is proved by the rewards, which has obtained the staging., , The first reward was received thanks to the director â Mike Nichols. He was a famous actor, producer and comedian. All these talents helped him to create a fantastically outstanding show. This man got used to work, combining various genres. And this very spectacle was not an exception. The features of comedy, musical and historic performance made it a unique and funny thing for the Broadway spectators. The viewers start laughing after the first scene, when England is confused with Finland. More than two million people watched the staging. The spectacle collected more than $170 million. These numbers are really striking for the production of such type. , , The decoration design is on the highest level. The crew managed to recreate the necessary atmosphere of the old England. The lighting deserves special attention. Look, for example, how beautiful the scenes in the forest. A technical specialist should be extremely gifted to do such a great job. Pay attention to the acting. The musical is a parody, thatâs why the performers need even more talent to attract the audience and transfer the emotions and feelings, meant by the plot. They also sing and dance wonderfully. Even the secondary dancers, who appear during the scenes with the Lady of the Lake, made their best. All the movements are smooth, and the dancers are carefully trained by the choreographer., , The costume design is magnificent. Mesmerizing suits create the medieval legendary times. Long flaring dresses of women and simple tight outfits of men look impressive. The production in generally is full of song-and-dance extravaganzas. There are plenty of jokes and unusual turns of the storyline. For those, who prefer classical things with no funny or extraordinary features, this performance might seem to be junk. But for people, who like something new, who are ready to laugh and see things from the other side, this musical, which has won three Tonies, will become worthwhile."
"374","Special Victims Unit ","    The show was extremely positively accepted by the critics. As it always happens with creations of Alessandrini, it was called one of the most successful Of-Broadway productions in the history. The public also likes it a lot., , Gerard Alessandrini, who is performing every possible role for his musical creations â author of idea, producer, director, manager, owner, cast-manager, and so forth, â is a well-known American playwright and parodist. In the world of Broadway, he is mostly recognized for this very staging. Long time before he had created this spectacle, he was honored with various awards for his excellence in theatre. The majority of the critics love him. He managed to bring an award to this outstanding Off-Broadway production as well. Alessandrini added all the necessary Broadway details and featured to the staging. Even though it is a parody, it is clever and intelligent one. The spectacle obtained Tony, Obie, Drama Desk, Outer Critics Circle and several other awards., , You will definitely like the musical. It will make you laugh, because the actorsâ play is just magnificent. They have a unique talent in parody. Look, for instance, at the acting of Ron Bohmer and Jason Mills. They managed to make fun out of the trendy and important Broadway culture. The songs are performed here in a way they shouldnât be. And this creates a bigger comic effect for the audience. The voices sometimes are like dying cries, but they are really entertaining. All these sings are not disgusting at all! They are fantastically amusing. , , You will see a parody not only on singing or image, but also on so numerable Broadway addicts. They are showed as narcomaniacs, who keeps looking for a new dose of the show. Despite the general comic nature of the musical, the costumes and dances are wonderful. But, of course, they are funny as well. The performers are quite gifted, and we recognize it from this play. It is the other format of the show than we got used to see. But if you want to spend an interesting evening and get positive emotions together with tremendous mood, you should have spare your time to go on to this piece."
"375","Spider-Man, Turn Off the Dark ","    The basis of the histrionics is the comics of Spider-Man, created by Stan Lee & Steve Ditko & the film of 2002. According to the authors, this show cannot be attributed to the usual spectacle. It contains elements of circus, rock'n'roll motifs, fragments of opera & musical theater. This unusual production required very lengthy preparation & large capital investments, as the technical side of the theatrical was unprecedentedly complex. The show used tricks in the form of flights of the main character & his opponent. During previews some of the actors were even injured, which affected the preparation for the premiere of the show. , , To create this unusual setting, it was spent about USD 75 million. The sets & costumes took nearly USD 10 million in the mentioned amount. Special equipment for flights took USD 2.2 million. Weekly production costs during the show amounted to USD 1.3 million.

In early January 2012, it gathered for a week USD 2,941,794, showing the best result in the history of Broadway. After closure of the show, investorsâ losses estimated to almost USD 60 million. Producers expected to transfer the musical in Las Vegas, but these plans were not realized. Later, the organizers said that the show could be resumed at the end of 2015 or early 2016. They also considered the possibility of establishing a national touring production. But till that time, none of that had happen., , The first reaction to the news of the creation of a musical about Spider-Man was extremely negative. After the premiere, negative reviews became less â opinions were divided in halves. Many critics have written positive reviews about the histrionics. The audience reacted favorably to the play, but organizers expected more interest to their brainchild. Even the re-working of production has not brought the major improvements to the spectacular. But the opportunity to watch live for the beloved heroâs flights was adopted by Spider-Manâs fans with great enthusiasm! Extremely complicated costumes & set design were appreciated not only by the audience â the designers Eiko Ishioka & George Tsypin have received awards for their work. The show entered in Broadwayâs history, as the production, which has shown the best result for the weekly collections in the box office & at the same time, ended as unprofitable."
"376","Spring Awakening ","    This rock musical is based on the eponymous German play written by playwright-expressionist F. Wedekind in 1891. Theater production was banned in many countries because of its provocative plot and content. In the XIX century, it was considered inappropriate to speak of issues related to adolescentsâ maturation, violence, abortion, non-traditional intercourse relations and suicides.

Also, the show has gained 2 victories out of 6 nominations for Lucille Lortel Award. The London production won 4 out of 7 categories at the Laurence Olivier Aw. The updated version of the Broadway received 15 nominations for the Ovation Awards, winning 6. Also, it was twice nominated for the Astaire Award, and won three out of four Tonies and Drama Desks., , Songs do not disclose the plot of a show. They only allow the characters to express their current emotional state. Confusion and excitement associated with the first intimate experience, the tragic consequences of such a step, despair and hopelessness â all these creators of the performance have brought to the audience by means of finely and subtly selected music. Many critics have pointed out that the new rock musical brought to the Broadwayâs stage a fresh stream. The performance was markedly different from the likes for its originality and dramatic story. Staging showed not only bigotry and hypocrisy of the adult world, but also the vulnerability of impulsive teenagers."
"377","Star Is Born","    According to many critics, the picture in 1954 is one of the best music films ever produced in Hollywood. For her role in the film, Judy Garland has been nominated for Oscar. When this award came to Grace Kelly, the majority of the audience considered this choice wrong. The picture has not received a single Oscar, although has been nominated in six categories. But both leading artists won the Golden Globe Award. Director G. Cukor was invited to become the director of this film in 1937, but he refused then. According to the filmmaker, its plot was too similar to his other picture. When 15 years later on the same subject he was approached by S. Luft, G. Cukor agreed to take the director's chair. The film was the first color film in his career. , , The drama reveals the mystery of the relationship between Hollywood filmmakers and actors, as well as personal life and the problems associated with excessive popularity of superstars. The film shows the sincere feelings and sacrifice of the man in the name of a person dear to him. Many Hollywood actors experienced the problem of alcoholism. Revealing the ugly inside story to the audience, the authors have shown a number of situations constantly arising in a real cinematic environment. The American public appreciated the work of the creators very highly, although in the box office film was almost unprofitable. , , This is also was the last work of Judy Garland â in the future, she was no longer proposed to star in movies. Drug-addicted actress died of an overdose in 1969. At the funeral, James Mason â her co-star in 1954 â made a last speech. Their roles almost like in mirror reflected in reality. The famous actress was unable to cope with huge popularity, ruining her life and career. Musical drama entered the American Heritage Foundation â it was officially deposited in the Library of Congress. Songs from the movie entered the ten best numbers ever created for the movies."
"378","Starlight Express ","    Re-considered Cinderellaâs story found an unusual expression in the form of locomotives and mowing railway vehicles. In the plot, a fairy godmother has been replaced by God of Trains â Starlight Express. In the rock musical, all the actors implemented act on the roller skates. Before begin to study their parts, each participant had to undergo four-month training on roller skates. For the first performance, they had to completely rebuild the London theater. On the Apollo Victoria Theatreâs stage has been equipped a real roller skating race track in several tiers â they even arranged the skate roads in the beholderâs hall. Those who managed to pass a casting on vocals, supposed to dance confidently on roller skates., , Slogans of rock show were âExtreme to the fullestâ and âThe fastest musical in the universeâ that totally justifies the essence of what is happening on the stage. Additions over time to the script only brought entertainment to project, simplifying the complicated plot twists and giving more logic to everything what was going on. Due to the presence of characters onstage in the form of trains from different countries, specially rearranged scaffolding for skaters, allusions to active performers to famous rock idols â Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, AC/DC â and their recognition from the scene, a beautiful work of decorators, designers and costumers â the project has gained world fame and love. Each hero had his remarkable style of dance and a special set of movements. This ensured recognizability to everyone and everything., , Since Andrew Lloyd Webber was the original generator of ideas about the show of electric locomotives, he made easily any changes o libretto. Writer initially overcame a possible similarity with his other projects, for example, âCatsâ. In addition to that, it was not the only show where the characters ride on roller skates. In the Broadway version of âThe Little Mermaidâ, residents also moved on them, revealing the depths of the sea. However, they didnât have built rollerdromes, neither specially erected buildings for their spectacle. The greatest recognition in Germany can be attributed to a special personal touch to the staging. After all, this rock musical has its own building in Bochum, where performance still lives. Choreographer Arlene Phillips from London productions even created for fans of the show a special school dance on roller skates."
"379","State Fair ","    This theatrical is based on the novel by P. Stong, written in 1932. Staging is also an adaptation of the eponymous musical film of 1945. This is the only motion picture for which O. Hammerstein and R. Rodgers wrote songs specially. For one song, they even received an Academy Award. 24 years after the appearance of the film, it was decided to carry out a musical production. Critics pointed out that the seemingly banal show successfully passed most of the traps in the form of triviality and sentimentality. This was mainly due to the witty script of L. Mattioli & T. Briggs. All the characters were shown positive and bright people. Despite the fact that the events took place in rural areas, the production avoided caricatures on provincial hinterland. Funny dialogues are full of folksy charm. Rural idealism in the face of the main characters meets and defeats urban cynicism, while showing that the true feelings are an important fundamental principle for the well-being of each person., , After the premiere, Broadway production received various criticisms. Some reviewers felt the show too cloying and outdated. Its role played the big stage, where production took place. Plays, previously presented in small theaters, received very good reviews. Critics noted that the atmosphere of the show is inversely proportional to the size of the stage, on which it was â the smaller the better for production. In 1996, the show has received 2 awards from New York People's Choice. Broadway production has been nominated for the Drama League and Outer Critics Circle rewards. Histrionics was twice nominated for Tony and three times for Drama Desk. Despite the fact that the critics considered this play not the best production, created by O. Hammerstein & R. Rodgers, the audience enjoyed the show a lot. Songs written by famous Broadway duet over half a century ago have not lost their fruitiness even today. They still are liked by many people."
"380","Steel Pier ","    Many people thought that the idea to create a musical about a dance marathon in the US during the Great Depression should not end in failure. With a very strong cast and talented choreographer, this staging had a very good chance of becoming the new Broadway hit. The plot of a show though looked like a film âThey Shoot Horses Donât Theyâ, but it was an original brainchild of David Thompson. Despite the high quality of the performance, the theatrical did not spend much time on Broadway. Production originally was not too lucky â the day before its premiere, it was a first day of another show, proved to be very popular amongst theatrical audience. âTitanicâ took several prizes, on which this piece about a dance marathon also was nominated. , , Broadway production received mixed reviews. Critics noted upscale choreography and melodious musical numbers. At the same time, according to the reviewers, the musical clearly had not enough energy. The exhibition of marathon was stretched â it wasnât even saved by a variety of dances, set by great Susan Stroman. Active development of the plot began only in the second act of the play. Critics have pointed out that if the musical premiered in the XXI century, it would go through more success. Modern audiences got used to watch the reality shows aimed on survival, therefore, the staging about such marathon would certainly find its audience. , , Broadway performance never could not collect planned cash box office of USD 669,064. The best result the organizers received in the middle of May 1997. Then the box office for the weekend amounted to 460,186 dollars. When closing the play, for the last weekend were generated only USD 388 037. The musical received 11 Tony nominations, 10 nominations for Drama Desk and 1 nomination for the Drama League. The theatrical was awarded with only two awards from the Theatre World. Also staging won in 1 out of 10 nominated categories in Outer Critics Circle. If at that time this particular musical didnât have a serious competitor, it possibly would have received more awards and attention from the public."
"381","Story of My Life","    The authors of this work began working on Manhattan since 2001. Canadians participated in theater festivals, and attracted a lot of attention to their works. Once upon a time, their songs heard M. Bush of the Manhattan Theater Club. He was impregnated with an idea to try to make songs for this musical. When a Canadian company offered to produce works written by N. Bartram and B. Hill, director joined to their creation. The first show was in Toronto. Critics pointed out that the authors were able to present song goodly as well as some scenes of the play, but they still had to work on the overall production. Broadway version was established a little more than two years after the world premiere of the musical., , The history of life and friendship between the two men failed to bring to New York audiences. The show was closed after only 5 regular performances. Production received many negative reviews, though some critics have pointed out that the show was delicate and lyrical. Reviewers have noticed â the musical seemed very sincere, but the atmosphere could easily disappear in the big Broadway stage. The play received 4 nominations for Drama Desk and didnât win anything else. In addition to the US, productions were also made in Belgium, Danish, South Korea, Germany and Austria., , Actors of Broadway show pointed out that the musical has forced them to take a fresh look at their own lives and personal relationships with close people. After watching the show, many viewers began to restore ties with their old comrades. The story of difficult relations between friends â from the strong childhood friendship to its strong cooling in adulthood â shows how complex the fate of creative people can be. Everyone should be aware that every word can affect the life of a comrade. This understanding came to the protagonists too late."
"382","Subways Are for Sleeping ","    The musical is based on an article in âHarper's Magazineâ in 1956, telling the story of homeless people sleeping in the subway, and a book written by Edmund G. Love in 1957. The author of a book himself went through life in subway cars in the 1950s. Several years later, A. Green & B. Comden created a new story based on this musical. Despite the fact that the music for the staging written by famous composer Jule Styne, the show has not received the recognition on Broadway. When D. Merrick realized the plight of the musical, he decided on a very risky step. The producer found the people whose names were identical with the names of well-known New York critics, and invited them to watch performances. Treating them with dinner afterwards, D. Merrick asked for permission to use their names in advertising the show. After reception of written consent, he prepared an article about the musical with laudatory opinions on behalf of these people. When the advertisement was sent to the newspapers, only one editor became suspicious. His was confused by the picture of a black man â he knew exactly that this critic with that name was white. Calling to other publishers, the editor managed to stop the going out of advertising. Only early paper âNew York Herald Tribuneâ came out with good reviews from alleged critics. But it was enough for this spectacular to stay afloat on Broadway for almost six months. Subsequently the show was criticized by real reviewers. Several years later, Phyllis Newman recalled that regional shows were much better than the Broadway show., , The idea to replace the opinions of critics with reviews from ordinary people with the same names appeared in David Merrick a long time ago. He was stopped by only one thing â he could not find a person with the name of the oldest Broadway reviewer. When Brooks Atkinson retired, the producer decided to realize his idea. When he learned that the subway and bus companies have refused to place ads for a show, fearing of an influx of homeless people, D. Merrick wanted to help the musical. Because of his unusual idea, the theatrical even received several nominations for the Tony Award. One went to Phyllis Newman, perhaps not least because of her attire â the actress in most of her scenes was dressed only in a towel. The new production has been carried out many years later. Musical entered in Broadway history, as no one before tried to manipulate the opinions of the unaware readers. Subsequently D. Merrick became the producer of many popular musicals."
"383","Sugar ","    The musical is an adaptation of the famous American film of 1959 âSome Like It Hotâ with inimitable Mrs. Monroe. The original picture was loosely based on the French film of 1936 âFanfares of Loveâ and its German remake of 1951 and the second German remake of 1953. The film became a legendary milestone in the American film industry. With great difficulty, breaking through the barriers of ethical committees and lots of hesitations and various obstacles, the film has reached the cinemas screens. The participation of talented actors and unconventional plot ensured the success of this comic movie. After 13 years after the creation of the film, it was adapted as a musical spectacular. According to critics, the show was the weakest performance of composer J. Styne. Production lasted on the stage mainly due to the excellent acting of Broadwayâs veterans â R. Morse & C. Ritchard, as well as not boring plot of the original motion picture. After the closure, this histrionics was quickly forgotten. The only song that became known gave its name to the play., , After 19 years from Broadwayâs show closure, British producers have decided to make a new version of it. They used the name of the original picture to attract more attention to their brainchild. In an attempt to revive public interest in the performance, in 2002 began the North American national tour. The main star of the production was the 77-year-old Tony Curtis, who played there a role of Osgood Fielding, Jr. According to critics, even a weak voice of actor who expounded his text intoned, did not prevent him to realize a bright image of the old lecher on the stage. This was the main difference from the original movie, where a fan of Daphne was shown just as the elderly eccentric ladies-lover. All the attention audience gave to Mr. Curtis, not noticing the good work of his partners in musical. Nevertheless, Arthur Hanket and Timothy Gulan managed to get used to the unusual images of runaway musicians, showing the maximum of their comedic talents. Jodi Carmeli perfectly embodied the image of Sugar. The only problem was that the singer had the voice of a Broadway diva, which was not consistent with the original vocal data of Marilyn Monroe. , , Another reworked version was set in 2010 in Elmsford, New York, USA. Upgrade of the performance was the fact that the producers decided to show through a musical a set of the film âSome Like It Hotâ. Enough interesting idea could not successfully embody on stage and it hasnât add life to the production. Reducing the duration of dance numbers also played a negative role. According to critics, directors have paid too much attention to recreation the atmosphere of shooting a movie, forgetting that they were doing a musical show. "
"384","Summer of '42 ","    This theatrical is an adaptation of the eponymous film of 1971 and the autobiographical novel by Herman Raucher. Despite the success of the film, a musical based on it was created only 30 years later. In 1998, actor Hunter Foster went to producer D. Kirshenbaum and asked him to perform the adaptation of the film. The composer agreed to take part in it, but if he would receive permission from the owners of the rights to the film and the novel. Foster's and Raucherâs lawyers within a month agreed to provide authority for the implementation of the script adaptation. The world premiere of the show took place in 2 years after the first step in the creation. The author of a book was present at the New Yorkâs show in 2001. H. Raucher was very happy that someone decided to make a musical production based on his brainchild. Organizers of the show offered a discount on tickets to the Second World War participants and their families, as well as ex-military men. On the imminent closure of the production affected the situation prevailing after the terrorist attacks of September 11th. The performance received good reviews from critics, but it did not help it to get to Broadway. In the future, production entered in the repertoire of the studentâ and small theaters of the USA. The musical introduced a new generation of young Americans with a book and a film of 1971. The show was released on DVD and novel was reissued. They started to distribute them across the Internet. , , Many theater critics regretted that the show has entered the stage in a very unfortunate time, and noticed the quality of performances, despite the absence of famous stars in production. In the opinion of those reviewers, the authors have managed to create a unique musical about the problems faced by young adolescents, based on the novel. The theatrical show had three different characters: timid Benjie, discreet Hermie and cheeky Oscy. Despite the general interest to the taboo topic, each of them managed to reveal themselves differently. Benjie was closest to platonic relationship with the opposite sex. Hermie fell in love with a married woman older than he is at seven years. Oscy sought to fast sex with peers, without any obligation. The trio of girls â friends of the main characters â often acted as a Greek chorus commenting the plot that surely added humor to the story. The transition to the drama takes place towards the end of play, when a teenager begins to notice the loneliness of a young soldier's wife. Ryan Driscoll could easily pass youthful uncertainty of his character, as for an actor it was the debut role on the stage. Before that, 16-year-old man worked as a janitor in the Goodspeed Opera House. Teacher of vocal sent him to casting hearing that around there was an audition at new production. Continuing to go to school, the boy got the lead role in this play. Later critics regretted that upfront the future New Yorkâs show, many participants matured and lost their teenage charm."
"385","Summer Stock ","    A truly fun and enjoyable film, the main feature of which is inimitable Gene Kelly. His ability to deftly move on the stage, to dance fiery and furiously, and to act like he did, is a matter of envy. Many complain that the extra weight of the main actress was truly noticeable. Of course, it was â she was at drugs that time, people! While the rest of the girls from the farm troupe of wandering actors were dressed in elegant suits, gown of Judy Garland looked untidy, as if it was stuck in a sewing machine, and no one really bothered to complete it. But, you know, paying attention to such small items is pretty boring. The actress has done well with her role, despite the fact that her health was not in order. She danced easily and looked fresh (and this, incidentally, was very difficult for her, given that the woman was very exhausted during the filming). , , Generally, Judy Garland and Gene Kelly was an amazing Hollywood couple. They made a musical film unique, sweet and tasty. Background looks rather a little weak (the field, a barn, a tractor), but the music part covers this deficiency with excess. And the song âGet Happyâ not for nothing had become one of the well-known songs released on thousands of plates., , By the way, the film influenced the pop culture. So, Michael Jackson at the American Music Awards (1993) and the MTV Video Music Awards (1995) performed his famous song ""Dangerous"" in the style of this film. He and his backing dancers were dressed in the same costumes that the actors of the musical, and some excerpts from âGet Happyâ he happily played on his concerts. Also, actress Katie Holmes paid tribute to Judy Garland, performing famous âGet Happyâ on the television show âSo You Think You Can Danceâ. She was dressed in a similar outfit as the main character of the musical. , , Sadly, the musical Summer Stock was the final one for Judy Garland, but it was good that an actress at least completed her career on uplifted note."
"386","Sunday in the Park With George ","    This musical is for those who like something deeper. If you prefer a superficial literature, cinema, where there is no need to ponder to understand what is happening, you are simply wasting your time., , Even the history of the musical, not to mention the fact of the play itself, is very interesting. The creators have been searching for the story to their future brainchild for a quite long time. They looked at the pictures and small sketches for weeks, trying to find something unusual. And one evening they gazed at the picture of the artist Seurat âSunday in the Park With Georgeâ. The same highlighted salt of which they were so desperately looking for, had finally been found. On the canvas in the style of pointillism (neoimpressionism direction in which the basis is work made by separate strokes of brush), which depicted the shore, with lots of people gathered, and they all were looking into the distance. The creators wanted this picture was represented through the prism of one man â the artist. And they decided to recreate on stage the story of this picture, through the story of the artist who made it. , , This approach seemed intriguing, and the fact that in 1985 this histrionics won the Pulitzer Prize (this not often happen to musicals), deserves special attention. In the 90-ies, the musical has not received such publicity, as in the 2000s. In many ways, the latest technology contributed to the success â the amazing animation, which was taken with enthusiasm by the audience and the critics., , Sitting in the audience, you empathize the main character â an artist, for whom art was the only life goal. He truly loved his wife, but with a special love, different from love to artistry. This love was not enough for her, in any case, because she understood that she was not at the first place for him, but the art was. And it was tough for this woman. It is difficult to tell whether the art was the truly goal and the aim for this master, or an instrument to achieve fame and recognition, or he simply wanted to enter the history. Whatever it was, the heroine choose a completely different way â she pushed memories aside, gave birth to child and left the painter, leaving to other man."
"387","Sunset Boulevard ","    A musical based on the movie of the same name in 1950 was originally conceived more optimistic: the protagonist let go of her lover to another woman. However, a planned one has never been realized. The directors have decided not to throw out such an emotional finale, and, we must say, did rightly so, because such moments make the audience experience shock, and isnât it the main purpose of any theatrical?! , , Hollywood is like an oasis in the desert â attracts sufferings to quench their thirst. Suffering and seeking recognition young man had experienced a heavy fate, as he had not become a popular writer. His work is not interesting to film companies, and in addition, all his property is mortgaged. He is also pursued by the agents of collection service and eventually he falls into a stone monastery of once popular actress. She still considers herself popular, though havenât been filming for over 10 years. , , Everything oppresses in her house: dullness, graynessâ¦ From the former luxury and popularity not even a hint left, because the viewer's love is so fleeting. But the faithful butler-driver does not allow the truth to be revealed. Protecting the woman, he secretly writes letters to her, which she reveals as those received from fans. , , Can you empathize to the main hero, is hard to say. Some might call him a spineless opportunist. And perhaps it is. In fact, he agrees to dine, sleep and live under the roof of his new acquaintance, in fine conditions of some sort of confinement. Someone can exclaim: âHow can it be confinement? He worked on her script. So this must be mutually beneficial business relationship!â. But the truth is that the script was worth nothing; it was so hideous that the only salvation was to rewrite it completely. So that kind of life and a relationship he found acceptable., , This is how the main characters have chosen the path of self-deception: she did not want to accept the reality that her brilliant career was over now, and he did not want to think that unwittingly became a gigolo, staying at the pay of an aging lady., , But amongst this black-and-gray palette there was a bright ray â young worker of the studio that fascinated writer. And the story could have ended on a positive note, if not fatal failure on the scenario of the main character. In fact, without even knowing it, this girl sent him to the monastery of once famous actress. , , It seems like this story could have no alternative conclusion. Screenwriter was weak and actress fixated on herself and believed that she could re-born like the Phoenix from an ashes. But fate decreed otherwise. Perhaps, this musical is instruction for the young generation? No need to deceive oneself â the glory is not eternal, and even the famous people are forgotten., , In any case, a musical deserves the audienceâs attention. It is dynamic and twisted, and the music perfectly complements the action."
"388","Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street ","    Thoroughly revised by the authors-creators urban legend from the category of stories about Jack the Ripper has acquired a completely different sound on the stage. A transcription of a serious play in the musical did not make its content more superficial as it might seem at first. Many awards prove that even quite cruel and bloody horror, accompanied by musical themes, having a strong story-basis and not deprived of deep morality, can be worthy of the highest praises and hot spectator interest in the qualitative and serious approach to the play. , , Interestingly that for the transposition of the play into a musical it did not require too much money. The cost of staging paid off soon after the product arrived to be shown to the audience. The gloomy entourage of the London streets in the midst of the XIX and the availability of conversational cues do âSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Streetâ more like a serious drama performance, and even more â as a real opera production. Stephen Sondheim called his creation âgloomy operettaâ. The structure of the play and the music is not too exemplified in intricacy, but by themes of love and revenge, it was very similar to the operetta genre. Serious detective-thriller line separates it from the concept of the operetta itself, and rivers of blood with the presence of many corpses turn it into a real horror show. Thus, this theatrical has become the bloodiest in the history of this genre. , , So this is a serious dramatic work, forcing the audience to think about the nature of irrationality of evil. Once stepped on the path of revenge, it is impossible to find peace. It is about what a person can do and ready for to silence the voices of own conscience. , , The histrionics does not contain any sentimental consolation. The viewer is not given hope of justice in the world. Authorities are despotic, ordinary people have no rights. Devil's forces almost omnipotent. And that is why it is so important not to give them a place in your heart. , , It is amusing that a whole story is based on real events! And the fact that it is quite moralistic due to successful transposition on the script, makes it truly worthy product among the world's best musicals. End of story has a visual reference to the iconography of the lamentation of Christ. , , Of course, this product is not suitable for young beholders. And even less it is for those who have decided to amuse oneself. But for those who used to think of the musical genre as of not too serious, pure entertainment â they are awaited by change of their beliefs. In the play, there is something to think about, and after watching, it leaves a long and viscous aftertaste, making us yet again to go back to the sad story of a barber from Flint Street, Sweeney Todd."
"389","Sweet Charity ","    The musical is based on the Italian-French film âNights of Cabiriaâ, filmed in 1957. The scenario was written by great F. Fellini. The production was one of the first works of Robert Louis (Bob) Fosse as a director and choreographer. How his wife, Gwen Verdon, told, they accidentally saw this Italian film. The picture has made an indelible impression on Bob Fosse â he could not even sleep that night. Early in the morning, the man woke up his wife and showed the outline of a script for a new musical. Became famous in the mid-1960s, Fosse could already make productions according to his taste. He bought out the rights from F. Fellini to make it a libretto for the play for 25 000 dollars and invited Neil Simon for cooperation. Subsequently, the director did not mention his name as a librettist in this theatrical., , Fosse met many dancers for a fee, so he decided to change a profession of the protagonist. Through this experience, the choreographer wanted to create a number, where the women lined up trying to attract the attention of men, so they hired them as partners for the dance. The implication was that many of them would be able to continue communication with own customers on a more intimate level. The music for the show has been done in the style of vulgar jazz, performed in cabaret. Dance performances were deliberately grotesque. The main character played by Gwen Verdon. Premiered on Broadway, it has caused a major stir, since the musical was markedly different from counterparts across the country. After this show, Bob Fosse has received fame as a provocative creator. , , Because of its unusual style, the theatrical received only one award from the Tony, although it was nominated in 9 categories. And yet, Mr. Fosseâs victory as a choreographer has become a landmark. He competed in this category with the legendary Jack Cole, founder of jazz dance. Gwen Verdon received an award from the Outer Critics Circle. After the furor of the Broadway show, it was decided to film it in Hollywood. Producers confirmed Shirley MacLaine for the lead role. The actress said that she would shoot only if the director would be Bob Fosse. Since producers required to make a film in Hollywood-style, the picture failed at the box office. But thanks to the innovation of director in the movie, a new style of dance numbers has appeared. Subsequently, based on it, video-clips began to be shoot like this. , , The second Broadway production also realized Bob Fosse. During rehearsals of the musical, he died at the hands of Gwen Verdon, who was the second director of the show. Performance has been 5 times nominated for the Drama Desk, receiving 1. Also, the play won 4 wins out of 5 categories at Tony. Musical was noted by Outer Critics Circle and Theatre World. The third Broadway production was 3 times nominated for Tony and four â on the Outer Critics Circle. This show also won 1 from Theatre World and 1 from Drama Desk. There are about 10 versions of this histrionics, staged in different parts of the world."
"390","Swing! ","    An energetic mix of music and dance has been embodied in the revue created by P. Kelly, based on famous works of the swing-music era. Appearing during the Great American Depression in the Harlem neighborhood, this genre reached its highest dawn in the period from the mid-1930s to mid-1940s of XX century. At the time, Fats Waller gave such definition to swing: âit at two-thirds consists of rhythm and at one-third â of the movements of the soulâ. Bright, fast-paced and catchy melodies have become the basis for creating a variety of musical styles and future genres. At the end of the 1990s, there was a resurgence of interest of listeners to this genre and its modern incarnation in the form of neo-swing. Broadway production presented to the public the new version of the famous songs that have already become classic. Spectators were able not only to hear, but to see a swing in the performance of professional modern dancers. Arrangers very carefully approached the processing of music, being able to save in them initially available vim, energy and passion. Thanks to the ideas of the designer William Ivey Long, stylized costumes helped the actors to get viewers back to half a century ago, immersing them in bright colors and unrestrained emotions prevailing in the 30s, 40s and even partly â in 50s., , Broadway show has attracted great interest of the public. Critics appreciated dance revue well, giving it a lot of positive feedback. The audience left the theater delighted, immediately trying to buy CD-album with songs sounded in the show. Made in January 2000, recording with the participation of the actors from Broadway set later was nominated for Grammy. The play was also noted by the attention of many awards. Show 6 times has been nominated for Tony, twice â on the Outer Critics Circle Award. Revue three times was nominated for the Drama Desk, received 2 awards from the Theatre World and 1 nomination from Drama League. Maximum box office for the weekend was obtained at the end of December 2000, amounted to 581,618 dollars. During the final week of the show, organizers have gained for tickets $ 458,613. After the Broadway production has been completed, the revue has gone to a great tour across the country. Many older Americans, catching the birth of swing, attended the show. They pointed out the correct settingâs atmosphere, which has absorbed the spirit of the famous 60 years-old songs. Paul Kellyâs experience has shown that in the past there are a lot of bright, energetic and positive melodies that can deliver a great pleasure even now."
"391","Taboo ","    This spectacular shows the era of the New Romantics. This movement arose in opposition to the culture of punks and new wave. Boy George was a brilliant representative of the club movement. All the action is steeped in the atmosphere of this sub-culture that spawned the grotesque and striking forms. , , The young man, who came from the province, is naturally attracted to such a full-life experience. Life, which has one goal â is to enjoy everything and all the time. Hedonism was the main motto of the new romanticism. The musical concludes constantly visible conflict â between traditional family values and gender relations, as a mom and a friend of the protagonist â on the one hand, and the world of androgens, where the concept of gender is blurred and the traditional attitude to males is scornful and condescending â on the other. , , Who will be interested in this histrionics? Perhaps, young people, leading the club lifestyle. People who are addicted to the 1980s music in the style of Nu-Ro, and for whom the names of such bands as Duran Duran, Culture Club, Blitz Kids are not an empty sound. For lovers of bright shows, music, gorgeous costumes, acting â it definitely worth a look. Even without knowing the language, after reading the libretto, you would be interested â actors intelligibly convey the emotions of their characters. And of course, fans of Luke Evans must see him still quite young, in one of his first acting jobs. Quite good vocals, sensual acting â all gives out a future celebrity in him in this piece. , , The musical constantly promotes the idea of dissimilarity to other people. At the end, there are words that life is a struggle, but that does not mean you have to be rivals with everyone all the time. Better to be lovers. Everyone is free to understand this idea as he pleases. The spectacular had good reviews in the British press and the high level of the cast. It does not have some sharp social orientation, but has the festive atmosphere and nice music. Who cares about creativity of Boy George â one will hear the new songs written specifically for this musical., , And although the whole musicalâs atmosphere is saturated with Nu-Ro and the characters live bright and fun, after watching, it feels a little sad. There is no sense that the characters dressed in futuristic attires, living only for themselves, are in contrast to the way of life of other happy people. Their living, after all, is not better than one of the others."
"392","Take Flight ","    At the heart of the musical are real stories of the pioneers of aviation, who made their exploits in the beginning of the era of regular use of aircrafts. As the authors of the production originated from USA, they took fates of legendary American pilots to tell them from the stage. Three stories were divided into pieces and fragmentary presented to the beholders. Mosaic, composed of different years and destinies, devoted to one â passionate desire to climb onto the sky to enjoy unrestrained flight in a blue vastness. Music by David Shire managed to convey an airy oceanâs depth and ease of soaring on airplane under the guidance of the pilot. Staging includes three different stories: about tight-knit brothers, seeking to overcome the force of gravity; about the aviator-loner, opposed to the rest of the world; and about a woman who did not want to stay within specified by the men of her family limits. Comedy scenes with elements of conversations by Wilbur and Orville Wright were delightfully conveyed by duo of S. Kenyon & E. Levey. According to many critics, it is this part of the musical the liveliest and most interesting. In the melodies that sound during the heroic mission of Charles Lindbergh, you can hear the fatigue and exhaustion that have captivated a pilot due to long non-stop transatlantic flight. In life, Amelia Earhart tried to make a choice between the passion for the sky and the love to her husband. But nothing could stand on the way of implementation of desire of woman to fly in the air vastness. S. A. Triplett managed to convey to the public the uncontrollable desire that was burning in a heart of a brave heroine. , , The musical received various reviews. According to critics, production remained to dwell on the land, although it tried to climb into the sky. Despite the experience of the founders, the production got somehow ragged â disparate fragments of the fates of airmen failed to be tied together on the stage. Some reviewers complained about the fact that, in spite of overall good-quality music, the show did not have a single song hit. They also noted the lack of dramatic effect of the plot. Romance between Amelia Earhart and George Putnam seemed to many too cloying and distracting from the overall context of the play. Some critics perceived the show as a history lesson, conducted with the use of music. Despite the existence of such shortcomings, the musical has found its audience. The staging was especially loved by those who obtained flying license and knew everything about the skies. The audience reacted well to the performance, as the story about pilots is quite rare for a music shows (well, there are maybe 1 or 2 other shows about pilots in the history of Broadway and thatâs it). Despite the fact that since the inception of the aircraft mastery, a long time has passed, people should not forget about the origins of the thing that is now perceived as something very usual. Thanks to this spectacular, audience will be able to recall well-known facts of history and even to meet them for the first time."
"393","Take Me Along ","    The musical is an adaptation of the play âOh, Wildernessâ, created by E. O'Neill in 1933. Typically, the playwright wrote about his past with anger, but this time he looked back with nostalgia, calling this work âa comedy of memoriesâ. The idea to make of this play a musical came to the producer D. Merrick in 1955. But because of death of the poet and librettist J. L. Touche, creation of theatrical has been postponed. A few years later D. Merrick decided to go back to the development of â¦Wilderness. In 1957, he made a proposal to address this production to the composer B. Merrill, who made another musical adaptation of the O'Neillâs play. , , The premiere of the Broadway production showed a significant public interest in this spectacular. Although the show could not be attributed to the commercially successful projects, it lasted on the stage for more than a year. Much of the credit for 10 nominations of musical at Tony award belongs to the star composition of the first Broadway production. J. Gleason & W. Pidgeon, as well as young R. Morse, brilliantly revealed their characters. All three received nominations for Tony, but only the first actor managed to win the reward. The second Broadway production was totally unsuccessful. The stagings passed in regional theaters suffice successfully, but production came to Broadway with a large underfunding. Hopes of organizers to receive financial support did not materialize, and the musical closed immediately after its premiere. , , Critical responses to the second Broadway production were very different. Many reviewers have pointed out that the musical sounded too clumsy for a modern audience. Also was noted too cloying chorus performance in the absence of sunny mood. According to critics, the main mistake was that in the cast of the musical were not involved any brightest stars of Broadway. Producer of the first Broadway production took into account the fact that the show could become a disaster without the participation of famous stars, but the organizers of the second production did not think about this possibility seriously., , The production of 2008 in the Irish Repertory Theater deserves particular attention. Director C. Moore faded the role of Sid Davis, which allowed the rest of the characters in the play to show themselves very clearly and energetically. Acting of B. Glover forced to re-evaluate her character Lily. Warm and gentle attitude of woman expressed to scampish beloved perfectly conveyed in the clear voice of an actress. Thanks to chamber hall of the theater, theatrical has acquired a provincial charm, present only in small towns. Story of an ordinary American family life can seem overly moralistic, but it is clear that the characters truly worry about each other, referring to the family with great portion of love and care. These values are in demand with the audience at any time, so the musical would find its audience in the XXI century."
"394","Tale of Two Cities","    The musical is an adaptation of the novel by Charles Dickens, written in 1859. The book is part of a number of works obligatory for studying in American schools. There were made other attempts to adapt the novel, but no version has become yet successful. J. Santoriello was impressed by this book as a teenager. Being a self-taught musician, the author wrote the songs, without thinking that later she would have to become a librettist in this production. The histrionics was a finalist of Eugene O'Neill Center Musical Theatre Workshop. The first songs were presented in a concert held in Indianapolis, with a symphony orchestra and a large choir. The show has received grants from the states of New Jersey and Florida, becoming a finalist in the future Los Angeles International Musical Theater Competition., , Creation of production was not easy. Director D. H. Bell left the project due to personal problems before the pre-Broadway try-outs begin. In 2006, he was replaced by M. D. Edwards. Based on the work of his predecessor, W. Carlyle made Broadway production come to life. After three days from the premiere on Broadway, a collapse on stock markets began in the world. What was happening, made a hard hit on various shows, but the musical of J. Santoriello was able to stay afloat â tickets sell almost didnât fall. Still, the show had to be finished a week earlier than planned., , Many critics have noted that the performance didnât have enough dramatic tension and emotions. Reducing the number of characters of the second plan, who were responsible for realism in Dickensâ novel, also affected the weakening of the total incandescence of production. Many actors have entered in this show from the musical âLes Misâ, so their performance often reminded the previously mentioned play to the critics. Only James Barbour managed to reveal his character in the best way. The deep baritone of singer and his passion ideally suited the embodiment of a lawyer, who sacrificed his life for the sake of happiness of his beloved person. A Broadway newcomer Brandi Burkhardt also brilliantly proved herself. Image of Lucie Manette in her performance has left the audience very impressed., , The musical has received three nominations for Drama Desk award, two Outer Critics Circle and one at Drama League. Production gained 10 victories in 12 categories in general for the Sarasota Magazine Theatre Award. The performance received 2 awards from the Florida's Curtain Call. Musical was nominated for Broadway World Fan-Choice in 7 categories. Despite its light shortcomings, the show had a success with the audience. It survived for two Japanese productions, three Korean, and one of every of those: Irish, Welsh, Scottish, English, German, as well as a big number of American productions. Classical work submitted via songs continues in different theaters of the world at the moment of writing these lines down."
"395","Tarzan ","    Musical âTarzanâ has likely been designed for family viewing. The story, which appeared more than a hundred years ago, is known to all generations. After the eponymous films and colorful cartoons (and the latest film of mid-2016) children is sure to be of interest to look at this theatrical performance. Bright scenery and costumes, wonderful music by Phil Collins, the constant change of events are unlikely to leave anyone indifferent. Particular interest raises acrobatic implementation. A lot of action in the play takes place at the height and actors sometimes sweep over the heads of the audience. In terms of technology, the show is very complex. The predominance of green color, hanging lianas â all this jungle stylization is very plausible. And in combination with the play of light and shade, it creates a 3D effect. The distance between the stage and the auditorium of beholders fades out â it is worth a look!, , When watching the show, emotions of actors so clearly expressed, that at some point viewers cease to distinguish between ones acting people and animals. Probably, each one looking at the scene will get emotional message from a certain character of his kind. Here are present all-consuming and all-forgiving mother's love â in the face of a female gorilla Kala, who loves her baby, no matter what. And the leader Kerchak, who performs his duty to protect his family and flock till the very end. Although between the gorilla-leader and Tarzan there is a certain rivalry, as it happens between father and son, only in the finale it becomes clear â just growing up to adulthood, you can understand the motives of some of the actions of adults. In terms of educational issue, this performance is of great momentum â children should learn the world on these stories. In musical, there are many oppositions, constant struggle, and of course, a love triangle. All these conflicts quickly replace one another and keep the audience in suspense. Actions are very dynamic and fast, so the time flies by, the play looks at one go. , , To make the show, according to different estimates, were spent from 12 to 15 million dollars. Whether such investments had been justified â there is no official information from all sources. But as we can consider from the similar productions, budgets like these recoup themselves only after 500-600 productions. So may it be quite true that the investments were of zero profit. At least, producers didnât lose much or almost nothing. , , Production had good reviews in the press. For the German staging, actors were taken on a reality show. In Germany, the histrionics has been popular amongst tourists â many adjusted their routes to get to the show. On the tourist forums, people even shared information, where to stay better, to be closer to the theater. So no wonder that German production was the longest in time amongst all., , The musical has received the following awards: the prize for a breakthrough musical talent received an actor R. Link for the role of Tarzan in 2007; a full-length musical best actor â C. Peroti for the role of Terk in 2007; the prize for best full-fledged musical â in 2008. It also received nominations: best designer; best lighting design; best sets; best creative achievement."
"396","Tell Me On A Sunday ","    The setting was conceived by Tim Rice, a partner of A. Lloyd Webber, shortly after their successful work on the musical âEvitaâ. Despite her interest in the show, the composer did not agree to give the role of an English woman, who dated a married man who had two children, to actress Elaine Paige. Having quarreled about this issue with Tim, Lloyd Webber has terminated the relationship with Mr. Rice. Afterwards Don Black was invited as the composer. The concept remained the same â a lonely Englishwoman wrote letters home in which told her mother how she was doing in a foreign country. On the stage, there was only one actress â voices of other characters were heard from behind the scenes. Since the main burden fell on one person, leading performer was supposed to be a very bright person with a strong character. Marti Webb, who played this character for the first time, met all the demands of the authors of the histrionics. , , Song cycle refers to one of the lesser-known works by A. Lloyd Webber. But individual compositions have become quite popular among the audience. This was due to the fact that the play was shown on television several times. Many critics have considered the role of an English woman thin and shallow due to a lack of depth in the female character. That is why the leading performer had to compensate the missing elements of production with her energy and experience. Through inner strength, the same actress was able to play this role after more than 30 years. The work of Marti Webb has been appreciated not only by the audience, but also by critics. They noted that the woman has not changed much over the years. When the actress began to sing, the difference between the early and late appearances did not exist., , The staging has attracted attention in both the original version, and as a two-act musical. After reconsideration of the production for Broadway, previously depersonalized Englishwoman was given name Emma. The London version of the theatrical with ballet has received two nominations for the Laurence Olivier Award. Staging on Broadway has been nominated for Grammy. Also, this production won in one category out of three Drama Desks. It was nominated at Tony Award 8 times. , , Broadway production received the maximum amount of revenue for the weekend â 300,940 dollars â in December 1985. During the last weekend of the show in November 1986, it grossed only USD 151,684. The musical continues to attract attention â in March 2016, a UK tour with Jodie Prenger began, the new muse of Lloyd Webber. Excellent performance of the talented actress has deeply touched the public. In the first act goes a musical production, and after the break viewers have the opportunity to have a conversation with the performer and her understudy Beth Meyer. The actress also performs an encore with her favorite songs. Music of A. Lloyd Webber is gorgeous â show of this composer always attracted the big attention of beholders."
"397","That's What Kids Do ","    Songs composed by music graduate of Berkeley College, were recorded by bands âKool & The Gangâ, âThe Manhattansâ & âNew Editionâ. Many artists â D. Ross, A. Jarreau â also included songs by C. Block in their repertoires. Her song sounded in the film âDo The Right Thingâ. A gifted composer plays the flute, guitar & banjo. Once a woman has decided to start composing music for young listeners & their parents, as there were very few works that would make interest to both adults & children. Also, Cathy Block was affected by her own family situation â the composer has three daughters. Her first album was awarded with Editor's Choice by the ALA & TTP Platinum. In 1999, the composer has created a children's choir. Age of members ranged from 4.5 to 14 years. A year later, âThe Living Green Children's Chorusâ performed a musical revue for the first time. The play was performed in several US states & abroad. Songs from the play belonged to different styles of music; their lyrics can be called humorous & poignant. , , The idea of writing a musical about school time came to Cathy Block at a time when she saw the daughtersâ interest to her stories about own childhood. After talking with many friends, she found out that people had similar memories about own early years. The musical received rave reviews from the public â many viewers themselves were in similar situations, of which told the participants of the choir. The show gradually became the first part of a trilogy, telling of life of students in elementary school & then they moved to the middle classes. As a music teacher, Cathy Block perfectly understood the difficulties of many kids who have adapted badly to the start of new classes & new environments. Questions raised in the songs are relevant to each of the young generation, coming into the school for the first time. Search for friendship, love & joy of life interests a person regardless of age. Therefore, the musical was highly appreciated not only by children but also by their parents. Revue is ideal for production in schools with own choirs."
"398","The Thing About Men ","    The musical âThe Thing About Menâ is the second work of the tandem of Joe Dipietro & Jimmy Roberts. The first one 'I Love You' had commercial success, and on this wave was created the second one. In it, on supporting roles were introduced actors from the first cast, maybe for good luck. Success has not been reached; it failed. But for lovers of light unpretentious comedies that show is exactly what is needed. , , Old as the world story, where people have been long living in a marriage, lose all interest in each other, and try to find the missing emotions on the side. And only when the marriage ruins, they start to appreciate it. You look at all the attempts of Tom, his tricks, with a smile. The character is familiar and close, because everything had to cheat and deceive their partners once, and many of us are familiar with all-consuming jealousy. A man accustomed to manage others, considers himself irresistible, cannot accept losing. In the course of the play, the impression is that he does not try to save his family, but simply is interested in what his wife has found about this artist Sebastian. Therefore, the desire to keep the family together and to stay a friend of lover of his wife is unnatural and not credible. At least, not for everyone., , Character of woman Lucy, too, is not much concerned about the preservation of the family. The fact that her husband has disappeared, as it seems, cares her a little. And the artist, who received a good job, no longer interests her. Thus, we can see yet another side of her attraction to him: she wants him to be a gigolo. She wants to possess him by means of money that empowers her and gives her potency. Having a poor, dependent lover, was much better for her. This is a normal life of spoiled and rich woman who loved to arrange scandals, who believes that her person was unfairly deprived of attention. Maybe, she was, but she used her money instead, to have a lover, not a soul mate., , We see Sebastian as a typical gigolo, not without the skills of the artist. To settle himself to certain rich lady was a normal practice for him. It seems that he does not know how to live differently. The main thing is to fit the group of people who call themselves âLa Bohemeâ. So Tom had to persuade a painter to get a job to fit a woman like Lucy, but eventually, he was mistaken., , None of the characters causes sympathy or empathy. Yes, probably, it is not much necessary for a comedy. This performance has no positive or negative characters. It does not evaluate the good or bad notions. People simply live like that. The whole story is like a fairy tale, all the worries of the characters â are love affairs. After viewing, remains a good mood and airiness. There are no social conflicts, hard struggle or sophisticated overtones. It is the thing, with which itâs good to finish the day."
"399","They're Playing Our Song ","    The basis of the musical is the real story of the composer Hamlisch and poetess C. Sager. We can see how difficult the creative process is. Especially when it involves two talented and creative individualities. Such cooperation gives birth to such products that are listened for many years, by several generations. It is difficult to imagine how these two people could fit together in everyday life. Only unifying power of art makes these two antipodes reconciled. , , Very interesting to see how serious and balanced Vernon is trying to work with âcrazyâ Sonia. The audience is sympathetic to the composer in the course of the play, constantly asking oneself why did he tolerate her, how can she mock a celebrity. Probably, a composer has personal interest in this woman. Perhaps, the understanding that only stepping through these difficulties, a masterpiece can be born, makes him work hard. We can observe that creative people live quite difficult emotionally life, sometimes on the verge. , , For Sonia, it is a normal state â to live among the squabbling and scandals. It seems that she takes the creative powers from such tensed atmosphere. This explains her long reluctance to break with former lover Leon. She probably could not exist in quiet atmosphere. Instead, Vernon received a breakdown. But when the happy end comes, and the creative union reunites, you understand that these people have truly found each other. , , Light and high sensation remains after seeing the musical. Of special interest, it will be for ones who love to watch the complex relationship between man and woman. Well, the beautiful music will not leave anyone indifferent. CD with songs from this musical are produced so far. Composer M. Hamlisch with actors R. Klein & L. Arnaz still organize recitals for musical fans, having the great success. , , The play has received World Theatre Award. It was nominated several times on Tony in 1979 and Drama Desk 4 times; to Laurence Olivier Aw. in 1980 3 times."
"400","Thoroughly Modern Millie ","    Spectacular âThoroughly Modern Millieâ looks more like a good fairy tale. It is written after the eponymous film of 1967 with magnificent Julie Andrews in the main role. This is the story that stays modern till now. Many of its turns are used even in 2016âs animated motion picture âZootopiaâ, which gained more than USD 1 billion in the box office. It shows that this story can happen not only in any country, but even in the minded-up animal society., , This is a typical story of a girl from the provinces who came to conquer big New York. Twenties years of the last century were not the best times for the country. There are gloomy characters (like Miss Meers) in the performance, and the scene of the robbery, which is classical for New York, is also included. But all this cannot spoil the atmosphere of overall joy and fun and expectations for new achievements. Due to saturation of performance with dances, songs, very cheerful and bright costumes, life seems bright and carefree on the scene. Optimism and easy attitude to the problems of the main characters are staggering. These are her words that really represent a girl: âI have decided to marry my boss, but I do not have one yetâ. Only a person who infinitely believes in herself, in her good fortune, and sees no obstacles, can succeed. Indeed, it did not work with the boss, but she received a rich prince who told everyone he was poor (this turn of scenario was used in the film with Eddie Murphy, when he went to US to find his true love and told everyone he was a poor fellow, not a countryâs prince). Realizing that such luck falls one in a million, you still believe it after seeing the musical. Especially when here and there, you see lots of young rich guys, whose richness can only be explained as pure luck or exhibiting themselves in the social networks. Perhaps thanks to this philosophy of success, the show has become so popular. The viewer sees a positive development of life scenario, of which everyone dreams. , , Music, lyrics, provocative dancing, perfectly staged light, constantly changing faces and scenic costumes not for a minute allow the viewer to get bored. This is a kind story, where good always triumphs over evil, especially when evil here is blurry and general notion of âevilâ means poorness and lack of money in life. It is good to visit theater in a big company as a continuation of friendly party. Positive emotions are provided, and after watching, you can continue to have fun!, , The musical won the awards from: Drama Desk as an outstanding musical in 2002; best actress â S. Foster; best director â M. Mayer; outstanding orchestration â D. Besterman & R. Burns; 5 Tony Awards; the show was nominated for Drama Desk in six categories."
"401","Tick, Tick... Boom ","    There are few real-life musical theatre stories more tragic than Jonathan Larsonâs. At least... stories about successful composers. His breakout hit Rent spoke to a generation of theatregoers â and in later years, letâs face it, hipsters. Though it proved Broadway musicals could both be critical darlings and box office gold, even in the 90âs, Larson would not live to enjoy its success, tragically passing away the night before Rentâs first Off-Broadway performance., , The showâs success however did open a crack in the window of opportunity for Larsonâs other, lesser known musical, Tick, Tick... Boom!, which in a masterstroke of inventiveness follows a young musical theatre composer named Jon (Parris Greaves), who is turning 30 and still not self-sustaining in his artistic career., , Write what you know, they say., , Letâs forget Rent for a moment. In scale and tone, Tick, Tick... Boom! is much closer to intimate chamber musicals such as The Last 5 Years, Ordinary Days and [title of show], which have been doing the rounds with alarming regularity on the virtue that theyâre for the most-part fairly inoffensive, play well to the musical theatre âinâ crowd and can be produced on a shoestring budget. Many of these shows work splendidly, others... not so much., , Tick, Tick... Boom! kind of has a foot in each camp, and by âfootâ I mean about half of its running time. It doesnât really find a voice to call its own until about the halfway point, skittering around the cringe-inducing Green Green Dress and fun, but somewhat silly numbers like Johnny Canât Decide and Sunday in the meantime. But when it does hit its stride, right around the time Jonâs labour-of-love musical goes to workshop, we get flashes of energy and willingness to take risks that not only foreshadow Rent, but demonstrate just what the musical theatre world may have lost when Larson passed., , Yet even these strengths reveal a composer still getting a handle on the idea of an integrated narrative. For instance, the showâs most powerful emotional punch comes when Karessa, an otherwise fairly forgettable cast member in Jonâs show (Karessa, that is, not Laura Mae Naeson, whoâs a powerhouse in this role and others) delivers Come To Your Senses â sure enough, her number in Jonâs show. The bookâs most powerful moment comes moments later during a confrontation between Jon and long-time best friend Michael (Ken Chamberland). In fact, thereâs enough surprising depth to the latter half of the book that it mostly smoothes over the awkwardness of the opening. It can sometimes feel like a stuttering patchwork of highlights, but they are highlights all the same. On a darker note, some aspects of the plot provide an eerie foreshadowing of real life events. After all, this is a musical about realizing youâre getting older and fretting not having done anything worthwhile with your youth., , Greaves does a fine job of navigating Jon through the fairly familiar narrative without resorting to irritating, neurotic New York artist stereotypes. Yes, there are moments in which the book is doing him no favours â Larson clearly loved to break the fourth wall with narration and a couple of numbers meant to show Jon as âa regular guyâ come across as a touch grotesque. Still, Greaves is likeable and engaging throughout. Likewise Chamberland, who along with Nason covers several roles with varying degrees of camp, sincerity and flash. He does unfortunately come across a bit âKen dollâ at times, but what comes through when he does show a bit of vulnerability is delightful. Nason meanwhile owns the stage whenever she sings (and is it just me, or is Susan really just an extension of Companyâs Kathy?)., , Tick, Tick... Boom! is conspicuously the debut musical of a composer, book-writer and lyricist who should, and I believe would have gone on to give us many more great musicals. As it stands, this is a spirited, well-cast production of a modest show thatâs testament to that potential. Not so much essential viewing as a charming and fun curiosity well worth the price of admission."
"402","Titanic ","    Theatre community quite coldly met a theatrical about the legendary vessel Titanic. Many publications ambiguously expressed their opinions about the Broadway musical, but they have not affected the beholdersâ opinions. A spectacular was produced more than 1,000 times by different troupes, and in whatever country it may come, the huge excitement was definitely provided. This is largely connected with the tragedy that leaves no one indifferent. But to downplay the work of writers and producers also not good., , The show started a few months before the premiere of James Cameron, which was held in November. We can say that the legendary film raised a wave of interest to this topic again, which afterwards became the subject of many documentaries, books and articles., , To make histrionics about the tragedy, where died more than 1,500 people, was a completely hard task. Peter Stone has chosen the right path for his creation: he used real historical facts and characters. The changes affected only those parts that were needed to provide the entertainment part in the musical. It focuses on real characters, which gives this performance the real human face. Unlike the film, the musical introduces us to characters much closer. We see people of different classes. Some of them were on the ship because the Old World could not offer them a decent standard of living, while others â because of the abundance of resources and the desire to see the world. , , The brilliant concept of developers worth mentioning: they allowed the viewer to watch the characters located on three different decks simultaneously. A scene with a tilting the vessel down, filled with horror, plunges men, women and children into shock. The effect of it on the audience can hardly be overestimated. The team managed to make it stunning and realistic. , , There is no doubt that the âTitanicâ is the landmark of American musicals area. No wonder it has experienced many revivals, and still attracts the attention of the public."
"403","Title Of Show ","    From the first sight, this performance might seem to be nothing special. It is even hard to believe that critics and the audience like it. But if you watch it, you will understand, why the histrionics deserves to be a part of Broadwayâs history., , The cast is extremely small. You can see just four performers on the stage. Those actors are not even well-known; you will never recognize their faces. But their talent and creativity made them popular after participating in this staging. They are so gifted, that the cast has stayed the same during Broadway, Off-Broadway and tour versions of the staging., , The strongest singer in this performance appeared to be Heidi Blickenstaff. She is also the only actress in the production, who has already been noticed on Broadway. All the rest of the cast had this musical as a kind of starting point in their careers. After this, they were invited to participate in many other works on Broadway. Susan Blackwell was even asked to take part in a few television shows. And now she is a host of her own show on Broadway.com. The actors, playing male roles, are fantastically charismatic. They make the spectators laugh and feel excitement. Their dialogues smoothly turn into songs. The so-called singing dialogue of the leading actresses is both funny and beautiful., , The costumes of the performers are quite usual. There are no bright colors, glares and exotic features in their outfit. We see plain people in simple clothes. But all these things make the show closer to reality. And this is the key point of the production â to tell a real story of creation of the musical. Every day problems and obstacles, with which real actors face in this sphere, are displayed. , , The compositions, written by talented American composer Jeff Bowen, are perky and extremely funny. The actors very often break into songs and dances, which makes the spectacle lively and energetic., , Michael Berresse, a director, did an impressive job. He managed to compose jokes and songs together, creating a harmonious stream and telling the story. Here you will also see many Broadway clichÃ©s, which are actually proper for such type of a show. It is also full of allusions to some obscure musicals, such as Kwamina. You might not notice them from the first view though. Berresse was not only a director, but also a choreographer, whose dances are simple, but marvelous. For this musical, he was nominated for Lucille Lortel Award in both direction and choreography. He got Obie Award as well., , It is hard to call this staging to be a part of popular crowd. It will never be adored by everyone on Broadway. But it still occupies its niche in the theatrical world. The spectacle is something new, original, full of fun and truth about the lives of actors and their hard work., , The popularity of this production started to grow from the first display. It even has a video blog about the process of its creation. Besides the Broadway and Off-Broadway showings, there were regional versions and the performances in several Australian cities."
"404","Toxic Avenger","    The first production was accepted by the audience quite positively. Most people and critics liked it a lot. The next staging, which was displayed in New York, was disputable. The New York Times called this version too silly. New York Post described it as a funny thing. Despite such difference in points of view, we can say for sure that this musical is a significant thing. It is proved by so many revivals, the latest of which were in 2016. , , Look at the cast first. The critics from Bloomberg.com called them astonishing. Nick Cordero â a Canadian actor, who obtained the leading role in this Off-Broadway performance â made a debut here. His acting was so funny and convincing, that it was hard not to notice him. His metamorphoses from super-nerd to slime-dripping hulk are impressive. After this, he was invited to play in several Broadway productions. Another gifted person in the staging is Nancy Carol Opel. Her transformations from one character to the other are fantastic. You will probably not notice that it is one and the same actress playing two different roles. This nominee for Tony Award brought a part of success to this spectacle. The most hilarious scene was when she had to play her both roles. The characters were involved into a duet, and her flitting above the stage was just funny and amazing. One more leading actress â Sara Chase â is prominent for her vibrant and beautiful voice. , , Secondary roles should be mentioned as well. Matthew Saldivar and Demond Green give the audience an additional chance to laugh. The director of the show â John Rando â deserves special grace. He managed to create such an outstanding thing with just five actors on the stage! He also made the musical to be full of humor and silly things. Of course, the actorsâ talent is essential here. Without it, the show would never become a masterpiece. You should not forget that Rando is a Tony Award winner for his outstanding direction. So, we cannot refuse that the greatest part of fame of this performance belongs to his work., , The music takes special place here. We must thank Joe DiPietro and David Bryan â two people, who were responsible for the creation of the songs. You will hear 18 compositions, each of which is gorgeous. The critics say that the music in this production has irresistible driving quality. It is important to know that David Bryan was one of Bon Jovi founding members and their keyboardist. Thatâs why he managed to write music, which is just perfect for a rock show. He was also the author of the songs for the other successful Broadway spectacles., , The costumes of the performers are nice and original. The main hero looks just like real mutant, damaged by toxic waste. , , In general, the musical is worth watching. It is hard to believe that a film, which has had a low budget and has not been too popular, has been transformed into such hit production. If you want to spend a wonderful evening, to relax, to enjoy talented acting and to receive many positive emotions â this spectacle is just for you!"
"405","Triumph Of Love ","    The play, based on which this theatrical was staged, was written in the XVIII century, in the era of the French Enlightenment. That is why overly emotional characters fully reflect the essence of that time. It is a fascinating story, full of sharp phrases, humor, irony, and disguise, could not escape from the suffering, starving to quality stories, viewers and theater directors. For them it was a possibility to display on the stage that uplifted intellectual game, and the ease, which marks the whole spirit of the French Enlightenment era., , For the main characters, it is quite normal to go on stage and announce their plans. Just like that, without concealing anything, to announce that the main goal of life is love, passionate and all-consuming. And everything in their life is subject only to the love and passion. If you are not ready for such a turn of events, you will find the action on the stage at least illogical and strange. , , Generally, Marivauxâs heroes very often change their hypostasis. The servants begin to play the role of the hosts and the hosts suddenly transform into servants. In the play âTriumph of Loveâ plot twists even more bright: girls dress up like men not to reveal who they really are. , , At the same time, the main character desperately wants to marry only that man whom she will love, but that does not stop her to seduce all the men that are found in her path. Obviously, for reason â she follows her local everyday goals in this way., , By the way, while in the hall, you catch yourself thinking âBut who really the main character is? The warrior and cunning queen? Or a woman in love, who put her feeling onto a pedestal? Or just an ordinary liar?â. The truth lies somewhere in between and there is no only single right answer on this question., , Especially strong was one of the latest scenes, which reveals the real face of the princess. The entire scene is filled with candles â symbols of human lies. They illumine with light just as the truth illuminates the protagonistsâ faces. A bit unrealistic looks denial of the true heir of Sparta of his retaliation. He easily refuses to forgive the one, whose parents killed his relatives. Explanation of everything is only one â love, captivated the heart of a young man. He is ready to forgive the insult, because now his kingdom will be managed by loyal wife who also had put love above bitterness and desire for revenge."
"406","Two Gentlemen of Verona ","    A play âTwo Gentlemen of Veronaâ, written by Shakespeare in his early years, is considered not very popular because of the distraction of the plot. Performances and musicals on it in different years were produced by a few (opposed to the famous âRomeo and Julietâ, âThe Comedy of Errorsâ and âTwelfth Nightâ). B. Mel Shapiro did it, making some adjustments, so the story was not so disjointed and illogical. And his idea has been very successful, as evidenced by the main Tony Award. , , The musical is difficult to call entirely comedy, because the story tells of the betrayal, and this fact causes a lot of problems during the plot. But to call it romantic is more than appropriate. Not for nothing at the beginning and the end of the performance, cupids sprinkled the scene with red hearts deftly. Yes, and the story ends on a positive note: friends finally managed with their relationship and with their beloved ones too., , The story of two best friends, who left their native Verona to go to Milan for the education purposes and knowledge of life, quickly gains colors: Proteus, sworn to marry Julia (who, in addition, was pregnant from him), falls in love with a girl of his friend. Obsessed with passion, he decides to betray friendship, telling a father of beauty Silvia about plans of lovers to flee the nearest night. Incidentally, it is interesting that after the expulsion from the palace of the duke, Valentine, who came to Milan to study and to know life, is going to the lair of thieves, becoming their leader. , , Meanwhile, a pregnant Julia decides not to waste time in vain and goes after her lover. But for women it was very dangerous to travel alone in those times, so brave girl decided to disguise as a man. Very soon, she learns about the fickleness of her lover, but follows him persistently. By the way, when she appears before him in the men's attire, young man doesnât recognize his disguised beloved. Comical situation, isnât it?!, , And these twists and turns would not experience the end, if in the final stage they did not forgive each other. Men understood one another, and took care with their feelings. Valentine remained with the daughter of the duke and Proteus â with Julia. , , Love is the leitmotif of the entire musical, as even servants gained their happiness. Many critics have noted that the dialogues in the play at times looked very sloppy, but the music part covered those mistakes. Immersing yourself in the story, you sometimes sympathize to the characters, but only partially, because the story looks rather comical. Music in performance largely reflects the spirit of the '70s. At has a lot of funk and rock music. Playful theatrical was popular with the public not for nothing. Talented actors, great dancing, and beautiful scenery have done their job."
"407","Unsinkable Molly Brown","    Musical comedy on stage and screen immortalized among Americans and opened to wide European audience the name of Margaret Brown â activist and a fashionable lady, one of the real survivors of Titanic liner amongst passengers. Margaret grew up in poverty and rose up to fame and fortune using only her own efforts., , In fact, this histrionic, as a representative of the golden classics of Broadway, embodies a true âAmerican dreamâ. Poor girl, and no less poor at first her fiancÃ©, at the end gain monetary wealth and universal recognition. The couple was adopted even by very capricious with its subtle flavors secular society. All this grace fell into their hands not because of family ties, nor because of a rich uncle, who left a legacy, but only because of their own efforts and exclusively because of them. Isnât this what is expected by many Americans and ordinary people from the rest part of the world?, , But the story is filled with not so simple and straightforward things. The main character is destined to lift up a bit some historical layer â how Titanic died, how she managed to escape not enviable fate of the rest of its passengers. Therefore, the ocean linerâs tragedy does not leave only the heavy memories; it does not seem so hopeless. Rather, the story of Margaret Brown becomes more significant against the backdrop of such a serious accident. Molly was a real national hero, immortalized in the musical performance. Those who watched Titanic by James Cameron, for sure remember Molly Brown amongst the characters â she dressed-up young Jack for the dinner., , It is also interesting that although the biography of Margaret overgrown with all sorts of stories and fables because of reporters and journalists, the show is almost autobiographical musical about Mollyâs childhood, who really had the character of a fighter, and she was not ready to live with own poverty and illiteracy. She tried every way to enter to a better life and wanted to cultivate. And even when on the way to her personal happiness has risen disastrous wreck of the ship from colliding with an iceberg, it did not break her, but even made it possible to save the lives of many other passengers., , This musical is easy to perceive, cheerful and instructive â it is full of fun melodies, evokes positive emotions, recreates perfect suits of the era and the entourage of the beginning of the century. And those facts, as the produced radio play, the shot film, and the performed musical based on the book, as well as repeated revivals of it through dozens of years, say that the golden classic with a good story basis, affecting the eternal values, never loses popularity."
"408","Urinetown ","    Despite the dubious name, which only at the very beginning prevented the show to win the stages of Broadway, âUrinetownâ perfectly reflects the essence of satire and parody of the modern capitalist society. Name and meaning breaks taboos on what in polite circles is not accepted to talk of. The story and song compositions are constructed in a way so each song concludes a parody of the genre of musicals in general, or the melody has a reference to other famous shows. This what makes this performance special, independent, giving it a unique banter, burlesque, charm and flavor., , It's not just a comedy, it's a political satire too. There is a place for simple blackish humor and fine English one and even sardonic, from which literally start to have goose bumps and it becomes sad and terrible for the general future of Mankind, leading reckless mode of consumption existence., , The authors were able to build the action so that the full buffoonery apparent at first has not rolled into the full circus. Development of the plot is perceived quite naturally, it is very similar to the surrounding reality. In addition, the sad events of the second act, growing as a snowball, only force to think deeper about everything happening at our planet. As a result, the creators did completely non-standard, smart and wading to the core spectacle, the whole point of which is understandable and recognizable. It is somewhat similar to âIn Timeâ with Justin Timberlake, the same dystopia world, where the most precious resource is time, and every person had limited time to live. It is a matter of trade and stealing and it is also a currency. Very similar stories, indeed. And in the end there is no place for a happy ending, which is also rarely found in Broadway â that is the distinction from âIn Timeâ., , From a music point of view, the play is even more unusual. Sometimes there is a well-arranged music and vocal compositions with complex melodies, with choral singing and the performance with canons, to which you immediately want to sing along. Frequently heard scores with minimal orchestration. Their lyrics and meaning are of paramount importance; sound design deliberately simple and sounds like an accompaniment or even a cacophonous jumble of sounds, just shading or highlighting the essence of what is happening., , The fact that almost immediately after the release of the satirical show, a complete audio version was also released, speaks of its high popularity among the audience. Theatrical gives you the opportunity not only to relax and laugh, but to think about very serious issues. Due to the fact that the musical does not take too many characters, the scenery is simple and unpretentious, it is often produced on school and student scenes. So the musical still exists today."
"409","Vanities ","    This is a story about the friendship of three girls â participants of cheerleaders group. They tell the story of their lives, sing, dance, and dress up. The life of each girl has various twists and turns, but one thing remains the same â their friendship, which originated back in school time. Each of them pursues her own goal: Mary is a rebel, she is opposed to everything, looking for her fight around the clock; Joanne wants to become a model of perfect wife to her husband, and the mother of his children, but for this, she needs to grow spiritually; Kathy differs with organization skills and zest for life, she was always ready for both good and bad. , , The action covers 15 years of the life of girls. For the first time, we meet them before the match of the school team begins. The President and his wife have to visit the match, and the girls are very exciting to see the dress of the First Lady. The next meeting of the characters holds 4 years later, when they reflect about the future marriages., , Now we see that one of the cheerleader girls is in a civil marriage with a certain rich man. Other friends, who came to visit the girl, blame her for her relationship with a married man, even though he owns the fortune., , In fact, on stage we do not see how anything happens to the girls. The viewer sees only the heroinesâ reaction to what happened, not the situations themselves. Some might say that the first rule of the theater is not respected (âdo not tell, show itâ), but it's a matter of taste. By the way, the dialogues are sometimes scarce and superficial., , Music is not memorable. From the action, where the main emphasis is on the music, you expect more. Each period of lives of friends is marked by the music of that time. By the way, the press also chilly accepted the premiere of a musical, as well as the album. The ""New York Times"" called the plot woo familiar; the ""New York Daily News"" noted that in spite of the charming actresses, the material was quite weak."
"410","Very Good Eddie ","    This histrionics shows us how âBroadwayâ style of musical theater was formed. This was one of the first successful works of luminaries and pioneers of modern musicals, writer Guy Bolton and composer Jerome Kern. In fact, it was vaudeville, adapted to the American audience., , The comedy-farce, which tells about the adventures of young couples on a pleasure boat and in a hotel. Funny situations and simple plot do not make the viewer be particularly tensed. The story of the little man â a popular theme in the beginning of the century for the American entertainment industry. A man who lives in a huge, fast-growing industrial society. In a society where the individualism is lost completely. A prime example is Charlie Chaplin with his Little Tramp. In this theatrical, a little man (Eddie) can be a support and defense and can adopt own decisions (which he couldnât do earlier, before being put in non-habitual conditions), and in the end people may shout to him âvery good, mister!â. Heroes constantly fall into uncomfortable situations, which often create at their own., , Looking through the play, you like return to the beginning of the twentieth century, although the play was adapted in 1975. It was created for small, existing at that time Broadway stages with a very limited budget. Therefore, the story and the scenery create a certain comfort â everything looks simple enough, without unnecessary pomposity. Here you will not see the colorful costumes, no complex technical solutions in the scenery. Everything is holds on the music and the actors' performance. Although there is no precise data about the commercial success of the play, we realize the popularity of the musical and low production expenses â it all contributed a lot to its financial success. , , This is a good option for family viewing, easy and fun play. Conflict situations arising in the course of the action resolved easily and without strain. The theatrical has no negative characters, and even alcohol-abuse receptionist at the hotel is also not an evil, but funny fellow., , The play was nominated for the Drama Desk in 1976 as outstanding revival. Outstanding actress in a musical â V. Seidel; outstanding actor â J. Harder; outstanding featured actress â T. Hudson., , Nominations at Tony in 1976: the best performance of the title role â S. Repole; the best performance of the musical actress â V. Seidel; Best director â B. Gile. Theatre World Award in 1976 â 2 pieces. Nomination for the London production in 1976: 1 Laurence Olivier."
"411","Very Potter Sequel","    This theatrical is an adaptation of a number of works from the series by J. K. Rowling, a story about Harry Potter, and films made on their basis. The show is a continuation of performance, which shows the life of the young wizard in the school of magic. There is also a third episode exists, which focuses on the grown-up Harry Potter. Very often, the productions by the fans are of no particular quality. In the case, this had not happened. Despite the fact that the play has been made by college students, the level of acting was very high. In the theatrical, there are many jokes that will be understood only by one who read the books or watched films about the young wizard. But even for the uninitiated viewer, thereâll be many interesting stories that took place in the extraordinary, magic world of Hogwarts. , , Almost all the leading roles were after the same actors. New, very talented performers were also added. Grotesque style opened to the creators of the show great potential â both in the construction of the plot, and in the implementation of the play. In the histrionics, male and female roles were mixed: Lauren Lopez played Draco Malfoy, and Joseph Walker â Dolores Umbridge. Many critics have noted the perfect embodiment of these characters, which had often eclipsed the skills of leading performers of the play. Very funny plot twists, made up by violent imagination of writers, discovered viewers many personal secrets of characters that have not been previously mentioned in the books of Mrs. Rowling. , , Critics have pointed out that the second variant was more elaborate in terms of stage design and costumes than the first one. They also noted the presence of deep sense in the music compositions of the play. Some of the reviewers preferred the previous show, while others considered sequel more spectacle. They also drew attention to the excessive workload of the plot â the creators tried to fill the libretto with maximum details from the original work of Rowling but had space to add their own innovative ideas. Satirical images of favorite characters were liked by viewers very much. This sequel did not have so much vivid and memorable songs as the 1st part. However, they were of a great attention by listeners almost immediately after the appearance of the musical on YouTube happened â in the first two days, it was watched by over 160 000 people! After the success of the second part of the show, organizers have decided to create a third episode, which focused on the life of Harry Potter after his victory over Voldemort."
"412","Very Potter","    A parody musical is an adaptation of several novels in a series of books about Harry Potter, written by J. K. Rowling. This production was the second production by the students of the University of Michigan, who created their theater company âStarKidâ. Taking as the basis the story of the most famous characters of children's literature of the XXI century, the brothers Lang and B. Holden wrote the script. They were able to squeeze into the musical a significant portion of the entire storytelling about a young wizard and his friends. Music tracks can be attributed to the rock style. A. J. Holmes and D. Criss managed to create very catchy melodies and humorous lyrics. Fans of Harry Potter appreciated the parody histrionics very much. Despite the distinct American humor in the musical, life of the characters is shown with a kind irony. The production cannot be called satire. On the contrary, it is clear that the creators of the production themselves are very fond of stories about a boy, and were trying to express their feelings in an entertaining way. , , Thanks to the Internet, studentâs brainchild has become famous around the world. Musicalâs millions of views on YouTube showed that love for the heroes of J. K. Rowling did not disappear after the writer has made a brake in a series of novels about Harry Potter before starting her new series about mystical creatures. The audience appreciated the show a lot. They particularly noted the excellent cooperation inside the trio of D. Criss, J. Richter and B. Gruesen, performing the roles of Harry, Ron and Hermione accordingly. Also, the audience was impressed by L. Lopez, who played Draco Malfoy. Tantrums and whims of this character were remembered by many viewers. It felt that the creators decided not to limit the staging only with Harry Potter characters. The lion transferring Albus Dumbledore in the other world was very similar to the character of Narnia stories. Also, the writers decided to emphasize the non-traditional orientation of Hogwartsâ director. Due to the success of the first musical, its directors made two continuations about Harry Potterâs life. These shows have also made a great impression on the audience and critics. Grotesque images of characters allowed creators to sneer at their favorite characters, not falling down to the coarse jokes. Magic inherent in books and films about Harry Potter, of course, penetrated into this performance too. The fans of the works of J. K. Rowling can once again dive into the extraordinary world of witchcraft and wizardry."
"413","Victor   Victoria ","    The plot of the histrionics is based on the script of the film of the same name, released in 1982, which received many cinematic awards. The story itself of a change of attires of men into women and vice versa is used in theatrical productions from antiquity. Perhaps, the desire to understand the opposite gender, to feel oneself in the body of another person is inherent in most people. Audienceâs interest in such stories never wanes., , For fans of the brilliant Julie Andrews, the fact will be interesting that she had not immediately agreed to this role. The actress was more than forty years at that time, and she thought that she would look strange at the stage in the role of a young singer. Filmmaker Blake Edwards, the husband of the actress, had to persuade her for a long time, as he put a musical specifically for her. Julie coped magnificently. The age difference between the character and the actress was not obvious. Unfortunately, this was one of her last roles in the musical performances, as after a simple surgery to remove polyps in 1998, the actress lost her magnificent voice., , The musical is full of humor, which, however, does not pass the verge of decency. The theme of one-gender love in the show is not pedaling not in positive nor in negative context. It was simply put as a part of society. Especially funny to look at tough mobsters and criminals, who can also be attributed to people with alternative gender orientation. Anyway, this is a real comedy, with colorful costumes, wonderful songs and tremendous cast. The musical does not contain serious confrontations or conflicts. Although many characters are the people from the criminal milieu, they are not revealed as negative characters., , The musical was nominated for a Tony Award for best performance of the title role â J. Andrews. Nomination at Drama Desk for outstanding scenography was given to Robin Wagner. These awards also received: J. Andrews as an outstanding actress in a musical; R. York as an outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical., , Once on the Tony the spectacle was nominated only in one nomination specifically for Julie Andrews, actress considered it an insult to the musical. In her opinion, the entire creative team was wrongly prolapsed with attention and there should be much more nominations. She refused this one, which probably would have won. This scandal only fueled the interest of the audience to the musical and increased the tickets sales. The actress refused to perform at the Tony Award ceremony and organizers have suffered losses due to the absence of the star of this magnitude."
"414","Waitress ","    âWaitressâ owes its sweetness to the mouth-watering goodness of Jessie Mueller. As a diner waitress named Jenna, Mueller is such a honey bun, she melts us like the mounds of butter that make Jennaâs homemade pies so luscious. The musical resorts to comic overkill to create characters based on Adrienne Shellyâs 2007 indie rom-com. But Sara Bareilles has written a charming score that suits the quirky material and Muellerâs dazzling voice and endearing personality., , âBeautifulâ was no fluke. Mueller can really act as well as sing her heart out. Sheâs enchanting as Jenna, who is stuck in a miserable marriage and working as a waitress in a smalltown diner (Scott Pask executed the sunny design of this 1950s throwback) somewhere down south., , , In the sweet opening number (âWhatâs Insideâ), Jenna leads the company in illustrating how she bakes her pies â which are loaded with sugar, as well as creative ingredients like bacon and blueberry â and names them for how sheâs feeling that day. In âWhat Baking Can Do,â she goes deeper and reveals how creating new pies helps her get through her unhappy life., , , Jennaâs only friends are her fellow waitresses, Becky and Dawn (Keala Settle and Kimiko Glenn, nice pipes, but knocking themselves out to be funny). As good friends, they encourage her to enter a pie-baking contest that would win her enough of a nest egg to leave her lazy lug of a husband, Earl. Nick Cordero is stuck in the thankless role of Earl, who is a pure caricature of an insensitive husband â selfish and dreadfully overbearing, but so spineless, he isnât even abusive., , The discovery that Jenna is pregnant kills her escape plan. But it does lead to an affair with the new (and happily married) pediatrician, Dr. Pomatter, appealingly shy and awkward in Drew Gehlingâs performance. This likeable character returns in Act Two, which is one good reason for sticking it out through Act One, which helmer Diane Paulus, who navigated the show through its development at the American Repertory Theater, unwisely chose to play for broad caricature and slapstick laughs., , There are good things in the second act, which is more lyrical and less silly. Gehlingâs eerily beautiful voice turns his love duet with Mueller (âYou Matter to Meâ) into a heartbreaker. Dakin Matthews, as the avuncular diner owner who is actually named Joe, steps out and into the audienceâs arms with his warm and witty solo, âTake It From an Old Man.â One of the waitresses, Keala Settleâs Becky, stops vamping and gets serious in âI Didnât Plan It.â And Mueller allows a proud and self-respecting Jenna to claim her independence in âShe Used to Be Mine.â Itâs a nice moment. Too bad it took so long to get here."
"415","Walmartopia ","    The idea to write a satirical musical came to spouses Andrew Rohn and Catherine Capellaro after numerous articles in the press about how Wal-Mart company violates the rights of its employees. In addition to this information, the creators used the autobiography of the founder of a network of hypermarkets Sam Walton, as well as books by Liza Featherstone and Barbara Ehrenreich. Married couple together with children was living in Madison, when they were asked to come up with political musical to the 10th anniversary of Mercury Players Theatre. Originally, the theatrical should be about confronting of large Overture Center, which opened in their city, and artists who have not received the support of this artistic center. Later Andrew and Catherine considered this topic too narrow and uninteresting for the spectators. So they shifted the action in the hypermarketâs network, which also had human rights violations., , Within a radius of 50 miles from the city of Madison were located 13 Wal-Mart stores. The couple had never worked there, but, thanks to a detailed story of L. Featherstone and B. Ehrenreich, they were able to show the whole inside story of these hypermarkets. Dystopia venomously sneered at the idea of global consumption, nurtured by this monster company. Despite the rather absurd plot, production presented to the public very funny songs and vibrant dances. Extended to two acts, production was shown at the New York stages, but not at the Broadway itself, unfortunately. In the musical, you can hear a variety of music: rumba, hymns, marches, ballads and pop motifs. Anna Jayne Marquardt received an award from the Fringe Festival as an outstanding actress. Staging has become a sensation in New York. The authors of the show hoped that their performance would help people think about how cheap goods for Wal-Mart were created. Also musical could attract the attention of buyers to the local producers, who were losing battle for customers to global corporation. Despite the deep meaning inherent in the staging, the show turned out very easy and fun. Good mood of the audience after watching the performance was the best indicator of the quality of ironical musical."
"416","Water Babies ","    At the heart of the musical is a philosophical tale âThe Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Babyâ, written by the Englishman C. Kingsley in 1862. Also, the show is an adaptation of the animated film of 1978, shot on the same story. The author of a tale was also a clergyman, which had certain influence on his work. At his time, Charles Kingsley was Queen Victoriaâs chaplain and tutor of Prince Wales. Many consider this philosophical fairy tale a fantasy story for children. But it is not only for them but for the adults. Previously only plays were set based on the product but the musical was created for the first time. Thanks to modern technologies, the organizers managed to include the holograms in the set design. The outward appearance of Lord Kraken in the deep sea has been completely created using these effects. A true waterfall was perfect for maintaining an atmosphere of the show, and even a genuine leap of actor from a 10-meter height seemed for many as another fantastic trick. Designer Morgan Large with special decorations showed separation of the two worlds â on-land and underwater ones. Gorgeous costumes, designed by Amy Jackson, added the participants of the musical mystery and romanticism. Amazing discoveries that allowed fully reincarnate actors into lobster, seahorses, eels and so on, were highly appreciated by critics. Lighting design also helped to create the mysterious and magical atmosphere in the theatrical., , After the premiere of the spectacular, criticsâ opinions divided. Some felt that performance in some moments was too stretched, while others have not found serious flaws in the production. Everyone equally celebrated a magnificent stage design of the play. Lyrics were impressive, and the dialogues between the characters were very witty. Despite the obvious influence of the moral and religious aspects of the Victorian era, a musical allowed to exhibit important human qualities as a spiritual rebirth of the protagonist. The story of self-discovery, the search to find true love, and lots of adventure in the underwater world fell for the taste of the public. The reviewers highlighted the song performed by the duo Louise Dearman and Lauren Samuels, after which the room erupted with thunderous applause. They thought it was best composition of the staging. Although some nuances needed further refinement, the show turned out inspiring and touching. According to critics, the play had an excellent chance to become significant musical hit."
"417","We Will Rock You ","    âQueenâ manager J. Beach was thinking about creating a musical back in the mid-1980s. In 1996, an attempt to realize the show was not successful because of the difficulties in the development of production. In 2000, B. Elton came to B. May & R. Taylor with his project. He proposed to create a script based on the songs of the group. Also, B. Elton was inspired by the film âThe Matrixâ, in which people were under the full control of the computer. The work on the script was completed in mid-2001. After the opening night, on the creators of the show originated a wave of criticism, but the audience liked the musical very much. The play was showed during a period of twelve years. It entered the top ten longest shows on the West End., , Tony Vincent's voice is very similar to the vocals of Freddie Mercury, but critics pointed out that his acting skills were not so great as that of the famous singer. Arlene Phillips, created the choreography, previously made clips of Queen. Director Christopher Renshaw was a fan of the band & has dreamed for long to produce a musical based on the famous compositions of F. Mercury & his colleagues. 8 giant plasma screens have been ordered for the special effects of a show. On the creation of production were spent 7.5 million pounds. During the first week of the show, it received box office in the amount of Â£1,2 million, breaking the record of Dominion Theatre, accommodated 2163 seats., , Hits of Queen are known all over the world, therefore the production of the histrionics was carried out in many countries. The London production in 2003 was nominated for the Laurence Olivier & it received 5 awards from Whatsonstage.com Theatergoersâ Choice Award. In 2010, the show won one Laurence Olivier. In 2011, the musical has received another Olivier award. In 2004, the Australian production was 9 times nominated for Helpmann Award, winning 5. In 2006, South African production was 5 times nominated for the Naledi Theatre Award & received 1. In 2007, Canadian production was in 8 nominations for Dora Mavor Moore Award, winning 1. In 2011, the Dutch version 4 times was nominated for Musical Awards Gala. In 2012, the Belgian production gained 1 win out of 3 nominations for Flemish reward., , Brian May & Roger Taylor personally attended the final casting of actors for the Asian production. They said very good things about the skill level of the selected artists there. The show premiered in October 2004 was of a great success, but further exhibiting was cancelled. Musical was translated onto local language, only 3 songs were in English. Perhaps here lies the reason why only 60% of the seats were occupied in the auditorium. This version of the show lasted on the stage less than 4.5 months."
"418","Wedding Singer ","    The musical is an adaptation of the eponymous 1998 movie. Screenwriter T. Herlihy helped to develop the production of this spectacular. Musical compositions were created in the style of the 1980s â from pop ballads and rap to rock motifs. The show is steeped with the spirit of the time. It contains jokes, the meaning of which is only understood by representatives of generation of 80s. The theatrical includes two songs from the film, written by Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandler. The creators were able to realize in the show very thin plot, expanding it with intellect, sense of humor and some profanity. Through the choreography, R. Ashford was able to recreate many dances of mid-1980s. During the Broadway premiere, tickets pre-sales were at $3 million-mark. Critics have variously estimated the production. Basically, they received the show well, although there were those who expected more from this piece. New composition resembled the songs of the 1980s, but still they were not them fully. Therefore, those who went to dip into the world of own youth and childhood, have been slightly disappointed. However, the creators managed to make the production pretty attractive., , The theatrical was 8 times nominated for Drama Desk. Also it was nominated for Drama League. The play received 5 nominations for Tony. At the end of the show in December 2006, over the 1 weekend have been received $889,596 dollars to the box office. This was the maximal amount they could receive for the nine-month running. , , Romantic comedy successfully survived the transfer to the stage. Due to the strong performers, show was saturated and bright. Some theatergoers have pointed out that Stephen Lynch could not completely withdraw himself from a role of comic actor. In addition, the singer did not look at the stage complete failure, striving to love, whose image has been so successfully embodied in the film by Adam Sandler. Both in the film and in the musical there are merits, but to fully understand them, you need to feel the 1980âs era with all your heart."
"419","West Side Story ","    The musical is an adaptation of the famous work of W. Shakespeare âRomeo and Julietâ. The first steps in the creation of production were taken in the late 1940's, when J. Robbins went to L. Bernstein and A. Laurents with the proposal on cooperation. It was assumed that in the modern adaptation of Shakespeare's play would be discussed the confrontation between the Catholic Irish people and the Jews. After creating the script, work on the musical was completely stopped. Several years later, the authors returned to their brainchild. At the same time, Stephen Sondheim joined the creative union. After appearance of messages of clashes between teenage gangs in the press, the founders decided to change the script, turned their attention from religious subjects to social events. Since A. Laurents was very well familiar with Puerto Rican immigrants living in the New York area, he suggested the use of their representatives instead of Mexicans. Jerome Robbins was delighted with the Latin rhythms of the future musical. , , In the production of the show, there were many difficulties. They hardly found the money and the producer â almost no one wanted to deal with such a dramatic story. Two months before the start of rehearsals, they were required to find another organizer. New producer was Hal Prince. He familiarized himself with the script and auditioned musical numbers. Cutting the budget off, producer, however, has allocated funds to hire a second choreographer. As planned by the Prince, in the show had to be far more dance numbers than the usual spectaculars of that time had. Immediately the question arose about the actors. It was necessary to find young actors who could not only sing, but also to do all the choreography. Realizing the importance of the future show, Prince gave to dance rehearsals twice more time than planned. Broadway premiere caused a huge furor. The audience immediately assessed the relevance of non-standard show. Critics have even recognized that the musical has become a new landmark in the history of theater. Appreciating the drama and tension of the play, the reviewers were of the opinion that the musical would become a model for the creation of the next shows. , , In 1961, after Broadwayâs production was filmed eponymous film starring Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer. For a long time, based on the original show new versions of the play were created. It was exhibited in many countries around the world. Broadway productions of different years were awarded with Tony, Theatre World, Grammy and Drama Desk awards. West End version of 2008 was twice nominated for Laurence Olivier. The musical has become a classic of its genre. Thanks to the energetic melodies and expressive dances, the performance was very popular with the audience."
"420","White Christmas ","    This theatrical was an adaptation of the eponymous film, shot by director Michael Curtiz in 1954. When creating a staging version, authors have tried to preserve a retro spirit in the show. Fancy special effects, colorful costumes and beautiful actors allowed taking the viewer to unforgettably hilarious place. Some critics felt the plot of the show was too simple and old-fashioned, but if you are not too demanding to the histrionics, you can find a charm in it. Production, held on Broadway for two months, experienced success, but for a longer stay on the stage, the show did not have enough charge of energy. In the future, interest to this musical woke up in the audience only on the Christmas Eve and on New Year, so the play appeared in theaters only in this period of time. , , In 2009, the Broadway show was 6 times nominated for the Drama Desk. It was also twice nominated for Tony Award. In Christmas week spectacular received the maximum cash charges of 1,588,859 dollars instead of the expected $ 1,433,203. At the end of the show, production has gained the minimum amount of money â $ 869,936. An updated Broadway version was mildly popular among viewers, although to a lesser extent than the previous versions. The maximum fees were earned in the first week after the premiere â 1,268,196 dollars with the expected amount of $ 1,711,485. In the last weekend of the musical, organizers received minimal revenue â 759,048 dollars., , Poet and composer Irving Berlin wrote more than 1,500 songs for his entire life. His magical and tremendous melodies are not outdated even many years after their creation. When showing the production, performers of the main roles had to compete with the images embodied by the famous actors Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye in the original motion picture. From the charisma and charm, as well as the vocal abilities of the leading artists depended much success of the entire play. Broadway show was not too pleasing to critics but the audience praised the work of Stephen Bogardus and Jeffry Denman at a high level. Subsequent tours also relished public. Some fans of the film were unhappy that producers excluded from the musical several songs and added other ones by I. Berlin. But even they noted the high skills of actors, who were able to create for the majority of the audience a festive mood on the eve of the upcoming Christmas. The show allows to hear the wonderful songs live and to see the great dance numbers."
"421","Who's Tommy","    At the heart of the theatrical is rock opera âTommyâ, represented by âThe Whoâ music band in 1969. Pete Townshend originally inclined to create compositions, united by a common plot. After the publication of his autobiography, he decided to start writing a rock opera. In the story about a boy, who became blind & deaf-mute due to trauma, many facts from the personal life of guitarist from âThe Whoâ were mentioned. Townshend asked bassist J. Entwistle to compose songs of child abuse, as he found it hard for him to write about this issue. When finished compositions were listened by critic Nik Cohn, he was not impressed with the quality of the material. When Pete Townshend found out that this critic was a fan of pinball & so he entered this game in the act & wrote a song about it. Later this song became a hit. Critics have called this rock opera one of the most daring albums of its time. âTommyâ was the most commercially successful project of âThe Whoâ band. In total, they sold nearly 20 million copies of it., , In 1975, after the album was shoot the same-named film, which had not cause big elation in critics. In 1993, was the premiere of the Broadwayâs musical. The revised performance was highly appreciated by the audience. It also received excellent reviews from the critics. Staging was awarded with numerous prizes. The show has won in 6 out of 7 categories in Drama Desk. It has also received 5 awards out of 6 nominations for the Outer Critics Circle Award. The theatrical was marked with Theatre World Award. It was nominated 11 times for Tony & won in 5 categories. Organizers received maximal box office for the weekend in the beginning of January 1994 â they amounted to 693,188 dollars. The minimum amount of $ 229,369 was received in June 1995 near the closure. According to critics, compositions by band The Who have not lost relevance in the XXI century too. A dynamic production never made the audience get bored while watching. The sound level was softened comparing with concerts of âThe Whoâ â it allowed the public to perceive lyrics without the auditory overload. The plot of the musical was different from the movie. In the show, the same as in the original rock opera, a crime commits not a lover, but the boy's father. Taking into account the family values of the 1990s, the finale of the play was done more optimistic. The unusual scenography by J. Arnone helped to convey to the audience the state of mind of the protagonist of the play in the best way. The dramatic show did not leave anyone indifferent. Musical encourages people to pay more attention to their surroundings & family, to try to change them for the better."
"422","Wicked ","    The cultural phenomenon and one of the most popular shows â that was the viewer's recognition, according to US magazine. Broadway version of âWickedâ, released in 2003, immediately divided critics into two irreconcilable camps. Some enthusiastically adopted all seen and heard, considering the show quite an extraordinary cultural event. Others looked at the performance gloomier. The last ones found it too clichÃ©d, and also considered libretto visibly muddled. But both not left without attention bright and very good quality of presenting the visual component, attracting audiences so much: light setting, expressive costumes, fancy makeup, well-done staging construction and the performersâ skills. , , Music in songs is really made in the best Broadway traditions, so in musical numbers truly guessed some clichÃ©s. But it seems that this is what most often expect to hear the vast majority of viewers in successful stage shows. Moreover, the author of music exactly wanted to achieve recognition of this fabulous story & its characters, deliberately repeating the melody from the film of 1939 and wished to build a musical performance by generally accepted canons. , , Some critics unflatteringly mentioned rectilinear images of two main characters, who allegedly overly deliberate show how the unusual person can easily transform from a good hero to villain under the circumstances. Wicked Witch has green skin; she is brunette. The Good Witch is a good-looking blonde to whom all sympathize, even when she behaves negatively. But for a show, understood charismatic main characters are likely the dignity, not a drawback., , Idina Menzel has become a true star thanks to this musical. Her green face was a matter of adoration by many people and because of her inimitable charm, she had become even more loved hero from a musical than her scenic collaborate, a Good Witch. She is like Anakin Skywalker, whom now everyone admires more than Luke. , , Vivid characters force to sympathize with everything happening. Viewers begin to empathize more to the negative character. In fact, she is almost the only positive person with an unbending will and a desire to save the situation in any way. Elphaba does nothing bad to anyone. The spoiled society rejects her only because of a skin color. She becomes undeserved outcast, a child deprived of attention and love. Eventually she humbles with her fate of Wicked Witch. Because of peopleâs hatred, her heart was petrified and she had no other choice but to meet the expectation of everyone â to behave like an evil person., , The audience loved the show from the very first days and the tickets for every show were always sold-out, proving its tremendous success. The musical was treated as a highly professional product, enjoying the soul, comprehensible to adults and children. Musical has to be festive and enchanting, and Wicked is exactly so. It still goes on a variety of different stages, winning the hearts of audiences in many countries."
"423","Wild Party ","    Thanks to a good book basis, the musical âThe Wild Partyâ has a strong plot. At the same time, there is nothing superfluous or unnatural â the characters are shown honest and unvarnished in their strengths and weaknesses. Director and music author were able accurately convey the direction of the beginning of the century, as evidenced by the awards and received reviews from critics., , The genre of the musical is suited the best for revelation of the main idea â to show the relationship of the actors in the vaudeville show format. That is why all the songs in stage numbers look quite organically and naturally. The viewer immediately immerses into the atmosphere of a wild party of 1920s and becomes a witness of how harmless regular festive evening of carefree youth can easily turn into a real tragedy., , Music makes it possible to feel the full palette of trends of the beginning of the century. Listeners will enjoy ballads and love songs, funny scenes and professional jazz compositions. A good laugh over the awkward situations of drunken heroes is guaranteed. Sensitive individuals will find what to cry about. In the end, there will be even some confusion on how deftly creators managed to cross the line between comedy and tragedy. They managed to turn the atmosphere of a mad holiday into a tragic story of a short but passionate love of creative people. Such characters are willing to live short, but bright. They do not like the drab routine. Fountain of emotions and feelings fits them most., , The music, following the scenic twists and turns, sometimes stops in the quiet sounds of ballads and sometimes falls upon the beholders with fervent tunes and dancing. Costumes and scenery are executed in the exact style of the time, looks very organic & memorable for a long time. It does not have a stunning gloss, scale and chic of âChicagoâ, for example. But it has a seclusion, as the viewer involuntarily placed on the role of sort of a spy on everything happening in this Manhattanâs apartment."
"424","Wildcat ","    Lucille Ball, known to viewers by starring in the American sitcom âI Love Lucyâ, was the leading actress of this original Broadway production. After she showed to this production not only creative, but also a financial interest, N. R. Nash slightly altered scenario in her favor. Initially Wildcat Jackson should not have been older than 31 years, but at the moment of the development, Lucille Ball was over 48 years old. Because of this, the age of the heroine had to be changed. The husband of the actress D. Arnaz invested into the production 360 thousand dollars. Instead, he bought 36% of the rights to net profit, which was to be received in the future, rights to songs & exhibition of the play on television. Before the premiere, Lucille Ball & Desi Arnaz had divorced. They have kept a good relationship with each other throughout the whole life. Thanks to new friend Paula Stewart, who played the role of Janie Jackson, Lucille Ball became acquainted with Gary Morton, who became her second husband in 1961., , Regional production of the musical received excellent reviews from Variety, but Philadelphia critics expressed much less enthusiasm about the new show. The premiere had to be shifted because the cars delivering sets & props in NY were stuck for a several days on the road due to strong blizzard. Spectators who came to the theater, wanted to look at the TV star, but not acting skills of Lucille Ball. Due to the severe schedule â 8 performances per week â the actress became seriously ill. She was not able to cope with chronic fatigue, illness & exhaustion in the future. Musical was removed from the display, without ever trying to find a replacement for the role of the protagonist. Critics have noted that when understudy for Lucille Ball was playing, staging looked faded, washy & uninteresting. In the following performances, this play was confirmed â only charisma of leading actress could fill the significant shortcomings of the storyline. According to the audience, music in the show partially compensated a weak story. The show included some great songs that the audience liked. Attempts to revive the play were done extremely rare. But it is obvious that if the world has an actress with not less fervent temperament than Lucille Ball has, this musical is created exactly for her. It only remains to find one, the same redheaded."
"425","Will Rogers Follies","    Showman-cowboy Will Rogers, whose biography was the basis of the musical, hardly remembered by anyone, even if it comes about famous actors of the 1920s. But at his time, the actor was very well known, having made a world tour, during which he was a virtuoso in stunting shows with a lasso. His show about Wild West was on Broadway for some time featuring artists from Ziegfeld Follies variety. After that, Will Rogers had a bright career on radio, where he broadcasted his radio show. A great success came to him in Hollywood â actor starred in 70 films! Rogers was a humorist and social commentator. He had his own column in the daily newspaper. The actor died in 1935 at age of 55 at the top of his popularity. The whole world mourned his departure from life then., , Broadway play about the life of Will was performed in the style of vaudeville show by Ziegfeld Follies with long-legged beauties. Because of this, narrative had become superficial, but thanks to the spectacular costumes, outstanding dancing and wonderful songs, such simplification was almost imperceptible. The musical necessarily had a large staircase, on which descended participants of the show. With the help of illumination, it shone with all the colors of the rainbow, not yielding to the brightness of the girlsâ outfits. Wedding scene looks very impressive, when at all stairs was lying an enormously long veil of the brideâs gown. Classic cowboy outfits and lush robes of Indians mixed with fantastic costumes in the style of a variety show, were created from feathers, fabrics and sequins. All the actors performing the role of Will Rogers had to know how to deal with lasso, as these skills were constantly involved in the show. , , The splendor and brilliance of the musical appreciated not only by the audience, but also by critics. The Broadway production was marked by many awards. It won 3 nominations out of 5 on Drama Desk. The play received the award as the best musical by NY Drama Critics' Circle. It was three times nominated for Outer Critics Circle. Production has won 6 out of 11 categories at Tony, also awarded as the best musical. Maximum box office for the weekend were received in December 1991 and amounted to 588,483 dollars. The minimum amount per week â $ 173,403 â organizers received in mid-April 1991., , The production is steeped with classic American spirit, which is known all over the world. Enchanting spectacle was reminiscent of the original show of Ziegfeld Follies. It contained political jokes that were shifted to modern realities. The story of cowboy-philosopher has been shown through the prism of show business, which added effects to life of Will Rogers."
"426","Wiz","    With each new production, this show stayed fresh and modern, showing the audience a unique music culture of African Americans. The main librettoâs idea was to believe in yourself. Only then, you can achieve everything youâve ever wanted., , The plot of the spectacular is virtually identical to the bookâs basis, and that is why it will be equally interesting to both adults and children from around the world, who have read a book. Well-organized advertising campaign at the time has helped to make this performance welcome before the release, and then to achieve box-office success with the audience. Changing all the time its inner compositions according to musical trends of times, regular update of choreography and set design gave it the right to life virtually forever, as long as the tickets will be sold-out, as it has unconditional love of the audience., , The very basis of the book as if was asking to appear on theatrical stage. It has the ability to show sorcery and magic, optical effects, glowing Emerald City, the wizard-magicians, terrible tornado that ruined a house of the main character and so on. And the proof of that â the existence even of a few musicals, all of which are based on the book by Frank Baum âThe Wonderful Wizard of Ozâ. But only one of them was originally adapted to the African-American culture, allowing lovers to become better acquainted with it. And this is âThe Wizâ, giving the audience in the movie version the debut of young Michael Jackson as the Scarecrow with incredible plasticity. It also revealed us 33-year-old Diana Ross with special angular movements as Dorothy-teenager, and comedian Richard Pryor, played a part of Wizard of Oz., , All critics, without exception, spoke positively about every production of the play, including its film and theater version. In each country where it was running, it had nice success. , , What is important that, in addition to the fact of well-calculated commercial component and great music, passionate dances and straight content, this performance raises a very important social theme: if you believe in something and pursue it, then you will, for sure, achieve it. And you will not need witchcraft or magic. If you have friends, each of which could not be that strong himself or herself, forming a team together, you will be able to achieve much more goals that you could, being loners. About it sings the Good Witch Glinda in the final part of the performance. To this thought comes the main character, who found her friends in a dreamland. Each one of them was able to achieve the desired goals, without resorting to the wizardry. And even the Wiz wasnât a wizard, but was a good professional illusionist and politician â which is also important in life."
"427","Wizard Of Oz","    Fans of Broadway children's classics âThe Wizard Of Ozâ will love it. Of course, it can capture the imagination of adult beholders too. Many critics agreed that the visual components, the design of the castle of the Wicked Witch, scenography of Oz, the tricks of The Wizard would remain in the memory for a long time. , , Considering many changes made over more than a century of its existence on the stage, the stylistics of the modern musical play is almost perfect. With all its brightness and effectiveness, it is more like a spectacle, where there are not only fantastical numbers, but also magic tricks, embedded music, lyrics, and fancy dialogues. Everything that happens on stage is seen very much alive, design of costumes and scenery strike imagination. , , As for the music part, some of the critics were directed towards the homogeneity of musical themes, not giving the opportunity to the audience to experience a rich palette of emotions and feelings while watching the show. However, in the latter versions, in which invested their efforts Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, this is hardly noticeable. Musical supplemented with many new songs, arrangements, introduced additional characters. It had complicated at first rather simple main plot, making it much more interesting. Yes, it was not so dramatic, but it gives food for thought. After all, it is clearly understood that it is not the Wizard who grants wishes, but the heroes were able to achieve everything themselves. , , We must understand that unlike the musical âThe Wizâ with the same basis for the book (where all the actors are African Americans), which showcases the fiery jazz and African-American musical culture, The Wizard Of Oz is a classic Broadway musical variant of the immortal works of L. F. Baum. Due to worldwide fame of Baumâs novel, excerpts from this musical are often staged in school by students. Every year more and more people take the stage for this show."
"428","Woman In White ","    In contrast to the critics, the audience unanimously warm received a new musical. But its success was not that long â a year and a half on the British scene and three months on Broadway. Since 2013, there are rumors about its resurrection, but until now, the work wasnât started yet. Most likely, the fall of the interest of the public for more than ten years ago was affected by three things., , First, this spectacular was a theatrical adaptation of well-known major British detective novel. Moreover, this novel was with some mystical component and with a difficult approach in the presentation of the context. The musicalâs narration was straightforward. There was no need to viewer to think out of the plot and to put puzzles into the single picture. Not everyone liked these innovations occurred for simplification. The basic idea was fully preserved, though delivered differently. It is the film adaptations, which more likely to cause contradictory audienceâs success. Some people are willing to accept the brought novelty. Others may consider it blasphemy in relation to the author of the book., , Secondly, Michael Crawfordâs beginning of the act in his famous fat suit in the role of Count Fosco was forced to cancel his participation due to illness. He was replaced by not so eminent actor. Maria Friedman was also absents at the time of his illness, and play sometimes was left without the two main stars-performers., , Thirdly, not all viewers perceived three-dimensional images as real ones. Many noted that staging was not too synchronized with actors from all angles of the hall, and that is why they constantly were perceived as pictures, rather than the real things., , The spectacular is worth viewing for every classic lover and fan of musicals by A. Lloyd-Webber. Fans of Maria Friedman will see something new & unusual in the classical interpretation. The play has a very interesting stage design: instantly changing scenery and noteworthy three-dimensional cylindrical screen. Excellent costumes, reverent attitude to repel the depicted era also demand respect. During previews, from the musical show have been removed all the points that were perceived badly, were not heard or difficult to see in the large hall. So the basic play, submitted to the public, was well-verified product of the entertainment industry, and part of the soul of creators., , Work continued for 2 years. The authors have adapted the novel for the stage. As a result, it turned out only singing, without dialogues between the characters is the accompaniment. The prologue was interspersed with the idea of Charles Dickens about a switchman. On the main roles were invited stars Maria Friedman and Michael Crawford."
"429","Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown ","    The criticâs reviews concerning this musical were different. We cannot call it unsuccessful, but the tickets sales started to fall by the end of the season. This was the reason why the show closed earlier than it had been planned. But the production is still interesting to watch, as it managed to capture the spirit of the original movie and to create the special mood., , The actorsâ work is magnificent. The leading actress Sherie Rene Scott made her best in transferring emotions to the spectators. One of the most striking was the role, played by Patti LuPone. This Tony Award winner with bright blond hair managed to create a perfect image of the woman, who had spent some time in the asylum. Her voice also deserves the attention of the viewers. Her tenor is beautiful and extremely strong. For one of the two men in this production, it was a debut. Justin Guarini â a runner up of the American Idol first season â played on Broadway for the first time., , The director â Bartlett Sher â is the one, who has made a really great job. He is well known for his revival of South Pacific, which has brought him Tony and Drama Desk Awards. Critics from the New York Times called the production distracted and having lack of completeness, as everything was moving too fast. But it is still charming enough to be adored by the audience. The spectacle reflects its characters, who were desperately looking for love. It is also an outstanding adaptation of a popular film, created by P. AlmodÃ³var as an embodiment of romantic anarchy., , Songs are mesmerizing. D. Yazbek is a talented composer and songwriter. It was his third work for Broadway, and it appeared to be marvelous as usual. His compositions help to create special mood and understand the characters much better. The duets are funny, but also gorgeous. Together with fantastic voices of the actors, they turn this musical into a harmonious unity. Some of the songs are just funny, but the others are unexpectedly soulful. , , As for the costume design, some critics are sure itâs too much. But they also complete the image of 1988 Madrid and the passion of love. The style might seem too strange, it was even called full of novelties. But clothes help to transfer the mood and tastes of the heroes. The decorations are minimalistic, but they are not that necessary, as the characters are bright enough to make the required atmosphere., , The dances do not make the greatest part of the show, but they complete the image as well. By means of them we can find out what the heroes feel, and to understand their temperament. Thatâs why Christopher Gattelli made his best as a choreographer here., , This production is a mixture of artificial visuals, serious and sincere feelings and emotions. Here you can find something to cry and something to laugh at. The musical is very energetic. If you want to be filled with strong emotions â you should watch this unusual Broadway spectacle. Get ready for extravaganza, mixed with tears and hopes for the future!"
"430","Wonderful Town ","    This musical is a vivid example of the performances of the 1950-ies. Light, lively, with a witty sense of humor and a happy ending. It can be safely called a classic of American musicals. Therefore, it has stayed so popular fifty years later. Jazz music by legendary composer Leonard Bernstein perfectly conveys the mood of each scene., , The story of two sisters, who came from the provinces, and caught by a whirlpool of adventures, is unpretentious, but fun and easy. It seems that the heroes of the show are never sad, and do not lose their hearts. Even the atmosphere in the prison is no different from a nightclub. And Brazilian carnival dances only add enchanting effect. , , For those who love crowded scenes with songs and dances, the rapid succession of events, shift of bright costumes, the atmosphere of light-heartedness and fun â must see this beautiful musical. Probably, the fifties are considered golden age of musicals. After their revival in our days, they have the same success and interest of the audience. It is a good option for viewing with friends in a big company â the perfect mood is guaranteed. , , The musical Wonderful Town had won all nominations of Tony in 1953, namely: best musical of the year, the best performance of the title role â R. Russell, best choreography â D. Saddler, best conductor & musical director â L. Engel, best stage design â R. Du Bois. E.

"431","Wonderland Alice's New Musical Adventure ","    After Tampa production, the reviews were mixed. The critics noticed plenty of positive moments, such as dances, costumes, popular songs, but there was still one important disadvantage â the musical had no sense. Some of them even claimed that the show should be rewritten in a proper way. Particular scenes and characters appeared to be preposterous, such as meeting with Carroll and the Hatter. As the critics think, the creators have tried to add more depth to the story, but they failed. , , Broadways production also had quite negative reviews. But one of the New York Times critics called it energetic, inspirational and full of humor. Thatâs why we cannot say that this production has been absolutely unsuccessful., , The viewers also liked the spectacle, and this is the most important thing. The ticket sales were strong, and another international tour is planned, so we can expect some more positive reception both from the critics and the audience. , , Looking at the positive moments of the staging, we should mention the projection design, which has been made by Sven Ortel. He managed to create a real image of a Wonderland. Together with Paul Galloâs lighting and Neil Patelâs sets, the decorations look just magnificent. The spectators might seem to be in a real fairy-tale., , We cannot forget about the outstanding compositions, created by Frank Wildhorn and Jack Murphy. Wildhorn is a great composer, who has been creating melodies for musicals and popular songs for many years. He was also the author of internationally popular W. Houston song. He is well known for his works for Jekyll and Hyde show as well. No doubt that the music for this production appeared to be the same marvelous and memorable., , Gregory Boyd, who was not only the director, but also a co-author of the musical, did a great job. He mixed all this brightness and craziness into a single whole. The actors are perfectly selected. The characters are fantastically colorful and the performers were able to transfer their mood, emotions and inner state. The role of the Hatter is both evil and delicious. Kate Shindle is just a perfect choice for this character. The songs, performed by her, prove that. As for her visual look, the critics called he? a glowering vamp. Darrin Ritchie reflects the image of a Disney prince, who saves everyone and sacrifices himself. Telling about Janet Dacal, her image reflects the place she has come from. While the costumes of all the other characters are so-called extraordinary and exotic, she looks quite usual. She stands out of the general madness of this world. Her acting is the same, she shows that she is from the other place and we cannot understand what she is doing here. , , Concerning choreography, the musical is successful. It was even nominated for Astaire Award in this category. So, Marguerite Derricks created a nice thing. There is probably no need to search for a deep sense in this performance. There are lots of other to admire here. If you want to see something bright and outstanding, this staging is what you require."
"432","Working ","    The musical is based on the bestselling work by Studs Terkel, written on the basis of many his interviews with people from the USA.

Many reviewers did not like the pattern, manifested in the lyrics of compositions. Despite the fact that at the core of each song was the real story of a person, it did not help the creators of the show to avoid the stereotypes of the image of this or that profession. In 1978, the Broadway production was 6 times nominated for Tony. The musical won in 2 of 6 categories in Drama Desk. , , Director Gordon Greenberg, who participated along with Stephen Schwartz in the development of a new version of the play, got acquainted with the production in the age of 13. Being in the famous theaterâs camp Stagedoor Manor, aspiring young actor played the role of an adolescent-newspaperman. The performance made a strong impression on him, under the influence of which in the future director began to create his own version of the show. Eight-year work on the musical was completed in 2008. Composer and poet Lin-Manuel Miranda was also attracted to the renewal of production, writing two songs. According to Stephen Schwartz, vigorous energy of the young author added more to the spectacleâs sensitivity. The show's creators took into account current factors affecting the increase in unemployment and the emergence of new professions. Critics noted that the updated version had smooth and natural changes between the numbers, in contrast to the one of previous years. The meaning of this musical will never become obsolete, since the work will always bring people suffering and joy."

Beane said that while adapting the libretto for a play, he was impressed by fiction film âClash of the Titansâ, which contributed to the appearance in the show malicious sister-muses and angry thunderer Zeus. The main role was planned for Jane Krakowski, but after participating in pre-production, she refused to cooperate further, due to her workload in TV shots.

Musicalâs production in 2010 coincided with the political debates and the abolition of the law âDo not Ask, Do not Tellâ, which forbade Americans to serve in the army, if they openly admitted their own homosexuality.

"439","Zanna, Don't ","    During the creation of this musical, Tim Acito was a newcomer to the writer's career. Former touring performer of the modern dance only recently has finished his career to do literary work. Inventing a musical about an unusual universe with homosexual people, the author called it Zanna Donât, inspired by âXanaduâ. Tim Acito wanted the protagonist moved on rollers, decided to give a tribute to the most iconic picture, but later the idea had to be abandoned. The main message of the show was â to show sincerity and warmth of genuine feelings through social satire. The music pieces you can hear are: rock, funk, pop genre, and even fragments of classical music. Jack M. Dalgleish saw this production in New Havenâs Yale Cabaret in March 2001. Assessing the sturdy foundation of idea of the unusual universe, he called the author of the play. Producer T. Acito offered to do rework the show into a full musical, sensing the future progress.

"440","Zombie Prom ","    The musical is based on a story by John Dempsey and Hugh Murphy. The action in the show takes place in 1950ies. The satirical show includes parodies on pop melodies and sentimental ballads. Despite rather pleasant rhythms, music performance does not stand out from the sounds of other similar spectacles. The retro-focus of the staging has allowed the organizers to use fashion and style of 50ies at the best. Bright green makeup applied to create the image of a zombie, suited more for a super-hero like Hulk, rather than to the embodiment of the living dead. Some critics regretted that the organizers of the show decided not to show in the course of the play stronger decay marks appearing on Jonnyâs body. According to them, the musical would only benefit from this dismal picture. The theatrical is often produced by school and small theater troupes.

Featuring a subculture of young people of that time, the authors were not able to convey fully the emotions and joy of life of their characters. Plot disadvantages overlapped by the presence of great artists involved in the production. Jessica Snow Wilson had beautiful vocal data â she played the role of Toffee. Comedic talent of Karen Murphy must also be noted, which was embodied in the image of the principal Delilah Strict. The audience was thrilled by the acting of this actress. According to the reviewers, Richard Roland could show own character more impressively â but the artist has created only a classic image of the monster, forgetting to add to it a pile of emotions, which led to a revival of the dead lover. Filmed 30-minute film based on this plot had a success with the audience. Though, it had some shortcomings â for example, simple inconsistency of the color skin of principal and Jonny (black and white). In 2015, Steve Longi and Michael J. Roth purchased the rights to the musical to create a full-fledged film. The script will be developed by Mark Landry and Vince Marcello. The appearance of a new film will attract public interest to this theatrical production and maybe even will result in the new full-capacity musical on Broadway."
