No one saying be there

Kings don't need advice 
From little hornbills for a start

Everybody look right

Oh, he just can't wait to be king!

Just can't wait...
Zazu, why am I not loved?
I am that rare and awesome thing
I'm every inch a king
Yet I feel a twinge of doubt
As I go walk about

Hey, boss!

When my name is whispered through the pride
Is this talk of love or regicide?

Reggie who?

Tell me I'm adored
Please tell me I'm adored

Hey, boss!

Oh, what is it?

We got a bone to pick with you

There's no food, no water--

Yeah. It's dinnertime, and there ain't no
stinkin' entrees!

Oh, you and your petty complaints. You don't know what real hunger is. 
Day after day it gnaws at the very core of my being

I had that once. It was worms

No, no, no... it's like an itch... deep, persistent, profound...

That's it-- worms! When they get really bad all you gotta do is... hunker
down and scoot

Thanks for the tip. Ingrates! If it weren't for me you'd be beating off
buzzards for your next bite! 

Yeah, you're our savior, thanks a bunch
But how about some lunch?
It doesn't matter if it's fresh
I need a fix of flesh
My bones have moved to where they've never been
They are on the outside looking in

Are you blaming me?

Oh no, it's the lionesses

You are so adored
Oh, you are so adored

That's more like it

But what I'd give for one more hit
Of wildebeest kielbasa
Or maybe hornbill on the spit...

Oh, how I miss Mufasa

Mufasa?! Mufasa?! How dare you! I told you never to mention that name! 

Note taken. I shall never mention "M-m-m" again

Even in death, his shadow looms over me
There he is!
No! There he is!
And there!

Calm yourself, Sire, or you'll get another one of your splitting
headaches! 

I am perfectly fine!
I'm better than Mufasa was
I'm revered
I am reviled
I'm idolized
I am despised
I'm keeping calm
I'm going wild!

I tell myself I'm fine
Yes I am, no you're not
Yes I am, no you're not
I tell myself I'm fine

No you're not, yes I am, no you're not
Yes I am
No you're not
Yes, no, yes, no, who am I talking to...?

Oh, pull yourself together, Sire!

Oh, very well. Zazu? Zazu, Zazu, Zazu...?

Yes, Sire?

Nobody loved me, there's the rub, not even as a cub
What did my brother have that I don't have?

Do you want the short list or the long?

Whatever!

Well, he had adoring subjects... a loving family... a devoted queen... 

That's it! I need a queen!

A what?

A queen, man! A queen! Without a queen, what am I? A dead end, no line, no
descendants, no future. With a queen, I'll have cubs... Immortality will
be mine! Immortality will be mine!

Scar

Ah, Nala... Your timing couldn't have been more perfect. My how you've
grown

Scar, you have got to do something. We're being forced to overhunt

She's got those assets feminine

You're the king. Control the hyenas

I have to make her mine

You're destroying the Pridelands

Nobility in every gene

If we don't stop now.. Don't you see...

She has to be my queen

...there's still a chance for things to be all right again... 

Come, sweet Nala
It's written in the stars

What are you doing? Are you listening to me?

We'll create a host of little Scars

What are you talking about?

Tell me I'm adored

Get away from me

Tell me I'm adored
Oh, Nala... you know how I loathe violence... One way or another, you will
be mine

Never, Scar. Never!

You belong to me
You all belong to me



Fatshe leso lea halalela	[The land of our ancestors is holy]
Fatshe leso lea halalela

Shadowland
The leaves have fallen
This shadowed land
This was our home

The river's dry
The ground has broken
So I must go
Now I must go

And where the journey may lead me
Let your prayers be my guide
I cannot stay here, my family
But I'll remember my pride

Prideland	I have no choice
My land	I will find my way
Tear-stained	Lea halalela
Dry land
Take this	Take this prayer
With you	What lies out there
Fatshe leso	Lea halalela

And where the journey may lead you
Let this prayer be your guide
Though it may take you so far away
Always remember your pride

Fatshe leso lea halalela
Fatshe leso lea halalela	Fatshe leso lea halalela

And where the journey may lead you
Let this prayer be your guide
Though it may take you so far away
Always remember your pride

And where the journey may lead you	Giza buyabo, giza buyabo
Let this prayer be your guide	I will return, I will return
Beso bo
Though it may take you so far away	Giza buyabo, I will return
Always remember your pride	Giza buyabo, oh giza buyabo

Beso bo, my people, beso bo


I can see what's happening	What?
And they don't have a clue	Who?
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line
Our trio's down to two.	Oh.

The sweet caress of twilight
There's magic everywhere
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air

Can you feel the love tonight
The peace the evening brings
The world for once in perfect harmony
With all its living things

So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past, impossible
She'd turn away from me

He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is?
The king I see inside?

Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are

And if he feels the love tonight
In the way I do

It's enough for this restless wanderer

Just to be with you
