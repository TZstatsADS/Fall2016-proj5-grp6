t's dawned on me suddenly
And for no obvious reason
That I can't go on
Living as I am

The zest of life has vanished 
Only the skeleton remains
Unexpectedly vile
I used to be better
I drank too much
Right now, my friend fights and bleeds
And I sit at home and read
Hours at a time
Hours at my screen
Anything, anything
Abandoned to distraction
In order to forget
We waste our lives
Drowning in wine

I never thought that I'd end up like this
I used to better

And the women they all pity me
Cuz I'm married
But not in love
Frozen at the center

There's a ringing in my head
There's a sickness in the world
And everyone knows
But pretends that they don't see
?Oh, I'll sort it out later?
But later never comes

Entered that door
With all their teeth and hair
And left it toothless and bald

You empty and stupid
Contented fellows
Satisfied with your place
I'm different from you
I'm different from you
I still want to do something

Or do you struggle too?
I pity you, I pity me, I pity you
I pity you, I pity me, I pity you



Yes. How was the opera?


Oh, oh that charming young girl?
I have known her since she was a child
And long carried affection for her

I will come
The doctors warn me


What?
What can they want with me?

(He arrives at Marya D.'s)

I have been studying

Marya?

What?
What?

What?

Natasha, that charming girl?
I can't believe my ears
So I am not the only man
Tied to a bad woman
And Anatole, that stupid child
They'll lock him up for years
For Anatole is a married man!

Yes
Poor Andrey
At once




Anatole, find Anatole
Anatole, find Anatole
The blood rushes to my heart
It's difficult to breathe
Anatole, find Anatole
Anatole, find Anatole
Not at the ice hills
Not at the gypsies'
Not at Komoneno's
Anatole, find Anatole
Anatole, find Anatole
To the Club

And at the Club all is going on as usual
The members eat their dinners
And gossip in small groups


Nonsense, nonsense
Nothing has happened
Everything is fine

I will not greet you
At this moment you are more repulsive to me than ever 

Anatole, come Anatole
Anatole, must speak to you

You promised Countless Rostova to marry her and were about to elope, is that so?

My face, already pale
Becomes distorted by fury
I seize you by the collar with my big big hands 
And I shake you from side to side
Until your face shows a sufficient degree of terror
When I tell you I must talk to you!

You're a scoundrel and a blackguard
And I don't know what deprives me of the pleasure
Of smashing your head in with this!

(He takes a heavy paperweight and lifts it threateningly, but at once puts it back in its place)

Did you promise to marry her?

Have you any letters of hers?
Any letters?

I shan't be violent, don't be afraid


First, the letters
Second, tomorrow you must get out of Moscow

But how can I?

Third
You must never breathe a word of what has happened between you and the Countess
Now I know I can't prevent your doing so
But if you have a spark of conscience

Pierre paces the room several times in silence

After all, you must understand
That besides your pleasure
There is such a thing as other people, and their happiness and peace 
And that you are ruining a whole life
For the sake of amusing yourself!
Amuse yourself with women like my wife
With them you're within your rights
But to promise a young girl to marry her
To deceive, to kidnap
Why don't you understand that that's as cruel as beating an old man or a child?

Is it satisfaction you want?

Fine I take them back, I take them back!
And I ask you to forgive me
And if you require money for your journey -

Oh, vile and heartless brood!

There's a new wrinkle
On your forehead old friend
My friend, you are in need
Your face is gloomy

Natasha is ill
She has been at death's door

And he smiled like his father
Coldly, maliciously

You told me once
A fallen woman should be forgiven


Natasha was standing
In the middle of the drawing room
With a pale yet steady face
When I appeared in the doorway
She grew flustered and I hurried to her
I thought that she would give me her hand
But instead she stopped
Breathing heavily
Her thin arms hanging lifelessly
Just in the very pose
She used to stand in as a young girl
When she went to the middle of the ballroom to sing
But the look on her face was quite different



Pierre sniffed as he looked at her, but he didn't speak
Till then he had reproached her, and tried to despise her
But now he felt such pity for her
That there was no room in his soul for reproach 


Yes, I will tell him to forgive you
But, he gave me your letters-

Yes I will tell him, tell him everything
But-
But I should like to know one thing
Did you love-
Did you love that bad man?

She began to cry
And a greater sense of pity, tenderness, and love overflowed Pierre's heart
He felt the tears begin to trickle underneath his spectacles 
And he hoped that no one would see

We won't speak of it anymore
We won't speak of it, my dear
But one thing I beg of you, consider me your friend
And if you ever need help, or simply to open your heart to someone
Not now, but your mind is clear
Think of me-

Pierre grew confused

Stop, stop, stop!

You have your whole life before you-

And restraining tears of tenderness
Tears of joy that choke me
I throw my fur coat on my shoulders
Unable to find the sleeves

Outside, my great broad chest
Breathes in deep the air with joy
Despite the ten degrees of frost

And I get my sleigh 

Where to now?
Where can I go now?
Not to the Club
Not to pay calls

Mankind seems so pitiful 
So poor
Compared to that softened, grateful, last glance
She gave me through her tears

This vast firmament
Open to my eyes
Wet with tears
The comet said to portend
Untold horrors
And the end of the world

But for me
The comet brings no fear
No, I gaze joyfully

And this bright star
Having traced its parabola
With inexpressible speed
Through immeasurable space
Seems suddenly
To have stopped
Like an arrow piercing the earth
Stopped for me

It seems to me
That this comet
Feels me
Feels my softened and uplifted soul
And my newly melted heart
Now blossoming
Into a new life 
Pierre closed the door and addressed Anatole without looking at him
That with my corpulence
Vodka and wine are dangerous for me

But I drink a great deal
Only quite at ease
After pouring several glasses
Mechanically into my large mouth
Don't speak to me, wife
There is something inside me

Something terrible and monstrous 

How dare you touch her?

Enough! 
You bully, you scoundrel!
I challenge you!
So I shall be killed!
What is it to you!
Anatole, my guns

Just show me where to go
And tell me when to shoot

My turn

Missed
Missed
Such a storm of feelings

Ah, Anatole! Where are you off too?

Ha! An elopement!
Fool, you are married already!

Ah, that's a true sage
Living in the moment
What I wouldn't give to be like him!
