When I was a tiny tot 
Of maybe two or three
I can still remember what
My mother said to me...

Place rose colored glasses on your nose
And you will see the robins
Not the crows 

For in the tense and tangled web
Our weary lives can weave
You're so much better off
If you believe...

That there's a little bit of good
In everyone
In everyone you'll ever know

Yes, there's a little bit of good
In everyone
Though many times, it doesn't show

It only takes a taking time 
With one another
For under every mean veneer
Is someone warm and dear 
Keep looking...

For that bit of good in everyone
The ones you call bad
Are never all bad
So try to find that little bit of good

Just a little, little bit of good

Is someone warm and dear
Keep looking...

For that little good in everyone
Although you meet rats
They're not complete rats
So try to find that little bit of good!

A convent girl! A run-away marriage! Oh, it's too terrible. 
You poor, poor dear.
Understandable, understandable
Yes, it's perfectly understandable
Comprehensible, comprehensible
Not a bit reprehensible
It's so defensible!
