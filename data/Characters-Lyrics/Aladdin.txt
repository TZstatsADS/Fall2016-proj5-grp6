One Jump Ahead 

Gotta keep
One jump ahead of the breadline
One swing ahead of the sword
I steal only what I can't afford
( That's Everything! )
One jump ahead of the lawmen
That's all, and that's no joke
These guys don't appreciate I'm broke
Just a little snack, guys
I can take a hint, gotta face the facts
I can use a friend or two!
Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
Tell you all about it when I got the time!
One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom 
Next time gonna use a nom de plume
One jump ahead of the hitmen
One hit ahead of the flock
I think I'll take a stroll around the block
Let's not be too hasty
Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
Otherwise we'd get along
One jump ahead of the hoofbeats
(Vandal!)
One hop ahead of the hump
(Street rat!)
One trick ahead of disaster
(Scoundrel!)
They're quick, but I'm much faster
(Take that!)
Here goes, better throw my hand in
Wish me happy landin'
All I gotta do is jump

Proud of Your Boy 


I'm gonna become somebody
I don't know how exactly, but I am
I have to...somehow
Proud of your boy 
I'll make you proud of your boy 
Believe me, bad as I've been, Ma 
You're in for a pleasant surprise 
I've wasted time 
I've wasted me 
So say I'm slow for my age 
A late bloomer, Okay, I agree 
That I've been one rotten kid 
Some son, some pride and some joy 
But I'll get over these lousin' up 
Messin' up, screwin' up times 
You'll see, Ma, now comes the better part 
Someone's gonna make good 
Cross his stupid heart 
Make good and finally make you 
Proud of your boy 
Tell me that I've been a louse and loafer 
You won't get a fight here, no ma'am 
Say I'm a goldbrick, a good-off, no good 
But that couldn't be all that I am 
Water flows under the bridge 
Let it pass, let it go 
There's no good reason that you should believe me 
Not yet, I know but... 
Someday and soon 
I'll make you proud of your boy 
Though I can't make myself taller 
Or smarter or handsome or wise 
I'll do my best, what else can I do ? 
Since I wasn't born perfect like Dad or you 
Mom, I will try to 
Try hard to make you 
Proud of your boy 

A Million Miles Away

Have you ever imagined what it'd be like to take off, and never look back?
What's stopping us?
We'll join a caravan tonight,
Count on the stars to be our guides.
We'll simply vanish out of sight,
Go where the dessert road decides.
There won't be any obligations
'Cause we'll be a million miles away,
Leave everything behind.
When you choose to loose yourself,
Who knows what you might find.
And once the journeys done,
You'll have some faith in me.
After a million miles or so, 
We might feel like we're free.

Ah ha! I'll tend the sails, and you can steer.
And the horizon disappear.
'Cause we'll be a million miles away,
Leave everything behind.
When you choose to loose yourself,
Who knows what you might find.
And once the journeys done,
It won't seem quite so far.
After a million miles or so,
We'll find out who we are.
A million miles away.
The kind of a life people dream of knowing.
We'll never turn back,
Just keep on going.
Vanishing from view,
Becoming someone new.
We'll be a million miles away,
Leave everything behind.
When you choose to loose yourself,
Who knows what you might find.
And once the journeys done,
We'll have no need to roam. 
After a million miles or so,
We might find out we're home.
After a million miles or so,
We might find out we're home. 


Diamond in the Rough
Hey I'm no diamond in the rough
Uhhh, I dunno guys, I've got a funny feeling about this.
I better just be on my way.
You better find somebody else!
Which way is this cave of yours?
Well it's a risk that I might have to take
Uhh, it is I, Aladdin
I don't believe it
My mother always said if I only applied myself - If I only believed!
Wish me luck!



Friend Like Me
Good! Scotty-wop
Everybody! Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo

A Whole New World 

You must feel trapped inside these walls
We'll run away, just you and me
Why not escape as evening falls?
Theres a whole world you've yet to see
Sure...Do you trust me? 
Do you trust me?
I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?
I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
Now I'm in a whole new world with you
Don't you dare close your eyes
Hold your breath, it gets better
A whole new world
With new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you
Don't you dare close your eyes
Hold your breath, it gets better
A whole new world
With new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you
A whole new world
That's where we'll be
A thrilling chase...
Both
For you and me

Somebody's Got Your Back
Be my guest!
You save me

I won't bail a 23 Skidoo
Say ain't it great to know somebody's got your back

Our bond will last like Mutt and Jeff's
OMG the guys are BFFs!
Say ain't it great to know that somebody's got your back!
It's give and take!
It takes some tact
We gonna divvy things up
I down with that
If "Poof, Ka-Blam"

It's part of Genie Genie-ology!
We don't do tricks
Like Genies do
But we got your back
And sing back up too!
Sayin' ain't it great to know that somebody's got your
Ain't it great to know that somebody's got your
Ain't it great to know that somebody's got your
Baaaack!
