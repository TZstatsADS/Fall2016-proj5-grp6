You must call me Natasha
My cheeks are glowing from the cold

Sofia Alexandrovna

Cousin dear I love you
Trust no one but you
But I can't bear this waiting
I cry and I cry
Audrey where are you?
I want him now, at once
To embrace him and cling to him
No one can understand

I love him
I know him
He loves me only
He'll come home one day
And take me away
I want nothing more
I want nothing more

Hmmm...
I blush happily


I know they'll like me
They can't help but like me
Everyone has always like me
His father, my Andrey's father
His sister, my Andrey's sister
There in no reason for them not to like me

Are the Prince and Princess at home?

Hello
I'm sorry the Price is still ailing
I am not afraid of anyone

But such hesitation
Such unnatural manners

And from the first glance I do not like Princess Mary
Too plain and affected
Insolent and dry
I shrink into myself
Assume an offhand air

I must take my leave

Is that the truth?
I think it is not convenient to speak of that now
Dear Princess
Though I felt tears choking me

What have I said, what have I done?
Crying like a child
Oh, they were so awful!
Oh, it all hurts so terribly


The moon -
First time I heard your voice
Moonlight burst into the room
And I saw your eyes
And I saw your smile 
And the world opened wide 
And the world was inside of me 

And I catch my breath
And I laugh and blush 
And I hear guitars
You are so good for me

I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you

Oh the moon
Oh the snow in the moonlight
And your childlike eyes
And your distant smile
I'll never be this happy again 
You and I
And no one else

We've done this all before
We were angels once
Don't you remember?
Joy and life
Inside our souls
And nobody knows
Just you and me
It's our secret

This winter sky
How can anyone sleep?
There was never such a night before!
I feel like putting my arms round my knees
And squeezing tight as possible
And flying away
Like this...

Oh the moon
Oh the snow in the moonlight
And your childlike eyes
And your distant smile
I'll never be this happy again
You and I
You and I
You and I
And no one else

Maybe he'll come today
Maybe he came already
And he's sitting in the drawing room
And I simply forgot


He is sensible and simple
Bold and natural,
So strange and agreeable
There is nothing formidable 
His smile is most na√Øve,
Cheerful and good-natured
And he's as handsome up close as at a distance
And he's as handsome up close as at a distance
Oh - 
Oh I - 
I know for certain that he is taken by me
I know for certain that he is enraptured by me
I feel him looking at my shoulders
My face, my neck, my bare arms

And looking into his eyes
I am frightened
There's not that barrier of modesty 
I've always felt with men
I feel so terribly near
I fear that he may seize me from behind
And kiss me on the neck

How do you like Moscow?
Yet I feel closer to you than I've ever felt with any other man
No one else is here
No one else can see us
Your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes
Oh your eyes
And I -
I cannot speak
Has Andrey arrived?
Has Andrey arrived?
He has not arrived
He will never come
Or something will happen to me before he does

I suffer more now than before
The theater and Anatole
That man who aroused such terrible feelings
I don't understand
Have I broken faith with Andrey? 
Am I guilty?

That terrible old Prince
I can't bear to think of it
I'll shut myself in my room
And try on new dresses

What once seemed so terrible
Now seems simple and natural
She knows I'm engaged
And still she talks so frankly
So it must be all right!
I will come


I am seized by feelings of vanity and fear
There is no barrier between us
Whispers and moans and ringing in my ear
There is no barrier between us
Divine, delicious
But I do not see or hear anything
I'm borne away to a senseless world
So strange, so remote
I don't know good from bad
Anatole
Anatole
I'm so frightened


And as we danced he pressed my waist and hand 
And told me I was 

And during the ecossaise, he

My frightened eyes

Such confident tenderness 
I could not say what I had to say

Don't say such things
I am betrothed
I love another

I'm so frightened
I don't understand anything tonight

I can feel your eyes upon me

His large, glittering, masculine eyes are so close to mine
That I see nothing else
You press my arm
You press my arm
You're hurting my hands
I don't understand
I have nothing to say
Burning lips press to mine
Tell me what just happened

I'm trembling
So frightened

Sonya, you're back
And with the tender resolve that often comes at the moment of awakening
I embraced my friend
But noticing Sonya's look of embarrassment
My face expressed confusion 
And suspicion

Sonya, you've read the letter?
Oh Sonya, I'm glad,
I can't hide it any longer!
Now you know, we love one another!
Oh Sonya, he writes, he writes
He writes, he writes, he writes



Oh Sonya, if you only knew how happy I am!
You don't know what love is

I do not grasp the question

Oh, you don't understand anything!
Don't talk nonsense, just listen

Three days?
It seems to me I've loved him a hundred years
It seems to me that I've never loved anyone before
Sonya, wait a bit, sit here

I had heard that it happens like this
And you must have heard it too
But it's only now
That I feel such love
It's not the same as before
He's my master and I am his slave
What can I do?
Sonya, what can I do?
I'm so happy
And so frightened
Why can't you understand?
I love him!
What do you mean?
For God's sake, if you tell, you are my enemy!
You want me to be miserable 
You want to tear us apart
For God's sake, Sonya, don't tell anyone, don't torture me
I have confided in you

I don't know what the reasons are
But there must be reasons!
Sonya, one can't doubt him!
One can't, one can't! Don't you understand?

Does he love me?
Why, you've read his letter, you've seen him
I can't live without him

Andrey said I was free to refuse him
Perhaps I have
Perhaps all is over between me and Bolkonsky 
Would you think so badly of me?
Then I'll go to my ruin, yes I will, as soon as possible!
But it's not your business!
It won't be you, it'll be me, who'll suffer
Leave me alone, yes leave me alone!
I hate you Sonya!
I hate you Sonya!
I hate you, I hate you!
You're my enemy forever!

And without a moment's reflection 
I wrote the answer to Princess Mary
I'd been unable to write all morning

All our misunderstandings are at an end
Forget everything and forgive me
But I can't be Andrey's wife



Don' touch me!
Let me be! What is it to me? I shall die!

I have no betrothed, I have refused him!

Don't touch me!

He is better than any of you I say
He is better than any of you I say
Why did you interfere! Oh God, what is it all?!
What is it?
Who are you to tell me anything?
Sonya, why?
Go away!
Everyone, go away!

Marya Dmitryevna tried to speak again but Natasha cried out 
Go away! Go away! You all hate and despise me!
And she threw herself down on the sofa
But Natasha was not asleep
Her face was pale
Her eyes wide open
All that night she did not sleep or weep
She sat at the window
Waiting for him

What? What?
I don't believe that he is married
I don't believe you
And I stare like a hunted wounded animal 
He can't be married!



Peter Kirilovich 

Prince Bolkonsky was your friend -
He is your friend
He once told me that I should turn to you

He is here now
Tell him to ? tell him to forgive me

No, I know that all is over
I know that it never can be
But still I'm tormented by the wrongs I've done him
Tell him that I beg him to forgive, forgive
Forgive me for everything

Don't call him bad
But I don't know, I don't know at all

Don't speak to me like that
I am not worth it!

Before me? No, all is over for me!

And for the first time in many days
I weep tears of gratitude
Tears of tenderness
Tears of thanks
And glancing at Pierre
O Pierre
I leave the room smiling
