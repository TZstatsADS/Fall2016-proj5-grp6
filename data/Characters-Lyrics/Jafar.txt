You're the one that I need
You're nimble, stealthy, skilled.
Do you want to continue abusing those skills?
Stealing bits of bread and worthless bobbles?
Or do you want to make a name for yourself
And do something that would make any mother proud?
You have the profile of a prince
With a physique that matches
Beneath the dirt and patches
You are a diamond in the rough
I say we work together since
You're braver then which you are
We're just as shocked as you are
That you're a diamond in the rough
Under the filth and the fleas there are gifts that you've been neglecting
And truth be told you are not quite the guy that we were expecting
And though you might need finesse, and perhaps some... disinfecting
You'll be the one who succeeds when the lamp of their needs collecting
Take one step and die you brainless miscreant! 
Apologies
What I meant to say is
You just don't know how swell you are 
So far the only hitch is 
You're an embarrassment of riches 
You are the diamond in the rough
Look here's the diamond in the
There is nobody else!
Oh- Then, of course there's Princess Jasmine
It's clear she took a shying to you
But, let me be frank,
With no cash in the bank,
You'll never win her heart
It just tears me apart
To see her slip right through your fingers
That a boy!
Go through you!
Might be a bum 
But you're one
Of noble spirit
So please no missteps or blunders
We don't have time for self-discovery!
Fetch me the lamp. Now!
Luck!
Goodbye you diamond in the
At last!
