Can it be? Can it be Christine?
Bravo!
Long ago, it seems so long ago
How young and innocent we were...
She may not remember me,
but I remember her...
Little Lotte let her mind wander
Little Lotte thought: Am I fonder of dolls
or of goblins or shoes?
As we read to each other dark stories of the North
You sang like an angel tonight

Oh, no doubt of it - And now we'll go to supper!

Well, I shan't keep you up late!

You must change. I'll order my carriage.
Two minutes - Little Lotte.

Whose is that voice?
Who is that in there?

Christine, Christine


Who is that voice?
Who's in there?

Christine.
Christine!
And what is it that I'm meant to have sent?
"Your days at the Opera Populaire are numbered.
Christine Daae will be singing on your behalf tonight.
Be prepared for a great misfortune should you attempt to take her place."
What you heard was a dream and nothing more...
No more talk of darkness,
Forget these wide-eyed fears
I'm here, nothing can harm you
my words will warm and calm you
Let me be your freedom,
let daylight dry your tears.
I'm here with you, beside you,
to guard you and to guide you...
RAOUL
Let me be your shelter
let me be your light
You're safe, No one will find you
your fears are far behind you...



Then say you'll share with me
one love, one lifetime
let me lead you from your solitude
Say you need me with you here, beside you...
anywhere you go, let me go too
Christine, that's all I ask of you...
You know I do...
. . . to the arms
Of her angel . . .
Angel or demon . . .
Still he calls her . . .
Luring her back, from the grave . . .
Angel or dark seducer . . .?
Who are you, strange
Angel . . .?

RAOUL 
Christine! Christine listen to me!
Whatever you may believe, this man . . .
this thing . . . is not your father!

Let her go! For God's sake, let her go! Christine !
