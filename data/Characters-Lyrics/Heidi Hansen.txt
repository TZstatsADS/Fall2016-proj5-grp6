Another stellar conversation for the scrapbook
Another stumble as I'm reaching for the right thing to say
It's a mystery at best
And with every second - second guessed
The answers feel lightyears away

See it used to be you'd come to me and solve all the problems
I could scare off any monster
Find Waldo every time
It was Super Mom to the rescue
You thought I knew it all

But I somehow went from bounding over buildings
To searching in the dark
As you became this total question mark
So...

So, does anybody have a map?
Anybody maybe happen to know how the hell to do this?
I don't know if you can tell
But this is me just pretending to know

So where's the map?
I need a clue
'Cause the scary truth is
I'm flying blind
I'm making this up as I go


So you found a place where the grass is greener
And you jumped the fence to the other side
Is it good?
Are they giving you a world I could never provide?

Well I hope you're proud of your big decision
Yeah, I hope it's all that you want and more
Now you're free from the agonizing life you were living before

Say what you need to say
So that you get to walk away
It would kill you to have to stay trapped
When you've got something new
Well I'm sorry you had it rough
I'm sorry I'm not enough
Thank God they rescued you

So you got what you always wanted
So you got your dream come true
Good for you
Good for you, you , you
Got a taste of a life so perfect
So you did what you had to do
Good for you
Good for you
Wait what?
Why are you so obsessed with this?
You didn't even know him
I'll shut my mouth and I'll let you go
Is that good for you?
Would that be good for you you you?
It was a February day
When your dad before going away
A U-Haul truck in the driveway
The day was suddenly real

I told you not to come outside
But you saw that truck
And you smiled so wide
A real live truck in your driveway
We let you sit behind the wheel
Good-bye, good-bye
Now it's just me and my little guy
And the house felt so big, and I felt so small
The house felt so big, and I felt so small

That night I tucked you into bed
I will never forget how you sat up and said
"Is there another truck coming to our driveway
A truck that will take mommy away?"
And the house felt so big, and I felt so small
The house felt so big, and I knew
There would be moments like this
And I knew
There would be space I couldn't fill
And I knew
I'd come up short a million different ways
And I did
And I do
And I will

But like that February day
I will take your hand, squeeze it tightly and say
There's not another truck in the driveway

Your mom isn't going anywhere
Your mom is staying right here
Your mom isn't going anywhere
Your mom is staying right here
No matter what
I'll be here

When it feels so big
'til it all feels so small
When it feels so big
'til it all feels so small
'til it all feels so small
