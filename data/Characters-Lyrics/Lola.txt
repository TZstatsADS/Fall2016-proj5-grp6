Leave expectations at the door
Just let your eyes explore
My cinematic flair
From my boot to derri√®re

I've got a lacy silken feel
With arms as hard as steel
I am freedom, I'm constriction
A potpourri of contradiction

Leave that hum-drum place of glum behind
Once you walk inside these doors you're mine
Now let me blow your mind.

And like shazam
And bam
Here I am
Yes, ma'am
I'm Lola

And like Je suis
Ooh-wee
That's me
Ebony
I am Lola

(Step in) Step in to a dream
(Where glam) Glamour is extreme
(Welcome) Welcome to my fantasy
We give good epiphany
So come and take my hand
Welcome to the land of Lola

Spoken:
No need to be embarrassed. I like being looked 

at. And you like to look. I know a way to make 

us both happy.

Lola, Lola, Lola

Got Ginger Rogers' savoir faire
With the moves of Fred Astaire
I'm black Jesus, I'm black Mary
But this Mary's legs are hairy

I'm your coco butter bitch
Not just cookie cutter kitsch
I provide the unexpected
with a prize that's undetected

Let Lola lift you to your highest highs
Let's explore your flight of fancy tonight
I'm / She's gonna treat you right

And like shazam
And bam
Here I am
Yes, ma'am
I'm Lola

And like Je suis
Ooh-wee
That's me
Ebony
I am Lola

We give good epiphany

(Step in) Step in to a dream

The sex is in the heel
even if you break it
The sex is in the feel
Honey, you can't fake it
Jack it up 'cause I'm no flat tire
Mack it up six inches higher
The sex is in the heel
so just embrace it

From London to Milan
stilettos are an "ism"
in red and neon light
Gimme Jimmy Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo shoes
in New York, Paris, encore
Live it like an "ism"
Seduction at the thigh
The heel is the transmission

The sex is in the heel
fierce as you can make it
The sex is the appeal
Kinky boys can shake it
Funk it up till it's ostentatious
Dress it up, it feels contagious
The sex is in the heel
so just embrace it

From London to Milan
stilettos are an "ism"
in red and neon light
Gimme Jimmy Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo shoes
in New York, Paris, encore
Live it like an "ism"
Seduction at the thigh
The heel is the transmission

Red's the color of panic, passion
Burgundy's the color of allergic reaction
It's not Shlomo, it's Manolo
La dolce vita at the go-go
Kinky boots with lots of swagger
It's high-heeled heaven with a dagger

From London to Milan
stilettos are an "ism"
in red and neon light
Gimme Jimmy Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo shoes
in New York, Paris, encore
Live it like an "ism"
Seduction at the thigh
The heel is the transmission

We're getting ready for the new
CHARLIE:
Witness the future of Price & Son
Oh, papa's got a brand new shoe
A life of broken heels
Got you down
Get up!
Yeah, yeah
I see flash bulb lights
And fashion heights
He want to hear you say yeah, yeah
Say yeah
Everybody
He wants to hear you say yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Say yeah



Stand back, let me tell you something
What a woman wants to see
Stand back, Mr. I-Know-Everything
But it's what you blindly see

What a woman wants
Masculinity	
(What a Man)
Sensitivity
(What a Man)
In a fantasy
(What a Man)
What a woman wants
(What a Man)
A muffin to clutch
(What a Man)

Just a tender touch
You don't get out too much
To know the smoothness of her skin with a gentle caress 
Feel the feathery quality of her dress 
What separates a man like you from a man like me 

I'm a reflection, 
Her protection 
I'm her curious mystery 



In this corner lean and brown
Weighing in in a gold lama gown. 
Yeah yeah In this corner, here tonight 
In the cradle of a bright white light 
Hit him in his big mouth Hit him in his insecurities. 
Yeah Hit him off his high horse 
Hit him so everyone can see. Yeah

In this corner, heavy weight
Breathing heavy like a butter milk cake
Can a real man ever confess
He was beaten by a guy in a dress
Oh hit him in the lipstick
Hit him in the wind beneath his feet. 
Yeah Hit him off his high heel 
Hit him in the cheek 
And send him back to London town 
Sequin freak!

In this corner wow the crowd
Take him down and make us ladies proud
In this corner dominate
Set it off so we can set them straight

Hit him in his big mouth
Hit him in his insecurities. Yeah
Hit him off his high horse
Hit him so everyone can see. Oh yeah

So you got a good shot but don't get cocky 
I am pretty as Ali and tough as Rocky 
If you're lucky I might let you off easy 
Don you know I get excited when you tease me 
What's the matter?
Don you look a little pale I feel like the hammer 
I feel like the nail 
C'mon Don knock him black and blue 
Here come an uppercut, a left hook and a pirouette too 

Round two!
Hit him in his big mouth
Hit him in his insecurities. Yeah
Hit him off his high horse
Hit him so everyone can
Everyone can
Everyone can
Un deux trois
Hit him off his high horse
C'mon really let that bigot fly. 
Yeah
Hit him with his brute force
Now he can hold his head up high
High, high
Now he can hold his head up high

What woman wants
(What a Man, what a man, What a Man, what a man)
What woman
(What a Man)
What a woman
(What a Man, what a man)
What a woman wants
(What a man)

C'mon we all know what a bird really wants is a rock solid 
Mmhmm 

COMMITMENT 
Look at me, devilishly debonair 
Look at you divinely dull, drab and dumpy 
A woman wants a man to give as much as she can take 
Just like me A bit of a slob ??????????
Oh piss off

Oh I have a challenge for you. 



You don't want to see me anymore.
You can't listen to me laugh out loud.
You don't wanna see me dance.
You can't even take the chance
that it might reflect on you.
You missed out on the best part of me.
The part that made me who I am today.
O, but the best part of me is standing in front of you
and loves you anyway.
Hold me In your heart till you understand.
Hold me In your heart just the way that I am.
With all your faults, I love you.
Don't give up on me.
I wont give up on you.
Well you took my hand, taught me how to be strong
That's where I picked up when we went all wrong.
I know that I hurt you, and you hurt me too,
but you mean more to me, I must mean more to you.
Hold me In your heart till you understand.
Hold me In your heart just the way that I am
With all your faults I love you
I need you to love me that way too.




Write down what you think 
I need to do to be a real man and 
I'll do the same for you. 
Whatever you tell me to do 
I will have to do. 
But you will have to do the same for me.
Deal?

I ain't wearing no poufy dress.
Chickening out already?

(What a man, what a man, what a man)
What a woman wants
What a woman wants
What a woman wants
What a woman
What a woman
What a woman wants is me
What a woman wants
What a woman wants
(What a man)
