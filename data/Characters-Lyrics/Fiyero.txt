The trouble with school is
They always try to teach the wrong lesson
Believe me, I've been kicked out
Of enough of them to know
They want you to become less callow
Less shallow
But I say: why invite stress in?
Stop studying strife
And learn to live "the unexamined life":

Dancing through life
Skimming the surface
Gliding where turf is smooth
Life's more painless
For the brainless
Why think too hard?
When it's so soothing
Dancing through life
No need to tough it
When you can sluff it off as I do
Nothing matters
But knowing nothing matters
It's just life
So keep dancing through

Dancing through life
Swaying and sweeping
And always keeping cool
Life is fraught-less
When you're thoughtless
Those who don't try
Never look foolish
Dancing through life
Mindless and careless
Make sure you're where less
Trouble is rife
Woes are fleeting
Blows are glancing
When you're dancing
Through life:
(spoken) So - what's the most swankified place in town?
Sounds perfect.
(sung) Let's go down to the Ozdust Ballroom
We'll meet there later tonight
We can dance till it's light
Find the prettiest girl:
Give 'er a whirl:
Right on down to the Ozdust Ballroom
Come on - follow me
You'll be happy to be there:

Maybe I'm brainless
Maybe I'm wise
But you've got me seeing 
Though different eyes
Somehow I've fallen 
Under your spell
And somehow I'm feeling
It's up that I fell
Say there's no future
For us as a pair
