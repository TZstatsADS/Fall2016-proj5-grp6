I'm going to bed
Cynthia
I'm exhausted
Not tonight. Please. I'll leave the light on for you.
I gave you the world, you threw it away,
leaving these broken pieces behind you
Everything wasted, nothing to say
So I can sing no requiem
I will sing no requiem
No one will tell you how to really do it right
That's a secret method only known to very few
So if you need some pointers, just in case you might
Well, then, maybe I could show you what to do
Shaving cream
You rub that in for about five minutes
And then you tie it all up in rubber bands
Put it under your mattress, and sleep on it
And then the next day, you repeat
And you gotta do it for at least a week, every day, consistently
And though this method isn't easy
Every second that you spend is gonna pay off
It'll pay off in the end
It just takes a little patience
Takes a little time
A little perseverance
A little uphill climb
You might not think it's worth it
You might begin to doubt
But you can't take any shortcuts
You gotta stick it out
And it's the hard way, but it's the right way
The right way to break in a glove
But nowadays, with your generation
I hate to say it, but it's all about instant gratification
Who wants to read a book when you can read the Facebook instead?
Speaking of instant gratification, I figured we might need it
I mean, only if you want to
Some people say just use a microwave
Or try that "run it through hot water" technique
Well, they can gloat about the time they saved
'til they gotta buy another glove next week
It just takes a little patience
Takes a little time
A little perseverance
And a little uphill climb
And it's the hard way, but it's the right way
The right way...
There's a right way in everything you do
Keep that grit
Follow through
Even when everyone around you thinks you're crazy
Even when everyone around you lets things go
And if you're prepping for some test
Or if you're miles from some goal
Or you're just trying to do what's best
For a kid who's lost control
You do the hard thing
And that's the right thing
Yeah, that's the right way
