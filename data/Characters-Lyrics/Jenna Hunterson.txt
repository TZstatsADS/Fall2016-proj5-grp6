It's a bad idea, me and you
It's a bad idea, me and you
I've never known anything so true
It's a terrible idea, me and you

You have a wife
You have a husband
You're my doctor
You've got a baby coming
It's a bad idea, me and you
Let's just keep kissing til we come to

Heart, stop racing
Let's face it, making mistakes like this will make worse what was already pretty bad
Mind, stop running
It's time we just let this thing go
It was a pretty good bad idea, wasn't it though?

It's a bad idea, me and you
It's a bad idea, me and you
Hold me close while I think this through
(Um, um, yeah)
Yeah, it's a very poor idea, me and you

I got a wife
I got a husband
I'm your doctor
My dumb baby's coming
It's a bad idea, me and you
Maybe one more kiss will make us come to

Heart, stop racing
Let's face it, making mistakes like this
will make worse what was already pretty bad
Mind, stop running
It's time we just let this thing go
It was a pretty good bad idea, wasn't it though?

It's not right for me
It's the only thing I've ever done
What if I never see myself ever be anything more
than what I've already become?
I need a bad idea
I need a bad idea
I need a bad idea
I need a bad idea
Just one

Heart, keep racing
Let's make mistakes
Let us say "so what?" and make worse what was already pretty bad
This secret is safe
No reason to throw it away when there's love to be had
Hold me tight as I tell myself that you might make sense
And make good what has been just so bad
Let's see this through
It's a pretty good bad idea
Me and you


I could find the whole meaning of life in those sad eyes
They've seen things that you never quite say, but I hear
Come out of hiding, I'm right here beside you
And I'll stay there as long as you let me

Because you matter to me
Simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody
You matter to me
I promise you do, you, you matter too
I promise you do, you see?
You matter to me


Sugar, sugar
Sugar, butter
Sugar, butter
Sugar, butter, flour
Sugar, butter, flour
Sugar, butter, flour
Sugar, butter, flour

My hands pluck the things I know that I'll need
I take the sugar and butter from the pantry
I add the flour to begin what I am hoping to start
And then it's down with the recipe
And bake from the heart

Sugar
And butter
And flour
And mother

What's inside?
Everyone wants to know what's inside
And I always tell them but I
Feel more than words can say
You wanna know what's inside?
Simple question, so then what's the answer?
My whole life is in here
In this kitchen baking
What a mess I'm making



i don't know what i wish i had
But there's no time now for thinking things like that
We've got too much to do
(sung) how's i ever get myself in this mess?
One drunk night in that stupid red dress
Funny how one night can ruin your whole life

Make it work
Make it easy
Make it clever, craft it into pieces
Make it sweet
Crimp the edges
Or make it sour and serve with lemon wedges
Even doubt
Can be delicious
And it washes off of all the dirty dishes
When it's done
I can smile
It's on someone else's plate for a while

I'll place it on display
And then I'll slice and serve my worries away

I can fix this
I can twist it into sugar, butter covered pieces
Never mind what's underneath it
I have done it before
I'll bake me a door to help me get through
I learned that from you
Mama, it's amazing what baking can do

Make it up
And surprise them
Tell them all my secrets but disguise them
So they dance on the tongue
Of the very people that they're secrets from


Hmm. Oh well no one ever really notices me that way so...


'Till the sun don't shine
You will still be mine

Sugar
Sugar, butter, flour
Sometimes I still see her
My mother the dreamer
She'd say, "Nothing's impossible child"

A dream needs believing
To taste like the real thing
Like some stranger you recognize
So pure, so pure, so electric
So sure, so sure, so connected
To those little believers inside
May we all be so lucky

But dreams are elusive
The kind we've gotten used to
Is nothing I can feel
Nothing I can hold
Nothing I can have
Nothing that I know
Dreams come and they go

But hold them and keep them
And know that you need them
When your breaking point's all that you have
A dream is a soft place to land
May we all be so lucky
Sugar, butter, flour


Make it soon
Make it better
Though, better never lasts forever
I'll make it small so it fits . . . .

Even this . . .
Even now . . .
Even as the walls come tumbling down
Even as I can't stop remembering how
Every door we ever made, we never once walked out
Something I never got the chance to ask her about

So with flour on my hands
I'll show them all how
Goddamn happy I am
Sugar, butter, flour
Don't let me down!
Let's see the next amazing thing baking does now




It's addictive the minute you let yourself think
The things that I say just might matter to someone
All of this time I've been keeping my mind on the running away
And for the first time I think I'd consider the stay

Because you matter to me
Simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody
You matter to me
I promise you do, you, you matter too
I promise you do, you see?
You matter to me

Today's a day like any other
But i am changed, i am a mother
Oh in an instant
And who i was has disappeared
It doesn't matter, now you're here
So innocent
I was lost for you to find
And now i'm yours and you are mine

Two tiny hands, a pair of eyes
An unsung melody is mine for safekeeping
And i will guard it with my life
I'd hang the moon for it to shine on her sleeping
Starting here and starting now
I can feel the heart of how
I didn't know, but now i see
Sometimes what is, is meant to be
You saved me
My blurry lines, my messy life
Come into focus and in time, maybe
I can heal and i can breathe
'Cause i can feel myself believe
And all my mistakes
They make sense when i turn them around
Everything changes
What i thought was so permanent fades
In the blink of an eye, there's a new life in front of my face
And i know in due time, every right thing will find its right place
And i swear i'll remember to say we were both born today! Cause everything changed!
Everything changes
