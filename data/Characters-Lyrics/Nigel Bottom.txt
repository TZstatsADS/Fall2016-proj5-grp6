No!
Why?
But he’s brilliant
What majesty flows from his pen
His poetry soars like a sweet violin
God’s own inspiration like lightning doth strike him
And he captures my soul!
Really? Thanks…
Well no I don’t, I try to emulate Shakespeare!
Why is it a problem to admit that I’m a fan?
Well that’s not gonna happen, 
because everyone I know says that he’s the greatest writer that England’s ever known!
Don’t hate!

Oh it’s okay,
I just never knew that poetry could affect someone the way it affects me
It’s the end all, the be all. Oh, you ought a see all the books that I have on my shelf

No, I know what you mean
When I’m deep in the throes of impassionate prose,
I could scream
Yeah
Who doesn’t love alliteration?
It’s sweet elation
Me too!

If love is a sickness
Then find me no cure
For tis only love
That I know to be pure

Your father

If love is love purely
Then let me opine
That all love is surely divine

Nick, just read it
I really think I'm on to something here

There is no omelette!
Ahh!
Are you hearing yourself? (What?)
Nick, are you hearing yourself? (Yes)
I can't believe we're having a conversation about a story that has to be all about eggs (So?)
Eggs! (Yes)
What is it with you and these eggs?

I think that you're out of your mind if you think that pursuing that is a good thing

Okay, well I don't

Doesn't matter, he won't listen

You asked me to write something, well here it is
Sure as the day follows into night
Sure as the sky turns to blue
This much I know
This much is true
Above all else, whatever you do

I'm ignoring the breakfast theme because it's ridiculous

That's not just a line
It's what I believe

Well I do

Ah, this is hopeless
I don't know how to get through to you
Nick, the fact that you think Omelette is good,
It worries me
Guys, can you help me out here

How can you possibly know that?

This descent into madness, that's you
Nick, I mean it
Whatever happened to the guy who inspired me to become a writer?
No
