Is everybody here?
Is everybody ready?
Hit it!
I don't care about expensive things
Cashmere coats, diamond rings
Don't mean a thing
All I care about is love Girls:
That's what I'm here for That's what he's here for
I don't care for wearing silk cravats
Ruby studs, satin spats
Don't mean a thing
All I care about is love Girls:
All he cares about is love
Give me two
Eyes of blue
Softly saying, "I need you"
Let me see her standin' there
And honest, mister, I'm a millionaire
I don't care for any fine attire
Vanderbilt might admire
No, no, not me
All I care about is love Girls:
All he cares about is love
Maybe you think I'm talking about my physical love. Well, 
I'm not. Not just physical love. There's other kinds of 
love. Like love of justice. Love of legal procedure. Love 
of lending a hand to someone who really needs you. Love of 
your fellow man. That's the kind of love I'm talkin' about.
And physical love ain't so bad either.
It may sound odd
But all I care about is love Girls:
That's what I'm here for That's for he's here for
Honest to God
All I care about is love Girls:
All he cares about is love
Show me long raven hair
Flowin' down, about to three
Let me see
Her runnin' free
Keep your money, that's enough for me
I don't care for drivin' Packard cars
Or smoking long buck cigars
No, no, not me
All I care about is
Doin' the guy in
Who's pickin', on you
Twistin' the wrist
That's turnin' the screw
All I care about is love Girls:
All he cares about is love
Now look, in a few minutes there'll be a whole bunch of 
photographers and reporters and that sob sister from the 
Evening Star is coming.
(a coloratura trill is heard off stage)
I don't figure we'll have any trouble with her. 
She'll swallow hook, line and sinker.
Her name is Mary Sunshine.
But she was granted one more start
She knew that she was doin' wrong
He had strength and she had none
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes they both
Oh yes, they both
Oh yes, they both reached for 
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun
Oh yes, they both reached for the gun
For the gun.
Understandable, understandable
Yes, it's perfectly understandable
Comprehensible, comprehensible
Not a bit reprehensible
It's so defensible!
Billy and Mary Sunshine:
Yes, it's perfectly understandable
Comprehensible, comprehensible
Not a bit reprehensible
It's so defensible!
Let me Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes they both
Hear it! Oh yes, they both
Oh yes, they both reached for 
The gun, the gun, the gun, 
The gun

For the gun
A little louder! For the gun.
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes they both
Oh yes, they both
Oh yes, they both reached 
For the gun, the gun,

Oh yes, they both reached 
For the gun
For the gun.

The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun

The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun,

Both reached for the...gun
Thank you. Just a moment. You ready?
Roxie. You got nothing to worry about. It's all a circus, kid. 
A three ring circus. These trial - the whole world - all show 
business. But kid, you're working with a star, the biggest!
Give 'em the old razzle dazzle
Razzle dazzle 'em
Give 'em act with lots of flash in it
And the reaction will be passionate
Give 'em the old hocus pocus
Bread and feather 'em
How can they see with sequins in their eyes?
What if your hinges all are rusting?
What if, in fact, you're just disgusting ?
Razzle dazzle 'em
And they'll never catch wise!
Eh Eh Eh Eh 
Ah! Ah! Ah!
Give 'em the old razzle dazzle
Razzle dazzle 'em
Give 'em a show that's so splendiferous
Row after row will grow vociferous
Give 'em the old flim flam flummox
Fool and fracture 'em
How can they hear the truth above the roar?
Throw 'em a fake and a finagle 
They'll never know you're just a bagel,
Razzle dazzle 'em
And they'll beg you for more!
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
Give 'em the old razzle dazzle
Razzle dazzle 'em
Back since the days of old Methuselah
Everyone loves the big bambooz-a-ler

Give 'em the old three ring circus
Stun and stagger 'em
When you're in trouble, go into your dance
Though you are stiffer than a girder
They let ya get away with a murder
Razzle dazzle 'em
And you've got a romance

Give 'em the old 
Razzle dazzle
Razzle dazzle 'em
Give 'em an act that's unassailable
They'll wait a year 'til your available!
Give 'em the old
Double whammy

Daze and dizzy 'em
Show 'em the first rate sorcerer you are
Long as you keep 'em way off balance
How can they spot you got no talents?
Razzle dazzle 'em
Razzle dazzle 'em
And they'll make you a star!
