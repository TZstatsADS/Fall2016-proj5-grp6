My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you,
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you:
So close, so close and yet so far away

Carried your books from school,
Playing make-believe you're married to me:
You were fifth grade, I was sixth
When we came to be
Walking home every day over Barnegat Bridge and Bay,
Till we grew into the me and you
Who went our separate ways

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you,
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you:
So close, so close and yet so far

Headed for city lights,
Climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame,
I worked my fingers to the bone,
Made myself a name.
Funny, I seem to find that, no matter how the years unwind,
Still I reminisce about the girI miss
And the love I left behind...

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you,
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you:
So close, so close and yet so far

All my life I will remember how warm and tender
We were way back then
Though I'm feeling sad regrets I know I won't ever forget
You, my childhood friend

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you,
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you:
So close, so close and yet so far



Marianne, Marianne, Marianne, Marianne 

Whoa-ho-ho here I am on my knees again 
I'll do anything just to make it right 
Say you'll understand, oh I know you can 
C'mon Marianne 


No matter what people say, it didn't happen that way 
She was a passing fling and not a permanent thing 
Say you'll understand, oh I know you can 

C'mon Marianne (baby) 
C'mon Marianne (baby) 
C'mon Marianne (baby) 
Say you can understand 
My Marianne, Marianne, Marianne, Marianne 

Well now your big brown eyes are all full of tears 
From the bitterness of my cheatin' years 
So I hang my head, wish that I was dead 
C'mon Marianne (baby) 
C'mon Marianne (baby) 
C'mon Marianne (baby) 
Say you can understand 
My Marianne (baby) 
C'mon Marianne (baby) 
C'mon Marianne (baby) 

Marianne, Marianne, Marianne, Marianne 
You're just too good to be true 
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
So if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

I love you baby and if it's quite all right
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights
I love you baby, trust in me when I say
Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down I pray

Oh pretty baby, now that I've found you stay
And let me love you baby, let me love you

You're just too good to be true 
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you 



orking my way back to you babe
With a burning love inside
Yeah, I'm workin my way back to you, babe
And the happiness that died
I let it get away, paying every day

When you were so in love with me
I played around like I was free
Thought I could have my cake and eat it too
Oh how I cried over losing you

For every day I made you cry
I'm paying girl til the day that I die
I'll keep working my way back to you babe
With a burning love inside
I'm working my way back to you babe
With a happiness that died
I let it get away, payin every day

I used to love to make you cry
It made me feel like a man inside
But if I'd been a man in reality
You'd still be here babe lovin me

Now the nights are long and lonely
And I'm not too strong babe I just miss you so
And you're too proud, won't give in
But when I think about all I could win

I keep working my way back to you babe
With a burning love inside
I'm working my way back to you babe
With a happiness that died
I let it get away, payin every day

yeah yeah yeah

Working my way back to you babe
With a burning love inside
I'm working my way back to you babe
WIth a happiness that died oh how I'm cryin
Working my way back to you babe
With a burning love inside
You're home again,
Glad you kept the key
Been waitin' here
seems a million years to me,
but, hush now,
I know you're all cried out
It's alright
inside I've had no doubt about
your love for me
I can see behind the tears
I certain of the way we feel 
and given time the hurt will heal

You're home again, 
so won't you close the door
stay here with me, 
and we'll forget what's gone before
just hold on tight
our love is gonna make it if I
put shadows way beyond recall
The ghost has almost gone

Fallen Angel
I'll forgive you anything 
you can't help the things you do
now, something's gotten hold of you
Fallen Angel
Got a demon in your soul
And later when the fever's gone
I'll be here where you belong.
