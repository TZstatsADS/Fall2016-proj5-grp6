Stop being pathetic, Jenny.
Stop pretending, Jenny.
That you are going to march in there and give them a piece of your mind!

Leave it alone Jenny!
The more that you try.
The more you will look like a fool!

This is not your problem.
You've not got the spine.
You are a teacher just go back to school!

But this little girl...
This miracle...
She seems not to know
That she's special at all.

And what sort of teacher would I be
If I let this little girl fall through the cracks I can see,
This little girl needs somebody strong
To fight by her side.

Instead she's found me.
Pathetic little me!
And another door closes.
And Jenny's outside.


This roof keeps me dry when the rain falls.
This door helps to keep the cold at bay.
On this floor I can stand on my own two feet.

On this chair I can write my lessons.
On this pillow I can dream my nights away.
And this table, as you can see, well, it's perfect for tea.

It isn't much but it is enough for me.
It isn't much but it is enough...

On these walls I hang wonderful pictures.
Through this window I can watch the seasons change.
By this lamp I can read, and I, I am set free!

And when it's cold outside I feel no fear!
Even in the winter storms, I am warmed by a small but stubborn fire.
And there is no-where I would rather be.

It isn't much but it is enough for me.
It isn't much but it is enough for me.

For this is my house!
This is my house!
It isn't much but it is enough for me.

This is my house!
This is my house!
It isn't much but it is enough.


Knock on the door, Jenny.
Just knock on the door.
Don't be pathetic!

Knock on the door, Jenny.
There's nothing to fear.
You're being pathetic!
It's just a door, you've seen one before.
Just knock on the door!

Look at you trying to hide, silly.
Standing outside the Principal's Office.
Like a little girl!
It's just ... pathetic!
Ohhh!

Look at you hesitating, hands shaking!
You should be embarrassed!
You're not a little girl.
It's just pathetic.

Knock on the door, Jenny.
What are you waiting for?
Just knock on the door!



Perhaps I will wait.
She's probably having a meeting or something.
And won't want to be interrupted.
If anything, caution in these situations is sensible.
One should avoid confrontation when possible.
I'll come back later then!


But this little girl
This miracle

Knock on the door, Jenny.
Just knock on the door.
Don't be pathetic!
