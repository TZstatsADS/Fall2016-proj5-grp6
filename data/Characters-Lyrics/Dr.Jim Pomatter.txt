You know what's kind of funny? 
Just seeing you sitting here all by yourself in your uniform.

Dr. Pomatter (singing): 
You remind me of a girl i once knew.
God, by now she's well in middle age.
Probably 41. 42.

Jenna (spoken):
Huh. Thank you?

Dr. Pomatter (spoken): 
What? Oh my god! No! No! No! No!

Dr. Pomatter: 
She was a waitress at a shop i used to frequent quite a lot.
Nice teeth and small hands
And snuck me goodies i couldn't afford then.
But she was sweet too.
Reminds me of you

Jenna (spoken): 
Hmm. Oh well no one ever really notices me that way so...

Dr. Pomatter (spoken): 
Somebody did right?

Jenna (spoken): 
Hmm?

Dr. Pomatter (spoken): 
Yah, because you have th... The baby.

Dr. Pomatter: 
She'd bake the pies fresh every day


Like you i guess,


But i must say
If pies were books yours would be shakespeare's letters.
You remind me of her,
But better

It only takes a taste when it's something special.
It only takes a taste when you know it's good.
Sometimes one bite is more than enough
To know you want more of the thing you just got a taste of.

that reminds me of a thing we would say.
Me and my mamma in the kitchen when we'd bake.
She's say "jenna, you can tell the whole story with a taste."


Yah.

No, that's exactly what i mean.
I swear that as those flavors mixed and melted
I could hear the sirens sing.
It was truly something special.
One taste and i want the whole thing.

I must say it felt like i was carried away.
Intoxicated.
Made me escape the room i was in.
I can't help but wonder
How your hand must have felt making that masterful thing.

It only takes a taste
