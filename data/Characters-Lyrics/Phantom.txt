PHANTOM
Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me to glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there 
Inside your mind

CHRISTINE 
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

PHANTOM
It's me they hear...


BOTH
Your/My spirit and my/your voice in one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my/your mind

BACKGROUND
He's there, the phantom of the opera!

CHRISTINE
He`s there, the phantom of the opera

PHANTOM
Sing, my Angel of Music
Sing, my Angel
Sing for me
Sing, my Angel!
Sing for me!
Night time sharpens, 
Heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses 
Abandon their defenses

Slowly gently, night unfurls
Its splendour
Grasp it, sense it, 
Tremulous and tender

Turn your face away 
From the garish light of day, 
Turn your thoughts away 
From cold unfeeling light 
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and 
Surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life
You knew before 
Close your eyes, 
Let your spirit start to soar

And you'll live as you've 
Never lived before

Softly, deftly
Music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it 
Secretly possess you

Open up your mind 
Let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know 
You can not fight,
The darkness of 
The music of the night

Let your mind start a journey 
Through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world
You knew before
Let your soul take 
You where you long to be

Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling
Sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me
Savor each sensation
Let the dream begin
Let your darker side give in
To the power of 
The music that I write
The power of 
The music of the night 

You alone can make 
My song take flight 
Help me make the 
Music of the night




D*** you! 
You little prying Pandora!
You little demon
Is this what you wanted to see?
Curse you!
You little lying Delilah!
You little viper
Now you cannot ever be free! 

D*** you...
Curse you...

Stranger than you dreamt it
Can you even dare to look
or bare to think of me:
this loathsome gargoyle, who burns in h***,
but secretly yearns for heaven,
secretly... secretly...
Christine...

Fear can turn to love - you'll learn to see
to find the man behind the monster:
this repulsive carcass, who seems a beast
but secretly dreams of beauty, 
secretly... secretly... 
Oh, Christine...

Come, we must return
Those two fools Who run my
theater will be missing you.



.I shall give you one last chance
Christine Daae has returned to you
And I am anxious her career should progress
In the new production of Il Muto
You will therefore cast Carlotta as the page boy
And put Miss Daae in the role of Countess
The role which Miss Daae plays calls for charm and appeal
The role of the page boy is silent which makes my casting in a word, ideal
I shall watch the performance from my normal seat in box 5 which will be kept empty for me
Should these commands be ignored a disaster beyond your imagination will occur
I remain, gentlemen, your obedient servant
O.G
So, it is to be war between us. If these demands are not met, a disaster beyond imagination will occur! 
I gave you my music . . .
made your song take wing . . .
and now, how you've
repaid me:
denied me
and betrayed me . . .
He was bound to love you
when he heard you sing . . .

Christine ...
Christine ...
You will curse the day you did not do!
All of the Phantom asked of you!
Far from my far-reaching gaze . 


Angel of Music!
You denied me/I denied you
Turning from true beauty . . .
Angel of Music!
Do not shun me/My protector . . .
Come to your strange
Angel . . .
I am your Angel of Music . . .
Come to me: Angel of Music . . .
I am your Angel of Music . . .
Come to me: Angel of Music . . .
Past the point
of no return -
no backward glances:
our games of make believe
are at an end . . .
Past all thought
of "if" or "when" -
no use resisting:
abandon thought,
and let the dream
descend . . .

What raging fire
shall flood the soul?
What rich desire
unlocks its door?
What sweet seduction
lies before
us . . .?

Past the point
of no return,
the final threshold -
what warm,
unspoken secrets
will we learn?
Beyond the point
of no return . . .

AMINTA (CHRISTINE)
You have brought me
to that moment
where words run dry,
to that moment
where speech
disappears
into silence,
silence . . .

I have come here,
hardly knowing
the reason why . . .
In my mind,
I've already
imagined our
bodies entwining
defenseless and silent -
and now I am
here with you:
no second thoughts,


I've decided,
decided . . .

Past the point
of no return -
no going back now:
our passion-play
has now, at last,
begun . . .
Past all thought
of right or wrong -
one final question:
how long should we
two wait, before
we're one . . .?

When will the blood
begin to race
the sleeping bud
burst into bloom?
When will the flames,
at last, consume
us . . .?

BOTH
Past the point
of no return
the final threshold -
the bridge
is crossed, so stand
and watch it burn . . .
We've passed the point
of no return . . .
