God, I hate Shakespeare
But when I sit and really contemplate Shakespeare
I guess I hate the fact that he is everything I ever dreamed that I could be
I mostly hate the way he makes me feel about me
Cause the truth is

It wouldn't be that bad to be Shakespeare
In fact, I'd give my left gnad to be Shakespeare
If I could only have one tiny little smidgen of his notoriety
It would relieve me of these pressures of responsibility

I've gotta make it happen
Gotta find that pot of gold
If there was just some way to know just what the future holds
What the future holds!

What the hell are musicals?
Through song?
Wait, so an actor is saying his lines and out of nowhere he just starts singing?

Well that is the
(Singing) Stupidest thing that I have ever heard
You're doing a play, got something to say
So you sing it?
It's absurd
Who on earth is going to sit there while an actor breaks into song
And what possible thought could the audience think
Other than "This is horribly wrong"
Seriously? Why not?

I don't know
I find it hard to believe that people would actually pay to see something like this

No talking at all

Um, really?

There's no talking

That sounds miserable

And people actually like this?

What the hell are you doing now?

Why?
Does it advance the plot? (No)
Advance character? (Not necessarily)
Then why do it?
Yes! I get it now!
We'll do a musical (No kidding)
A musical
What could be more amazing than a musical
With song and dance
And sweet romance
And with a musical we might have half a chance
If you ever got in trouble
I would be there on the double
Just to bail you out

If there's anything you lack
You know I've always got your back
Thats what its all about

Think of me as your sidekick
Helping you whenever I can
I'm more than just a woman, baby
When the pressure's coming baby
Let me be your right hand man

(But your not a man, I'm the man)
UGH, your not hearing me

If you're ever in a pickle
You can call for me and quick'll
Be how fast I run

(I'm not in a pickle)

You and me should be a team
For any dream or any scheme
That's how it should be done

Sure I could stay in the background
Just smiling every now and again
But just to be a pretty lady
That would be a pity baby
Let me be your right hand man

(You should listen to her, she's usually right)
(Eat your cabbage)
(Okay)

I am stronger than you think
Don't be thinking I ain't tough
I am where you oughta go
When the goings getting rough

So when things are going badly
(But they're not)
(They kinda are)
(No things are fine)
But if they weren't
(it's okay)
Love (what) UGHHH
(What?)
Quit trying to protect me
(Can we change the subject, please?)

Not until I know that

If you're ever in a fix
And its a fix you need to nix
Then I'm your go to guy
(You're not a guy)
Don't be so literal

And don't forget I'm not a shrinking violet
A solid rock am I
So don't be thinking I'll crumble
When the you know what hits the fan

There's no problem thats to big
When your married thats the gig
So don't be a sexist pig

Is it asking to much of you
It's only cuz I love you
Let me be your right
In fact I'll show you that I'm right

(What are you doing now?)
I'm going to get you boys some meat

Baby I'm your right
Don't put up a fight
I can be your right
Starting here tonight
Let me be your
RIght....Hand....Man

Let me be your right hand man

No more Mr. Anonymous
No more world that is Nick Bottom-less
My name will be synonymous with being on the top

I can see it now
I'm the cat's meow
It's a hit pow!
It's gonna be great, gonna be great

Everywhere I go
They will love me so
Hail my name
Oh, it's gonna be great, gonna be great

Thank you Jesus and Hail Mary!

Man, I'm gonna sizzle
Man, I'm gonna pop

This is heaven sent
Feeling confident
Money well spent
It's gonna be great, gonna be great

Throw a big parade
Praises will be made
Compliments paid
It's gonna be great, gonna be great

I really shouldn't say it
But yes I am!

Once I get going, never gonna stop

Oh man I have been waiting for this moment for so long
I'm gonna enjoy it when I knock you off your perch

Oh yes I will

Oh yes I will
Oh yes I will

In your dreams
I am the best
Well I have just written the thing that the critics are calling the greatest thing they've ever seen
The people are loving it
Can't get enough of it
Everyone, even including the Queen
She recently invited me to her castle where she knighted me
And privately she told me that you're not any good, not any good, not any good, not any good
And she told me that all of your plays make her vomit
And none of them's as good as my musical Omelette

Yes

Oh my, how the tide has turned
Let's review
What have we learned
See, you were here
But now we've swapped
So kiss this Bottom
I'm on the top
I see within this fluffy form
The scrambled nature of my soul
I'm cracking up as I begin
To see the bits of me within this

I am reading
And where's the omelette?

What do you mean there's no omelette?
There has to be an omelette
It's called Omelette!
Are you hearing yourself? (What?)
Nick, are you hearing yourself? (Yes)
I can't believe we're having a conversation about a story that has to be all about eggs (So?)
Eggs! (Yes)
What is it with you and these eggs?

You just have to trust me
I know what I'm doing

Well I do

What the hell are they talking about?

That's it?

Exactly!
But there's no Danish, there's no ham, there's no breakfast at all!
You're completely ignoring the theme

Oh, are you hearing yourself? (Nick!)
I said, are you hearing yourself? (Yes)
I can't believe you're trying to change direction
Because you decided that my ideas are wrong (Please)
I'm wrong
And this true to yourself thing is right?

Then you are a fool and really naive
If you think it's as simple as that

Okay well I don't

Want some truth?
Here's the truth
Omelette will be known as perhaps the single greatest play ever written

I just do
This will be talked about for generations to come
We need a hit
Not some audience-repelling death play about your descent into madness

He finally has a great idea
Now, we open in a week
Are you going to help me write Omelette or not?
No?

I can't
It doesn't feel right
And deep down, I don't think it feels right to you either

I'll tell you what we do
We serve up what they're hungry for
Omelette the musical

We're on our way to glory
We'll play for kings and queens
And there and then they'll see the end will justify the means

Surely we must see this through (Okay, if you say so)
Damned if I don't (Don't!)
Damned if I do (Do!)
Damn it, I don't have the luxury to
Hang all my hope on some simplistic trope
Like to thine own self (To thine own self)
Be true

Alas, poor yolk, I know thee well
There's something rotten
There's something rotten

My father newly dead and the funeral
Boiled eggs now coldly furnished for the marriage table
Methinks another chef might have whisked our desperate eggs together as one

Well, I'll tell you
The fruit of life can't always taste like sweet persimmons
Sometimes it's hard to swallow I'm afraid
But when life has handed you some lemons
Then hand it back a mug of lemonade

My father said this to me
That he did and then he blew me
Away with wisdom simple and concise
He said, "Eggbert, life is merely what you make of it
So heed this sound advice"

You make wine from sour grapes
You got a flat pancake, hey, call it a crepe
When life gives you eggs, make an omelette
You get cola from a nut
A dirty worm makes silk from out of his butt
When life gives you eggs, make an omelette
Omelette


When it looks like you should quit
Find another way of looking at it
Father!

How?

Make an omelette
Make an omelette
Make an omelette now

Take that egg and beat it
Take that egg and beat it
You gotta heat it and beat it, before you eat it
So beat that egg
Beat that egg
Beat that egg

We really beat that omelette
