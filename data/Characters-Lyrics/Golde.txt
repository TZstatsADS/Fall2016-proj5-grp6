Tevye? Tevye wake up

Where is who? What are you talking about?
What's the matter with you Tevye? Fruma Sarah's been dead for years! You must have been dreaming. Tell me what
you dreamed and I'll tell you what it meant.

Motel?
A tailor? She must have heard wrong. She meant a butcher.

But we announced it already!
We made a bargain with the butcher!

Aye
Aye 
Aye
Aye

Such a dark and evil spirit!Let it fall into the river, let it sink into the earth!
Such a dark and horrible dream!
And to think, it was brought on by that butcher!
If my grandma Tzietl, may she rest in peace,
Took the time to come all the way from the other world to tell us
About the tailor all I can say is that it's for the best.
And couldn't possibly get any better. Amen.

A blessing on my head
Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
My Grandma Tzietl said
Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov
We'll have a son-in-law
Like no-one ever saw
The tailor Motel Camzoil
The tailor, Motel Camzoil


"What??? He's poor! He has nothing, absolutely nothing!"

Do I what?

Do I love you?
With our daughters getting married
And this trouble in the town
You're upset, you're worn out
Go inside, go lie down!
Maybe it's indigestion


You're a fool

Do I love you? 
For twenty-five years I've washed your clothes
Cooked your meals, cleaned your house
Given you children, milked the cow
After twenty-five years, why talk about love right now?

I was shy

So was I

I'm your wife


Do I love him?
For twenty-five years I've lived with him
Fought him, starved with him
Twenty-five years my bed is his
If that's not love, what is?
I suppose I do
