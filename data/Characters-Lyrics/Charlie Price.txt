This is time for a shake-up,
Look at me wake up, taking control.
This is a new beginning, my gears are spinning,
Let’s rock’n’roll.
Just put. One foot. Onward and forward.
I used to be a zero but now I clearly feel that
I may be the hero who reinvents the heel.
I may be facing the impossible,
I may be chasing after miracles.
And there may be the steepest mountain to overcome.
But this is step one.
Yeah this is step one.
Who knew I had it in me,
Let me begin, see where this could go.
I’ve got knowledge and know how,
Don’t stop the show now,
Don’t stop the flow.
Just put. One foot. Onward and forward.
I used to live in limbo never dying to begin.
But now it’s sink or swim, so I’d better dive right in.
I may be facing the impossible,
I may be chasing after miracles.
And there may be the steepest mountain to overcome.
But this is step one.
It’s not just a factory. This is my family.
No one’s gonna shut us down.
Not while Charlie Price is around.
We may be facing the impossible,
We may be chasing after miracles.
And there may be the steepest mountain to overcome.
We may be facing the impossible,
We may be chasing after miracles.
And there may be the steepest mountain to overcome.
But this is step one.
Look what Charlie Boy has done.
This is step one.
You were always telling me
What I need to be
But you never really had much faith in me
Dad you gave up the factory
Well, this time I'm gonna take that chance
Leap in to the vast expanse
This time I'm gonna seize my destiny
My destiny
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah
Say yeah
Say yeah
You can throw out the old way
'Cause it's been done
Witness the future of Price & Son
Well we've got your solution
Get it on!
And get it step
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah
Let me hear you say yeah
Say yeah
Welcome to our future
No longer are we making shoes
We are making two and a half feet of irrestistable,
tubular, sex
So let's do it!
Can you picture this?
A glamorous, fashion exhibition
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah
Now if you are with this let's
Everybody
Say yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah
Say yeah
Say yeah

I'm bad news, a black and blues-er
Who's a loser, a merry-go-round spiraling down
I'm all used up, chaffed and chewed up
Who's just screwed up, the same old Charlie hitting the ground

Cause I'll never be the soul of a man, noble and wise
Like the soul of a man who lifted me high
Soul of a man, heroic and true
Like the soul of a man I looked up to
What else could I do

Stupid Hubris, no excuses
I blew my fuses, I guess I'm just a ruse in my fathers shoes
Not amusing, no confusing this streak of losing
Totally brutal and useless too

How can I be the soul of a man, noble and wise
Like the soul of a man who lifted me high
Soul of a man, heroic and true
Like the soul of a man that I looked up to
What else could I

Just when I'm reaching for that rung at the top
On that broken heel steady, ready ready to drop

When will I be the soul of a man, noble and wise
Like the soul of a man who lifted me high
Soul of a man, heroic and true
Like the soul of a man I looked up to
What else could I do

I'll never be, no I'll never be
I have gone and let you down
Whoa, soul, soul of a man
Here comes that familiar sound
Same old Charlie hitting the ground
