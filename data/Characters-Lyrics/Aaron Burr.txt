That depends. Who’s asking?
I’m getting nervous
You punched the bursar
It was my parents’ dying wish before they passed
Can I buy you a drink?
While we’re talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less
Smile more
Don’t let them know what you’re against or what you’re for

You wanna get ahead?
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead
…like I said…
Good luck with that: you’re takin’ a stand
You spit. I’m ‘a sit. We’ll see where we land

Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I’m with you, but the situation is fraught
You’ve got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you’re gonna get shot!

Let him be
Alexander, please!

Ladies and gentlemen!


The moment you’ve been waiting for!
The pride of Mount Vernon!

George Washington!

Your excellency, sir!
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west
Well—
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

Sir?



How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton’s skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? We’re
Reliable with the

There are so many to deflower!
Looks! Proximity to power
They delighted and distracted him
Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him!
A winter’s ball
And the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all
Yo, if you can marry a sister, you’re rich, son





Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it


My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher


But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya


My mother was a genius

My father commanded respect

When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect
I am the one thing in life I can control
I am inimitable
I am an original

I’m not falling behind or running late

I’m not standing still
I am lying in wait

Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb
He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose


Hamilton’s pace is relentless
He wastes no time
What is it like in his shoes?

Hamilton doesn’t hesitate
He exhibits no restraint
He takes and he takes and he takes
And he keeps winning anyway
He changes the game
He plays and he raises the stakes
And if there’s a reason
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit—


I'm willing to wait for it


I'm willing to wait for it...

Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes

We rise
We fall

And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to—

I'm willing to wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for...
I'm willing to—

Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to—


Wait for it...


Wait for it...	 
[WOMEN]
Wait for it...


Wait for it...

Wait for it...

Wait for it...

Wait for it...	 

[MEN]
Wait for it...


Wait for it...

Wait for it...

Wait for it...

Wait...
Negotiate a peace…
This is commonplace, ‘specially ‘tween recruits

You have him turn around so he can have deniability

Lee, do you yield?


You shot him in the side!
Yes, he yields!

Yo, we gotta clear the field!

This should be fun
Yes, sir

Let’s ride!

How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross’ flag higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love who’s unafraid to step in!
He’s constantly confusin’, confoundin’ the British henchmen
Ev’ryone give it up for America’s favorite fighting Frenchman!






Dear Theodosia what to say to you
You have my eyes
You have your mother's name
When you came into the world you cried and it broke my heart

I'm dedicating everyday to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile, you knock me out I fall apart and I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you
We'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you
We'll give the world to you and you'll blow us all away
Someday x2
Yeah you'll blow us all away
Someday x2

My father wasn't around

I'll make a million mistakes

After the war I went back to New York

I finished up my studies and I practiced law

Even though we started at the very same time
Alexander Hamilton began to climb
How to account for his rise to the top?
Maaaaan, the man is
Non-stop!	 
Co-counsel
Hamilton, sit down
Our client Levi Weeks is innocent. Call your first witness
That’s all you had to say!
Why do you assume you’re the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you’re the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you’re the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom!
Why do you write like you’re running out of time?
Write day and night like you’re running out of time?
Ev’ry day you fight, like you’re running out of time

Keep on fighting. In the meantime—	[ENSEMBLE]
Why do you write like you’re running out of time?


Ev’ry day you fight, like you’re running out of time



Non-stop!


Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention:

There as a New York junior delegate:
Goes and proposes his own form of government!

His own plan for a new form of government!	 

Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!

Why do you always say what you believe?
Why do you always say what you believe?
Ev’ry proclamation guarantees free ammunition for your enemies!

Alexander?

It’s the middle of the night

Is this a legal matter?

What do you need?
Okay

Who’s your client?
No

No way!

No one will read it

And if it fails?
The constitution’s a mess

It’s full of contradictions

No. No way
Good night
What?

Of course

And what if you’re backing the wrong horse?
I’ll keep all my plans
Close to my chest


I’ll wait here and see
Which way the wind
Will blow
I’m taking my time
Watching the
Afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow.	 
Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!

How do you write like you’re
Running out of time?
Write day and night like you’re
Running out of time?


Why do you assume you’re the smartest in the room? Why do you assume you’re the smartest in the room? Why do you assume you’re the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude’s gonna be your doom!
Why do you fight like you’re running out of time?

Why do you fight like
History has its eyes on you…
