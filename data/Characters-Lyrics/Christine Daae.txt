In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice that calls to me and speaks my name
And do I dream again for now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
He`s there, the phantom of the opera
I remember there was mist
swirling mist upon a vast, glassy lake
There were candles all around,
and on the lake there was a boat,
and in the boat there was a man

Who was that shape in the shadows?
Whose is the face in the mask?
Raoul, I've been there
to his world of unending night
To a world with the daylight dissolves into darkness...
darkness...
Raoul, I've seen him!
Can I ever forget that sight?
Can I ever escape from that face?
So distorted, deformed, it was hardly a face
in that darkness...
darkness...
But his voice filled my spirit
with a strange, sweet sound...
In that night there was music in my mind...
And through music my soul began to soar!
And I heard as I'd never heard before...
Yet in his eyes
all the sadness of the world
Those pleading eyes,
that both threaten and adore
Say you love me every waking moment,
turn my head with talk of summertime...
Say you need me with you now and always...
Promise me that all you say is true
that's all I ask of you
All I want is freedom,
a world with no more night
and you, always beside me, to hold me and to hide me...
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime...
say the word and I will follow you...
(right) BOTH:
Share each day with me,
each night, each morning...
(right) CHRISTINE
Say you love me...
You were once my one companion
You were all that mattered
You were once a friend and father
Then my world was shattered

Wishing you were somehow here again
Wishing you were somehow near
Sometimes it seem if I just dream
Somehow you would be here

Wishing I could hear your voice again 
Knowing that I never would
Dreaming of you won't help me to do
All that you dreamed I could

Passing bells and sculpted angels
Cold and monumental
Seem for you the wrong companions
You were warm and gentle

Too many years
Fighting back tears
Why can't the past just die

Wishing you were somehow here again
Knowing we must say goodbye
Try to forgive teach me to live 
Give me the strength to try
No more memories no more silent tears
No more gazing across the wasted years
Help me say goodbye'.
Angel . . . or father . . .
Friend . . . or
Phantom . . . ?
Who is it there,
Staring . . . ?
Angel . . . oh, speak . . .
What endless longings
Echo in this whisper . . .!
