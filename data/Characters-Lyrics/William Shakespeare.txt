Shall I compare thee
Yeah!
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
And the rough winds shake the darling buds of May, yeah
And summer's lease
I adore the adoration
Though others may abhor it
It's quite a new sensation
What shall we call it?
I am the will of the people now
I am the will of the people now
Can you feel it? (Yeah, woo)
I can feel it too
In fact, I'd like to feel you a little bit later
Do you want more? (Yeah)
When do you want it?
Tomorrow? (No)
Later (No)

Let me hear you say now! (Now!)
Let me hear you say now is! (Now is!)
Let me hear you say now is the! (Now is the!)
Oh do it with me
Now is the winter of our discontent

Made glorious summer by this sun of York
Let me hear you say
Glorious (Glorious)
Do you mean me? (Glorious)
Well I can't be (Glorious)
Now let me see g-l-o-r-i-o-u-s
Who fits that bill?
Yes
There's a feeling going round
Does anybody call it?

Methinks you got it
I am the will of the people now

I am the will of the people now
Huzzah! (Huzzah!)
Oh that is music to my ears
And if music be the food of love, play on
That's a new one, don't even know where to put it yet
Speaking of love, here's one for all you lovers out there

Soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
Thank you
It is the east and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, ah, the moon.
Who is already sick and pale
So sick and so pale with grief
That thou her maid art far more fair than she
Than she (Ahhh)
Thank you, I like that one too

I am the Will with the skill to thrill you with my quill
I am the hardworking bard you got, yeah
I am the Will (He is the Will)
I am the Will (He is the Will)
I am the man you wanna see up on the bill (Bill, bill)
I am the star b-a bard
The chosen one that heaven smiled upon (Thank you God)
If you wanna see perfection on any given day,
You know what they say
When there's a will, there's a way (Will Power)
When there's a will, there's a way (Will Power)
Will Power (Will Power!)
Good night
Good night
Parting is such sweet sorrow
My days are so busy it's making me dizzy
There's so much I gotta do
There's lunches and meetings and poetry readings
and endless interviews
Gotta pose for a portrait
and how I deplore sitting there for eternity
Then it's off to the inn
Where my innkeeper friend
Wants to name a drink after me
Then it's back to my room, where I resume
My attempt to write a hit
Just me and my beer and the terrible fear
That I might be losing it

And it's hard,
It's hard,

It's really hard
So very very hard
I make it look easy but honey believe me
It's hard
It's hard,
It's so
It's hard to be the bard

Honestly, I don't know how I do it. There's only so much of me to go around.

I've got so many fans
With so many demands
I can hardly go take a piss

Be it theater-freak or
The autograph-seeker
They all want a piece of this
It's a cross that I bear,
I'm like Jesus, I swear
It's a burden but I suffer through it

It's all part of the game,
The trappings of fame
But somebody's gotta do it
And I know, I know, I gotta go
And get back to my pen and ink
Oh don't make me do it,
Don't make me go through it
Can somebody get me a drink!

'Cause it's hard
It's hard,
It's really really hard
It's sexy but it's hard
This bar that I'm
Raising to be this amazing!
It's hard,
It's hard,
It's so
SHAKESPEARE:
It's hard to be the bard, baby

I know writing made me famous, but being famous is just so much more fun. You see...

What people just don't understand
Is that writing's demanding
It's mentally challenging and it's a bore
It's such a chore
TO sit in a room by yourself

Oh my god, I just hate it!

And you're trying to find
An opening line or a brilliant idea
And you're pacing the floor
And hoping for just a bit of divine intervention
That one little nugget that one little spark
Then Eureka! You find it you're ready to start
So now you can write, right? Wrong!
You're not even close, you remember that damn it,
Your play's gotta be in iambic pentameter!
So you write down a word but it's not the right word,
So you try a new word but you hate the new word
And you need a good word but you can't find the word
Oh where is it, what is it, what is it, where is it!
Blah-blah-blah, ha ha, ah-ha -UGHHHHHHHH!

Hello.
Did he see me losing it?
Oh, good. Then he only saw half of it. You see what I did? Ha ha. Speak, man. What news?
That sneaky little thief! Why doesn't he come up with his own ideas!?


No. It is, isn't it?
It's really the worst

Makes me wonder why I didn't think of that first
SHAKESPEARE:
Hard to alleviate the pressure to create
Hard to do something as good as the last thing I did that was already great
It's hard,
Well I'll hoist him by his petard
All I need is a clever disguise
I'll make him pay for those devious lies

Let him do all the tedious stuff
The work that's terribly and unbearably hard
Cause it's hard
It's hard
I've got fortune and fame
Everyone knows my name
I can't help it if it's so freakin' hard
I should really take these before this turns ugly
I don't know
I thought the whole breakfast theme was really strong
Everyone loves breakfast
