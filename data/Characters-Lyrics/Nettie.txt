Goin' down by the river
Gonna play with you.
No lip from the woman when they chug that beer.
Celie not feelin' good, pa. She's goin' as fast as she can.
Pa
Celie!
And finally celie enters, fourteen years old and hugely pregnant. Pa stomps on to
Church followed by a handsome man who has his eye on nettie. The man's children
Are with him. Nettie goes to help celie.
Celie
I'm sorry, pa.
As nettie and celie walk past, the church ladies stop celie. Pa looks back for nettie.
Pa
Nettie!
Jarene

Hope i find out soon.
What you want?

Ain't no need to discuss.

Someday, i guess.
We'll live in big houses.
Braid up your gray hair

Dear celie, dear celie, dear celie,

Dear celie, oh, i love you.
Years go by and still you're with me.
All we share is one big sky.
I pray for your reply.
I teach your children a-b-cs
For a missionary family.
These babies sent by god are yours,

I vibrated like a bell
When i saw the african coast.
And i kneeled down and thanked god.



For letting us see the land
Where our mothers and fathers died.
African homeland, homeland.
Nettie & celie
Land of my people, people,

We are going to be working with a tribe called the olinka.

Happy
At the center
Of the universe.
Chief, villagers, celie & kids
Linga



We are
Chief, villagers, celie & kids
Oba
Happy

At the center
Of the universe.
Chief & villagers
Oh dee dee oo day oo day oo dadoo day doo da day
Oh dee dee oo day oo day oo dadoo day doo da day
Oh yoo doh doo day ay ay
It was like black seeing black
For the first time.
Shiny blue black people looking real fine
In brilliant blue robes
That fly on the winds
Like a beautiful quilt
Stitched together by friends.
They think i should be married.
African wives (nodding in agreement)
Whoop!
Girl ain't nothing with no man.
Why you makin' a big fuss?
Whoop!
Need a husband and children
Or you're gonna be nothing.
I am nobody's mother
But i am somebody.
African wives
Girls don't need education.
Sound like the white folks back home.
African wives
Best be knowing your station.
Our village was destroyed by the white soldiers, so now we have walked with so
Many other refugees to a tent camp across the border. I don't know how i will mail
This letter.
We walk away from this ravaged land
With courage deep in our hearts
To face the unknown
We'll find a place where we can be,
Where spirit rise and soul is free.
Oh, people,
My people
I have faith that god will let us see each other again before we die. And you must
Have faith too, celie. I only hope when that day comes, we are not too old to
Recognize each other. Your sister,
