All you have to do is touch my hand
To show me you understand
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful

Anytime my little world is blue
I just have to look at you
And everything seems to be
Some kind of wonderful

I know I can't express
This feeling of tenderness
There's so much I want to say
But the right words just don't come my way

I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful

Some kind of wonderful
(Sweet lips)
Some kind of wonderful
Wonderful, wonderful
(Warm eyes)
(Soft sighs)
Some kind of wonderful

Some kind of wonderful
(Sweet lips)
Some kind of wonderful
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful
(Warm eyes)
Some kind of wonderful
(Soft sighs)

My tears are fallin' 'cause you've taken her away
And though it really hurts me so
There's something that I've gotta say

Take good care of my ba-a-a-by
Please don't ever make her blu-u-u-ue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinking of her
In everything you say and do-o-o-o

Aww, take good care of my ba-a-a-by
Now don't you ever make her cry-y-y-y
Just let your love surround her
Paint a rainbow all around her
Don't let her see a cloudy sky

Once upon a time that little girl was mine
If I'd been true, I know she'd never be with you

So, take good care of my ba-a-a-by
Be just as kind as you can be-e-e-e
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me
Well, take good care of my ba-a-a-by
Be just as kind as you can be-e-e-e
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me
Aww, take good care of my ba-a-a-by
Well, take good care of my ba-a-a-by
[Fade]
Just, take good care of my ba-a-a-by
When this old world starts getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right in to space
On the roof it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below can't bother me
Let me tell you now
When I come home feelin' tired and beat 
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet
I get away from the hustling crowds
And all that rat race noise down in the street
On the roof's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Oh, let's go 
up on the roof
At night the stars put on a show for free
And darling, you can share it all with me
I keep a-telling you
Right smack down in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble proof
So if this world starts getting you down
there's room enough for two up on the roof
Up on the roof
Everyhting's all right
Up on the roof
Oh, come on baby
Up on the roof
Up on the roof
The local rock group down the street
Is trying hard to learn their song
They serenade the weekend squire
Who just came out to mow his lawn

Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
Charcoal burning everywhere
Rows of houses that are all the same
And no one seems to care

See Mrs. Gray, she's proud today
Because her roses are in bloom
And Mr. Green, he's so serene
He's got a TV in every room

Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
Here in status symbol land
Mothers complain about how hard life is
And the kids just don't understand

Creature comfort goals
They only numb my soul
And make it hard for me to see

My thoughts all seem to stray
To places far away
I need a change of scenery

Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
Charcoal burning everywhere
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
Here in status symbol land

Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
