I'd like to say a thing or two
About this song I sing for you
These are not the words you thought you knew
To Happy Days Are Here Again

There's a reason for the switch
I'm making a creative pitch
With the words I wrote without a hitch
To Happy Days Are Here Again

I came to show you my style
My name is Cynthia Weil
W-E-I-L

My lyrics will be slick and smart
Reminding you of Lorenz Hart
And we'll both sing when we top the chart
Happy Days Are Here Again!

Take me home!

You want a sonnet
I'll get right on it
I like a good rhyme
More than a good time
My pen's on fire
And I'm for hire

Donny let me write for you
It isn't done! It's like something out of a Baulsak novel
ok I'll move in with you! Maybe that'll hold you
When he's near me, I'll kiss him 
when he leaves me woah 
I'll miss him
I won't really care
Oooo
Like walking in the rain
And wishing on the stars
Hey, ain't it good to know that you've got a friend?
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you
