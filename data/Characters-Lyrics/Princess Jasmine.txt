A princess must say this.
A princess must marry a total stranger, its absurd!
Suitors talk of love, but it’s an act 
Merely meant to throw me
How can someone love me when, in fact
They don’t know me’
They want my royal treasure, 
When all is said and done.
It’s time for a desperate measure
So I wonder
Why shouldn’t I fly so far from here?
I know the girl I might become here
Sad and confined
And always locked behind these palace walls
Is that a promise?
You do?
If a new emotion comes my way
What would be your suggestion?
Why shouldn’t I fly so far from here?
I know the girl I might become here
Follow your heart or you might end up cold and callous
Love comes to those who go and find it
If you've a dream then stand behind it
Maybe there’s more beyond these palace walls
What if I dared?
What if I tried?
Am I prepared for what’s outside?
Why shouldn’t I fly so far from here?
Something awaits beyond these palace walls
Something waits beyond these palace walls
Only ever hour of every day
Or fathers to obey.
Maybe we'll travel on the sea.
Watch the waves roll on endlessly,
We'll leave all thoughts about the future,
'Till some future day. 
Follow wherever the wind starts blowing.
A million miles away.
If I go with you, will it be safe?
What did you just say?
I'm not sure why, but...yes]
A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here, it's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky
A whole new world
A hundred thousand things to see
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back
To where I used to be
Every turn a surprise
Every moment gets better
A whole new world
A hundred thousand things to see
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back
To where I used to be
Every turn a surprise
Every moment gets better
A whole new world
That's where we'll be
A wondrous place...
