I have long wished to have this happiness
Ever since the Naryshkins' ball
Where I had the well-remembered pleasure of seeing you
How do you like the performance?
Last week Semenova fell down on the stage

And do you know, Natasha
We are having a costume tournament soon
You ought to come, please come!

You ought to come, please come!

And I never remove my smiling eyes
From your face, your neck, your bare arms
And I never remove my smiling eyes
From your face, your neck, your bare arms

And I look you in the eye

At first I did not like it much
Because what makes a town pleasant
Ce sont les jolies femmes
Isn't that so?
But now I like it very much indeed
Do come to the costume tournament Countess,
Do come!
You will be the prettiest there
You will be the prettiest there
Do come, dear Countess, and give me this flower as a pledge

We are speaking of most ordinary things

It's all right, Natasha, I'm here
It's all right, Natasha, I'm here


Good evening Pierre
Studying?

Lovely
Natalya Rostova was there

Yes, charming
Look, Dolokhov's coming round and we are off to the Club
Will you come old man?

Lend me fifty rubles?
Just no more unmarried heiresses!
So plain and boring
Nevermind about that now, 
It doesn't matter, I don't give a damn
Just as a duck is made to swim in water
God has made me as I am
All I care for is gaiety and women
And there's no dishonor in that
As long as there's money and vodka
I'll keep a feather in my hat
Oh! This is horribly stupid

Just wait till you're close enough
You'll never hit him from forty paces
Pierre, hold your fire
Pierre, hold your fire
Pierre, not yet!

Pierre, stand back!
Natasha, Natasha
Her arms, her shoulders
Her neck, her feet

I will make love to her

You know, I adore little girls,
They lose their heads at once

Ask her to dinner, eh?
Sweet sister

Waiting at the door
Waiting at the door
Waiting
And there she is
You are enchanting

And I love you

And I love you
Don't lower your eyes
I love you
I am in love dear
I am in love

Gaze in my eyes
I love you
You are bewitching
What can I do
Darling what can I do
Don't speak to me of that!
When I tell you I am madly, madly, in love with you!
Is it my fault that you're enchanting?

I'm here now

Natalie!

Blocking her path, I bring her face close to mine
Is it possible that I should never see you again?
I love you madly!
Can I never?
Natalie?

Natalie?

Natalie?
Pierre, good man,
Tonight I go away, on an adventure 
You'll not be seeing me for some time
I've found a new pleasure
And I'm taking her away
I'll send you a letter from Poland

Don't talk to me of that!
I will not deprive myself of this one!
Tonight! I take her tonight!
Lend me fifty rubles?

Passports, horses, ten thousand rubles I have taken from my sister
And another ten thousand raised with Dolokhov's help 

What, teasing again?
Fool don't talk nonsense!
Go to the devil! Eh?
Really this is no time for your stupid jokes

And well I think you for it
Do you think I am not grateful?

Nonsense, nonsense!
I'm scowling and grimacing 
Didn't I explain it to you, didn't I, what?

If this marriage isn't valid
Then I'm off the hook
But if it is valid, it really doesn't matter!
No one abroad is gonna know a thing about it
Isn't that so now don't you know?
Don't talk to me, don't don't what what
Ah go to hell now!
I'm a-clutching my hair
It's the very devil!
Here, feel how it beats!

Ah mon cher, mon cher
Quel pied, quel regard!
What a foot she has, what a glance!
A goddess!

And my handsome lips
Mutter something tender to myself

It's time!
It's time!
Now then! Nearly ready? You're dawdling!
The driver is here
The driver is here
Balaga is here!

Who's that slowpoke we abuse with wild and tipsy shouts
Whoa...

Natasha
Natasha
It is essential that I see Natasha
How can I see her?

Anatole followed with his usual jaunty step
But his face betrayed anxiety

Mon cher
I don't consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that tone
Come now, this is stupid!
What what don't don't!
I didn't think of it. I never promised, because -

But how can I?
Anatole sits at a table frowning and biting his lips
Well I don't know about that, eh?
I don't know that and I don't want to
But you have used such words to me
'Scoundrel' and so on
Which as a man of honor I will not allow anyone to use
You could at least take back your words, eh?
If you want me to do as you wish?

Anatole smiled
The reflection of that base and cringing smile
Which Pierre knew so well in his wife
Revolted him
Next day Anatole left
For Petersburg!
