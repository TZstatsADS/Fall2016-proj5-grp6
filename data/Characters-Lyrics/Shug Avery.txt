You not ugly. You the grace of god if us ever see it.
You don't believe me.
Miss celie . . . Miss celie, look here. Look at yourself.
I've always been the kind of gal
That had a lot to say.
I says the things that's on my mind,
Too dumb to shy away.
But you hush my mouth and still me
With a song i've never heard.
I guess that means that you are just
Too beautiful for words.
I've seen this life from high and low
And all that's in between.
I danced with dukes, crooned with counts,
Been courted like a queen.
But when i see what's in your heart,
All the rest is blurred.
The grace you bring into this world's
Too beautiful for words.
You hide your head under your wing
Just like a little bird.
Oh, don't you know you're beautiful,
Too beautiful for words?
Celie, you're too beautiful for words.


Now there's somethin' 'bout good lovin' that all you ladies should know.

Like you switchin on a light bulb: Watch the juice begin to flow!

Now that I've got your attention
Here's what you men need to hear:
You want your lady racin' with you

Keep the key to let her know ya find the spot to rev her best
If you dont know where it is give her the stick!
She'll do the rest! Oh Ohh Ohh!

Now if you wanna feel the train comin' yo' way!
Baby, push da button and pull the window shade!

Now listen all you red-hot lovers
You ought to know what to do!
(You oughta know what to do!)
There aint nothin' wrong with nothin'
That's right with both of you!
(That's right with both of you!)
So when tonight, you make ya lover cry out like a lion roar
Tell the neighbor your new kitten found the cream it'd been lookin' for! 
Ohh oohh yeah!

Push da button!

Yeah, but now you got me feelin' so much better, i got to get back on the road, make
Some money, you know.
In the morning. But i'll be back, too, in a month or so.
You'll see. Nobody ever love me like you.
Shug kisses celie on the lips.
Damn, girl.
Is that me i don't recognize?
Love's the one thing i knew all about,
I had it all figured out.
What about trust?
Tenderness?
What about
What about hope?
What about joy?
And what about
What about
What about
What about
