Night
And the spirit of life calling
Mamela
And a voice
With the fear of a child asking
Mamela

Wait
There's no mountain too great
Hear these words and have faith
Have faith

They live in you
They live in me

They're watching over
Everything we see
In every creature
In every star
In your reflection
They live in you

They live in you
They live in me
They're watching over
Everything we see
In every creature
In every star
In your reflection
They live in you


Yes, yes, Zazu, get on with it!

Zazu! The morning report!

What are you doing, son?
Let an old pro show you how it's done 

Stay low to the ground
Shh, not a sound 
Take it slow
One more step
Then pounce!
