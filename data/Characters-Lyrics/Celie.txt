Hey, sista, whatcha gon' do . . .
Papa don't like no screamin' 'round here,
Dear god!
Ensemble
Works!
Dear god!
Got nothin' to give you but a prayer.
God's gonna see you through.
To part with you more than I can bear
But somebody gonna love you. 

Sweet baby, sweet,
This much I know is true.
Sleep baby, sleep.
'Cause somebody gonna love you.
Oh, I'm always gonna love you.
I wanna sit and do nothing.
Make you a new dress.
Hope my babies are happy,
Someplace god will bless.
It ain't worth a big fuss.
He lookin' for a new wife take care of his mean chirren.
Maybe i'll have a garden
Where birds come to sing.
Know a finch from a sparrow,
Fix a broken wing.
Wanna hear your school bell ring.
Nettie & celie
No matter what life bring,
Us in god's hands.
She mister ol' girlfriend.
You want any kids?
Someday, i guess.
Put swings in the trees.

What is you fussin' for, mister?
What you care about 'sides yourself?
Sharp as a tack
With your hair slicked back.
Spit on your shoes,
What you tryin' to do?
Got about a million questions
Crawling around my head -
What she wear?
How her hair?
Is she skinny?
Is she stout?
Must be somethin' to fuss about.





Harpo make a lot of money if you stay here and sing.
Shug
Yeah, but now you got me feelin' so much better, i got to get back on the road, make
Some money, you know.
When you have to go?
Is that me who's floating away?
Lifted up to the clouds by a kiss,
Never felt nothin' like this.
But what about trust?
What about tenderness?
And what about
And what about hope?
What about joy?
What about
What about
What about
What about
14
What about love? . . .





Nettie!
Nettie
Dear celie, oh, i love you.
Years go by and still you're with me.
All we share is one big sky.
I pray for your reply.
I teach your children a-b-cs
For a missionary family.
These babies sent by god are yours,
Thank god
You could put everything i knew
In a thimble.
What we're taught to be
Don't resemble
The kings and queens
Who for thousands of years
Ruled magnificent cities
Washed away by tears.
Nettie.




Dear nettie, i went back home. The house was okay, but the store was a dusty mess.
But i fixed it up, and now i'm makin' pants for anybody who wants 'em. I change the
Cloth, i change the print, i change the waist, i change the pocket. Only thing i can't
Do is quit makin' 'em.
All i need's a needle and a spool of thread.
Got about a million patterns in my head.
All the ladies' legs are gonna love to dance
When they in miss celie's pants.
Styles that make you look like a queen.

But look . . .
I said, look . . .
Are you lookin'? . . .
Celie looks around at all of them and sings to shug.

Look who's wearing the pants now!
Everyone
Who dat say
Who dat say
Who dat?
Who dat say
Who dat say
Who dat?
Who dat say
What you say
In miss celie's pants!
I don't need you to love me,
I don't need you to love.
I got . . .
I got . . .
I got my sister.
I can feel her now,
She may not be here, but she still mine.
I know she still love me.
Got my children.
I can't hold them now,
They may not be here, but they still mine.
I hope they know i still love them.
Got my house.
It still keep the cold out.
Got my chair
When my body can't hold out.
Got my hands
Doin' good like they s'pose to,
Showin' my heart
To the folks that i'm close to.
Got my eyes.
Though they don't see as far now,
They see more 'bout how things
Really are now . . .
I'm gonna take a deep breath.
Gonna hold my head up.
Gonna put my shoulders back,
And look you straight in the eye.
I'm gonna flirt with somebody
When they walk by.
I'm gonna sing out . . .
Sing out.
I believe i have inside of me
Everything that i need to live a bountiful life.
With all the love alive in me
I'll stand as tall as the tallest tree.
And i'm
Thankful for everyday that i'm given,
Both the easy and hard ones i'm livin'.
But most of all
I'm thankful for
Loving who i really am.
I'm beautiful.
Yes, i'm beautiful,
And i'm here.



Now who that comin'?
Nettie!
My nettie home.
Dear god, dear stars, dear trees, dear sky,
Dear peoples, dear everything, dear god,
God is inside me and everyone else
That was or ever will be.
I came into this world with god
And when i finally looked inside, i found it,
Just as close as my breath is to me.
Your heart beat
Make my heart beat
I don't think us feel old at all.
I think this is the youngest us ever felt.
