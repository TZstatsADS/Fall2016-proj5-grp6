Love is a mess
So's my son, expressly to hurt me
Marvin, my ex-
You've seen him for years-
Told me over the phone to tell you my fears
Do you only treat queers?
I'm everything he wanted
It's time I put it all together
The date was set
My father let my marry
I married. I?
Then Marvin came from work
Sat me down on the bed
He told me how he loved me
How needed, that thought valued me
I have?

He said

I have
It's true

I had something rotten
Which appears thought now it's well forgo, an?
Maybe, darling, so do you
I am probably diseased

And so easily appeased

He took pains to not excited us
He explains I've?
Too

Then I stayed home from work
Took good care of my men
They faked despair, they wet their bed,
They combed their hair, they acted dead
One said?

He said?

He filled my coats
With candies and notes, with 'Will you be my valentine'?
Will you be my valentine?
This gets harder to believe
I've a scalpel up my sleeve

I've missed him; he's still missing
Don't make noise, but daddy's kissing boys

Love is blind
Love can tell a million stories
Love's unkind
Spiteful in a million ways


Darling, please see a psychiatrist.
He doesn't bite, and he might
Help you understand
Why you are so angry and despised
By all those guys
Who have not been, they have not been analyzed.

Yet, sweetheart, please do not get hysterical.
Reason will win the day, trust me!
Mother never lies.
No one is saying you're a sick neurotic,
But you could find some help.
Hear me out, please.
Yes, you could find some help,
He could help you realize

How confused you are!
Yes, it's very clear.
Daddy's sincere, but a schmo!
You and I must trust our emotions,
Make no commotions.
Will you go'

Darling, please listen to your father.
(I can't transcribe the rest of this by ear)

No.

Get thee to a psychiatrist!

With Whizzer.

He'll go!


I was supposed to make the dinner
Make it pretty on his plate
Every wife should pull her weight
Have it ready, make it tasty
And love him

This had better come to a stop doctor
This has been a lousy and horrible flop

Who is responsible?

Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop
I chopped it and served his food
The asshole forced me

And still the bastard divorced me

It isn't like he said

You probably hurt his pride

He's got to have it all

He's like a baby who's denied

I'd like to be a princess on a throne,
To have a country I can call my own.
And a king
Who's lusty and requires a fling
With a female thing.

Great... Men will be men...
Let me turn on the gas.
I saw them in the den
With Marvin grabbing Whizzer's ass.

Oh, sure, I'm sure he's sure, he did his best.
I mean, he tried (meant) to be what I was not.
The things he was are things which I've forgot.
He's a queen.
I'm a queen.
Where is our crown?

I'm breaking down.
I'm breaking down.
My life is shitty
And my kid seems like an idiot to me.
I mean, that's wrong (sick).
I mean, he's great.
It's me who is the matter,
Talking madder than the maddest hatter.
If I repeat one more word,
I swear I'll lose my brain.
What else should I explain?
Oh yes, it's true I can cry on cue
But so can you.
I'm breaking down.
I'm breaking down.
Down. Down.
You ask me "Is it fun to cry over nothing?"
It is. I'm breaking down.

(Speaking:) 
Oh, darn, don't have time for a breakdown now.
Have to get back to my banana-carrot surprise.

(She cuts her finger while chopping.)

Oh, that really hurts.

(Singing:)
Now let's consolidate our simple thoughts.
A healthy fruit is healthy till it rots.
I agree.
We sat beneath the apple tree.
Marv, his friend, and me.

Now, speaking of friends,
Whizzer is sweet and trim.
I think he sets the trends.
I think in fact I'll marry him.
He wants me!
I wanna hate him, but I really can't.
It's like a nightmare how this all proceeds.
I hope that Whizzer don't fulfill his need.
"Don't" is wrong.
Sing along.
What was the noun?

I'm breaking down.
I'm breaking down.
I'll soon redecorate these stalls.
I'd like some padding on the walls.
And also pills.
I wanna sleep.
Sure things will prob'ly worsen,
But it's not like I'm some healthy person.
I've rethought my talks with Marv,
And one fact does emerge:
I think I like his shrink.
So that is why I could use a (should turn to) drink.
I'm on the brink of breaking down.
I'm breaking down.
Down. Down.
I only want to love a man who can love me
Or like me
Or help me.

Marvin was never mine.
He took his meetings in the boys' latrine.
I used to cry.
He'd make a scene.
I'd rather die than dry clean
Marvin's wedding gown.
I'm breaking down.
I'm breaking down.
It's so upsetting when I found
That what's rectangular is round.
I mean, it stinks.
I mean, he's queer.
And me, I'm just a freak
Who needs it maybe every other week!
I've rethought the fun we had,
And one fact does emerge:
I've played a foolish clown.
The almost-virgin who sings this dirge
Is on the verge of breaking down.
I'm breaking down.
Down. Down.
The only thing that's breaking up
Is my family.

The only thing that's breaking up
Is my family.
But me, I'm breaking down. Down.

Chop chop chop chop chop
I chopped it
It's a gourmet version of chicken merengo
Took me all day
I'll say 'twas worth the time
I lie

Biblical times?

I'm tired of all the happy men who rule the world.
Their smile,
Their smiles, their pedigree.
They smile,
But not for me.
I'd like a chance to hide
In their world.

I'm happy, but I'm not at ease with that whole world.
There's trust,
He lets me move,
And lust,
Which I approve.

I need those crass, indulgent stares.
He pats my ass and says he cares.
The smile will come at will,
But still.

I'm not exactly happy,
Though he's absolutely nice.
And he caters to my family,
Sometimes for a price.
But he's cocky and he's charming,
Funny as the day is long,
And he's mine.
What's so wrong'

I'll be absolutely faithful.
He may go and play the field.
I'll stay home and smile at Jason,
All ambivalence concealed.
He must tell me how he loves me,
Make it seem like he's inspired.
And I'll roar,
Like I'm wired.

I'll explore what I'm feeling,
Accept what I'm feeling is 'tired'.
I'm tired,
So tired of all the happy men who rule the world.
I'll laugh,
Then watch us fade.
I'll laugh,
Then fire the maid.

I'm sick to try, I'm too prepared.
I'm duly warned and duly scared.
My life is now on trial.
I smile.
He decides the role to assume,
Building a life.
Books abound,
To show we care.
An easy chair,
With paintings all around.
The perfect shade of green by the door.

Food displayed
In fancy wire.
A hearth and fire
Will keep us at our best.
We will not be depressed anymore,
Anymore.

Baking the bread.

Mendel plans to rub my back
Mendel?s not a maniac
And he's sweet
And he's warm
And he loves me so
I never wanted to love you.
I only wanted to love and not be blamed.
Let me go, you should know
I'm not ashamed
To have loved you.

He hates everything!

Help us all.

I'm everything he wanted.
It's time I put it all together.
My hands were tied.
My father cried,
'You'll marry!'
I married!
Jason dear, hello.
Are you packed and waiting?
But before we go,
Let me talk with father alone.

Now as the bar mitzvah nears-
Jason, put your walkerman on and hum.
Since this is the last loving thing we?ll probably ever do together,
Let's act adult and not go crazy.

What about it?

It's a personal opinion who should cater. Shh!

Shh!

Shh!

How can you 'stop with the prayers' at a bar mitzvah?

Our child.

Yes, he is.

Yes, but so are you. Really, kiddo, so are you.

Where's my hug?

Ah?

Jason, darling, don't get nervous.
I'm right here and at your service.
Look, I'm calm and self-deluded,
Grateful cause I hope you'll do what I pray you'll do.

Not with guns, but kill your mother.


I was sure growing up I would live the life
My mother assumed I'd live
Very Jewish, very middle-class, and very straight
Where healthy men stayed healthy men
And marriages were long and great
I smile
I don't complain

I'm trying to keep sane as the rules keep changing
Families aren't what they were
Thank God there's a husband and a child whom I adore
But then there's more
So many more
There's always more

Life is never what you planned
Life is moments you can't understand
And that is life
I'm plain
I don't astound

I hold to the ground
As the ground keeps shifting
Keeping my balance square
Trying not to care about this man who Marvin loves
But that's my life
He shared my life
Yes, that's my life

Life is never what you planned
Life is moments you can't understand
And that is life

Holding to the ground
As the ground keeps shifting
Trying to keep sane
As the rules keep changing
Keeping up my head
As my heart falls out of sight
Everything will be all right
Everything will be all right
Jason, if you want a Bar Mitzvah
God knows, you can have a Bar Mitzvah
But I have to know
And I have to know now
Just what it is you want
I've addressed the invitations
Here's your chance to give me Hell
If you think it's bust
Then it's probably just
As well
So, we'll cancel the bar mitzvah?
Now what do we do?
Holding to the ground
As the ground keeps shifting
