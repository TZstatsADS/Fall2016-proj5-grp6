And roll my stockings down

Is gonna blow the blues

And want a brand-new start 
To do that -

Where there's a nightly brawl
And all that Jazz

Is where I store the juice

How could he lend an ear

Cicero.

He only had himself to blame.
If you'd have been there
If you'd have seen it
I betcha you would have done the same!

If you'd have been there

Have done the same!
If you'd have been there

My sister, Veronica, and I did this double act He had it coming
and my husband, Charlie, used to travel He had it coming
round with us. Now for the last number in He only had 
our act, we did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a Himself 
row, one, two, three, four, five... To blame.
Splits, spread eagles, back flips, flip flops, If you'd have been there
one right after the other. Well, this one night If you'd have seen it
we are in Cicero, the three of us, sittin' up I betcha 
in a hotel room, boozin' and havin' a few You would 
laughs and we ran out of ice, Have done 
so I went out to get some. The same!
I come back, open the door He had 
And there's Veronica and It coming
Charlie doing Number Seventeen He had 
-the spread eagle. It coming...
Well, I was in such a state of shock, I completely blacked out. 
I can't remember a thing. It wasn't until later, when I was 
washing the blood off my hands I even knew they were dead.
They had it coming
They had it coming 
They had it coming
They had it coming
They had it coming
They took a flower
All along
In its prime
I didn't do it
And then they used it
But if I'd done it
And they abused it
How could you tell me
It was a murder
That I was wrong? But not a crime!
The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum

Liz, Annie, Mona: Velma, June, Hunyak:
They had it comin'
They had it comin'
They had it comin'
They had it comin'
They had it comin'
They had it comin'
All along
All along
'Cause if they used us
'Cause if they used us
And they abused us
And they abused us
How could you tell us
How could you tell us
That we were wrong? 
That we were wrong?


He had it coming
He had it coming
He only had 
Himself 
To blame.
If you'd have been there
If you'd have seen it
I betcha 
You would 
Have done 
The same!
Number Seventeen - the spread eagle.
I betcha you would have done the same!


My sister and I had an act that couldn't flop
My sister and I were headed straight for the top
My sister and I eared a thou a week at least
(Oh, sure)
But my sister is now, unfortunately, deceased

Oh, I know, it's sad, of course,
But a fact is still a fact
And now all that remains
Is the remains
Of a perfect double act!

Roxie, do you know you are exactly the same size as my sister? 
Oh, you would fit in her wardrobe perfectly. Look, why don't I 
just show you some of the act, huh?
Watch this.
(She dances)
Now, you have to imagine this with two people.
It's swell with two people.

First I'd....(Drums!)
Then she'd...(Saxophone!)
Then we'd...(Together!)
But I can't do it alone!
Then she'd...
Then I'd...
Then we'd...
But I can't do it alone!

She'd say, "What's your sister like?"
I'd say, "MEN,"
Yuk, yuk, yuk
She'd say, "you're the cat's meow"
Then we'd wow
The crowd again
When she'd go...
I'd go...
We'd go...

And then those ding-dong daddies started to roar
Whistled, stomped, and stamped on the floor
Yelling, screaming, begging for more.

And we'd say, "O.K. fellas, keep your socks up. 
You ain't seen nothing yet!"

Ah, aha, yeah!
But I simply cannot do it alone.

Well? What did ya think? Come on, you can say.

O.K. O.K. The first part can always be rewritten. But the 
second part was really nifty. Watch this!

Then she'd...(See, get it, right?)
Then I'd...(Then I kick really high...)
Then we'd...
But I can't do it alone!
She'd say, "What state's Chicago in?"
I'd say, "ILL!"
Did ya get that?
She'd say, "turn your motor off!"
I can hear 'em cheerin' still
When she'd go...
I'd go...
We'd go...
And then those two-bit Johnnies did it up brow
To cheer the best attraction in town
They really tore the balcony down

And we'd say, "O.K. fellas, O.K., we're goin' home, but 
here's a few more partin' shots!" And this...this we did 
in perfect unison.

Cymbals crash crash crash
Now, you've seen me goin' through it
You can see there's nothin' to it
But I simply cannot do it
Alone!


One thing I know
And I've always known

I am my own
Best friend

Baby's alive
But baby's alone

And baby's her own

Best friend
Many's the guy
Who told me he cares
But they were scratchin' my back
'Cause I was scratchin' theirs

And trusting to luck

Only for fools

I play in a game

Where I make the rules
And rule number one
From here to the end
Is 'I am my own best friend'

Three musketees
Who never say die
Are standing here this minute

Me

Myself

And I!
If life is a school
I'll pass every test
If life is a game
I'll play it the best
'Cause I won't give in
and I'll never bend
and I am my own best friend!
Can you imagine?
I mean can you imagine?
Do you believe it?
I mean, do you believe it?
I know a girl
A girl who lands on top
You could put her face
Into a pail of slop
And she'd come up smelling like a rose
How she does it, heaven knows.
She is.
I know a girl
A girl with so much luck
She could get run over by a two-ton truck
Then brush herself off and walk away
How she does it, I couldn't say
Whilst I on the other hand
Put my face in a pail of slop
And I would smell like a pail of slop
I, on the other hand
Get run over by a truck
And I am deader than a duck
I know a girl who tells so many lies
Anything that's true would truly cross her eyes
But what that mouse is selling
That whole world buys
And nobody smells a rat.
The two of us?
Can you imagine?
I mean, can you imagine?
Do you believe it?
I mean, do you believe it?
"My dear little baby."
"My sweet little..."
Billy, I been thinkin' a lot about my trial. Couldn't I just 
show you what I thought I might do on the witness stand?
Good! Hit it!
Well then, when I got on the stand I thought I'd take a peek 
at the jury. Then I'd cross my legs like this, you know.
Then, when Harrison cross examines me, I thought I'd give 'em 
this...and then if he yells at me I thought I'd tremble like 
this..."ooh, no, please stop!"
Then, I thought I'd let it all be too much for me, like real 
dramatic. Then, I thought I'd get thirsty and say, "Please, 
someone, could I have a glass of water?"
Ah! Ah! Ah! Then, I thought I'd cry. Buckets. Only I don't 
have handkerchief - that's when I have to ask you for yours! 
I really like that part. Don't you? Then, I get up and try to
walk; oh, but I'm too weak, and I slump and I slump and I 
slump and I slump until finally, I faint!
They sure ain't, Mama. They sure ain't. It's all gone.
Whatever happened to fair dealing?
And pure ethics
And nice manners?
Why is it everyone now is a pain in the ass?
Whatever happened to class?
Class!
Ah, there ain't no gentlemen
To open up the doors
There ain't no ladies now,
There's only pigs and whores
And even kids'll knock ya down
So's they can pass
Nobody's got no class!
Whatever happened to old values?
And good breeding?
Class
Ah, there ain't no gentlemen
That's fit for any use
And any girl'd touch your privates
For a deuce
And even kids'll kick your shins and give you sass
Nobody's got no class!
All you read about today is rape and theft
Nobody's got no class
'S got his brains in his crotch
Holy crap
What a shame
What became of class?
You can like the life you're living
You can live the life you like
You can even marry Harry
But mess around with Ike
And that's
Good, isn't it?
Grand, isn't it?
Great, isn't it?
Swell, isn't it?
Fun, isn't it?
But nothing stays
In fifty years or so
It's gonna change, you know
But, oh, it's heaven
Nowadays
And that's
Good, isn't it?
Grand, isn't it?
Great, isn't it?
Swell, isn't it?
Fun, isn't it?
But nothing stays
In fifty years or so
It's gonna change, you know
But, oh, it's heaven
Nowadays
