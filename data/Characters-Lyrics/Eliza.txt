Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Hey!
Ohh, I do I do I do I
Dooo! Boy you got me	[ALL WOMEN]
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin’ at my sister as she’s dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went “Boom!”
Tryin’ to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody’s dancin’ and the band’s top volume

Grab my sister, and
Whisper, “Yo, this
One’s mine.”

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking “What’s she gonna do?”
She grabbed you by the arm, I’m thinkin’ “I’m through”
Then you look back at me and suddenly I’m
Helpless!

Oh, look at those eyes

Oh!
Yeah, I’m
Helpless, I know




I’m so into you
I am so into you


I know I’m down for the count
And I’m drownin’ in ‘em.	 



Thank you for all your service
I’m writin’ a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin’ at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin’
My father’s stone-faced
While you’re asking for his blessin’
I’m dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I’m tryin’ not to cry
‘cause there’s nothing that your mind can’t do
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
“we’re through”
But then he shakes your hand and says
“Be true”
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I’m
Helpless!



Helpless!
Hoo!



That boy is mine
That boy is mine!


Helpless! Helpless!
Down for the count
And I’m drownin’ in em	 
I do I do I do I do!


I do I do I do I do!


Hey, yeah, yeah!

I’m down for the count
I’m—


I look into your eyes, and the sky’s the limit
I’m



…drownin’ in ‘em.	
Helpless



Helpless.

Elizabeth Schuyler, it's a pleasure to meet you.

Thank you for all your service.

Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around…

A month or so

I wrote to the General a month ago

I begged him to send you home

I’m not sorry


I knew you’d fight
Until the war was won

But you deserve a chance to meet your son
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now.	 
I relish being your wife
Look around, look around…

Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you’re alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough

And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough

I don’t pretend to know
The challenges you’re facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind

But I’m not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough

We don’t need a legacy
We don’t need money
If I could grant you peace of mind
If you could let me inside your heart…

Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay
And I could be enough
And we could be enough
That would be enough


Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you’re alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if your wife could share a fraction of your time
If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?


Alexander…

Alexander—

Helpless…

Look around, isn’t this enough?

What would be enough

To be
Satisfied
Satisfied
Satisfied…
Look around
Look around!
Isn’t this enough?
What would be enough?
Why do you fight like
History has its eyes on you...
