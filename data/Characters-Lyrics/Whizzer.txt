Ah-ah
Hah!
Half Jewish.
I'm Whizzer.
We charge ahead to show?
Excel in bed.
I want the bed!
I lost it twice.
I'm nauseous
Pick up all your clothes
Whizzer knows
Make me sick
God you're impossible
We've been together for nine months
Nine Months
Nine months
While I put the steak in?
Won't
Everything he owns is vile
Marvin doesn't care
A whit
Marvin doesn't share
My devotion to
Style
Men from France can cancel a debt
Men in cufflinks make me forget my name
I intend to upset
This regrettable game
Isn't that a French lapel?
Send me flowers
Make them roses
See how quickly he sours
Pick up your clothes, Marvin breeding shows Marvin
We fit like a glove
Passion dies
But I'd kill for that thrill of first love
Still it's awfully trying?
Leave me
Don't be a fool
Feed me
What I love I devour
I was trained in karate
We've been together for nine months-
Nine months
Nine months
True, but
I would kill for that thrill of first love
I would kill for that thrill of first love-
I would kill for that thrill of first
Marvin at the Psychiatrist, a three-part mini opera. Part One.
Part Two.
Part Three.
I'm not sure, Jason. Jason, maybe so. Absolutely, Jason.
He'll go'
Late for dinner, late again
I'm not responsible
Why is it always ourselves who have to change?

The psychiatrist returning
Returning
Five sessions later

March
March
March
March
Whizzer says it doesn't dearie
Don't be scared
Don't get tight
Asses bared
My delight
Shared-
Young
Yes I know
Here I go

Please don't watch me?
I can do it
Shit
I blew it
Maybe you could show me where
I fear I've lost my head
No I don't
I can think it through myself
I'll go first
No sir
Where?
Here?
Who?

Who?
Except sex
And money
Quite alright
Take a turn
Move the pawn
Move the pawn
Take my hand
Play the game
Force? the pity
Since you need a man
Who's brainy
Maybe sometimes I'm afraid
The maid is more your style
He goes to school at night
English Lit
What should I do now?
Where?
How should I behave myself?
Maybe we should call it quits
Let me win?
Please?
Thanks!
Whizzer wins!
Whizzer wins!
Checkmate

Except sex
And money
And money
And money
And money
And money
Whizzer's supposed to make the dinner
Be a patsy, lose at chess
Always bravely acquiesce
Clip the coupons, make the dinner, and love him
Don't start explaining
I'm sick of explaining
And this had better come to a stop, Marvin/This had better come to a stop, Whizzer
Now, Marvin/Now, Whizzer
Ciao, Marvin/Ciao, Whizzer
This had better come to an end/This had better come to an end
This had better come to an end



Deceive.
This is the price,
'Should he love me?'
He has lost his mind
Marvin is not so uncouth
Marvin is not so unkind

Do I love him?
No
I never wanted to love you.
I never wanted, 'till death do we two part.'
Condescend, stay my friend.
How do I start,
Not to love you'


It bounced in.
Hit the line, you know it did.

Are you kidding'
Who's telling who how to play'

Serve it up.

Hold it down, keep him back-
Something's gone out of whack!

Ah shit!
1 2 3- damn it. Good serve, Marvin...
1 2-
It hit my heel.
No big deal, the game is yours.

I can't go on anymore!

Excuse me' I'm ready to go! I'm ready' Do you want me to reply?
Please don't get morbid

It's just-

That I haven't died yet

I'm sick, but kicking

Alright

Good night

Please go home and don't be scared

Marvin, just go home and turn on TV
Drink a little something till you're 'dead'
Think of me around
Sleeping soundly in our bed
Marvin, did you hear what I said?

There's nothing to fear

Just stay right here

I've a clue

Sky!
I love friends that hover!

Okay, when the doctor started using phrases like "You'll pass away".
What could i say? I said, 
"Doctor, in plain english tell me why was I chosen why me of al men, 
docter here's the good part at least death means 
I'll never be scared about dying again. 

Lets get on with living while we can 
And not play dunb deaths gonna come 
And when it does screw the nerves I'll be eating hors'deavres 
It's the roll of the dice and no crime, you gotta die sometime.

Death is not a friend but I hope in the end he takes me in his arms 
And lets me hold his face, 
He takes me in his arms and whispers something funny, 
He lifts me in his arms and tells me to embrace his attack.

Then the scene goes to black. Life sucks people always hate a loser 
And they hate lame ducks screw me and shucks thats it thats the ball game 
I don't smoke don't do drugs and then comes the bad news. 

I quit thats the ball game 
It's the chink in the armor the shit in the karma the blues. 
Can I keep my cool despite the urge to fall apart how should 
I start i would cry is I could but it does no damn good to explain 
I'm a man in my prime. You gotta die sometime. 

Deaths a funny pal with a weird sort of talent 
He puts his arms around my neck and walks me to the bed. 
He pins me up against the wall and kisses me like crazy the many stupid things 
I thought about with dread now delight then the scne goes to white. 

Give me the balls to orchestrate a gracful 
Leave thats my reprieve to go out without care my head high 
In the air it's the last little mountain i'll climb, 
I'll climb you gotta die sometime, 
You gotta die sometime you gotta die sometime you gotta die sometime,
Sometime, sometime, sometime. 
Somtime, sometime, sometime, sometime.

All your life you've wanted men,
And when you got it up to have them,
Who knew it could end your life?

Do you regret--?

What more can I say?

One hour more.
One hour more.

What would I do

If I had not seen you?

There are no answers. But what would I do...
