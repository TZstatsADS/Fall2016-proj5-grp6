I've learned to slam on the brake
Before I even turn the key
Before I make the mistake
Before I lead with the worst of me
Give them no reason to stare
No slipping up if you slip away
So I've got nothing to share
No, I got nothing to say

Step out, step out of the sun
If you keep getting burned
Step out, step out of the sun
Because you've learned, because you've learned

On the outside always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
I'm waving through a window
I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear

While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
I'm waving through a window
Oh, can anybody see, is anybody waving
Back at me?

We start with stars in our eyes
We start believing that we belong
But every sun doesn't rise
And no one tells you where you went wrong

Step out, step out of the sun
If you keep getting burned
Step out, step out of the sun
Because you've learned, because you've learned

On the outside always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
Waving through a window
I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
Waving through a window
Oh, can anybody see, is anybody waving?

When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound
Did I even make a sound
Did I even make a sound
It's like I never made a sound
Will I ever make a sound?

On the outside always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been
'cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
Waving through a window
I try to speak
But nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
Waving through a window
Can anybody see, is anybody waving back at me?
Oooh, is anybody waving
Waving, waving, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
End of May or Early June
This picture perfect afternoon we shared
Drive the winding country road
Grab a scoop at A La Mode
And then we're there

An open field that's framed with trees
We pick a spot and shoot the breeze
Like buddies do

Quoting songs by our favorite bands
Telling jokes no one understands
Except us two
And we talk and take in the view

All we see is sky for forever
Let the world pass by for forever
Feels like we could go on for forever this way
Two friends on a perfect day

We walk a while and we talk about
The things we'll do when we get out of school
Bike the Appalachian trail or
Write a book
Or learn to sail
Wouldn't that be cool

There's nothing that we can't discuss
Like girls we wish would notice us but never do
He looks around and says to me
"There's nowhere else I'd rather be"
I say "me too"

And we talk and take in the view
We just talk and take in the view

All we see is sky for forever
Let the world pass by for forever
Feels like we could go on for forever this way
This way

All we see is light for forever
'Cause the sun shines bright for forever
Life will be all right for forever this way
Two friends on a perfect day

And there he goes
Racing toward the tallest tree
From far across the yellow field I hear him calling "follow me"
And there we go
Wondering how the world might look from up so high

One foot after the other
One branch then to another
I climb higher and higher
I climb until the entire
Sun shines on my face

And I suddenly feel the branch give way
I'm on the ground
My arm goes numb
I look around
And I see him coming to get me
He's coming to get me
And everything's okay

All we see is sky for forever
Let the world pass by for forever
Buddy, you and I for forever this way
This way

All we see is light
'cuz the sun shines bright
Life will be all right for forever this way
Two friends
True friends
On a perfect day




Why would you write that?
You know what? If you aren't going to take this seriously...
This has to be perfect, okay?
The emails have to prove that we were actually friends.
They've got to be completely realistic
Let's go back.
Let's go back Jared!
Shut up
Just fix it!
Well I want to show that I was a good friend,
Y'know? That I was trying to help him
Crack?!
Well I mean I can't just show them one email
I'm not hyperventilating
I'm having no trouble breathing
I'm not hyperventilating!
Dear Connor Murphy,
Yes I've also missed our talks
Stop doing drugs
Just try to take deep breaths and go on walks
I'm sending pictures of the most amazing trees
You'll be obsessed with all my forest expertise
Dude I'm proud of you
Just keep pushing through
You're turning around
I can see
What the hell?
Dear Connor Murphy, I'm just glad to be your friend
You're getting better everyday
EVAN:
He said
There's nothing like your smile
Sort of subtle and perfect and real
He said
You never knew how wonderful
That smile could make someone feel

And he knew
Whenever you get bored
You scribble stars on the cuffs of your jeans
And he noticed
That you still fill out the quizzes
that they put in those teen magazines

But he kept it all inside his head
What he saw he left unsaid
And though he wanted to
He couldn't talk to you
He couldn't find the way
But he would always say

If I could tell her
Tell her everything I see
If I could tell her
How she's everything to me
But we're a million worlds apart
And I don't know how I would even start
If I could tell her
If I could tell her

About you?

No, no, no, he said so many things,
I'm just trying to remember the best ones.
You looked really pretty, er-
It looked pretty cool when you put indigo streaks in your hair
And he wondered how you learned to dance
Like all the rest of the world isn't there

But he kept it all inside his head
What he saw he left unsaid

If I could tell her
Tell her everything I see
If I could tell her
How she's everything to me
And I don't know how I would even start if I could tell her

If I could tell her
But what do you do
When there's this great divide
And what do you do
When the distance is too wide
And how do you say I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

But we're a million worlds apart
And I don't know how I would even start
If I could tell her
If I could

You still matter
You still matter

They need to know
I'll show them

No one deserves to be forgotten
No one deserves to fade away, to fade away
No one deserves
No one deserves to be forgotten

So maybe let that feeling wash away
Maybe there’s a reason to believe you’ll be okay
‘Cuz when you don’t feel strong enough to stand
You can reach out your hand

And oh, someone will coming running
And I know, they’ll take you home
Even when the dark comes crashing through
when you need a friend to carry you
when you’re broken on the ground
You will be found

So let the sun come streaming in
Cuz you’ll reach up and you’ll rise again
Lift your head off the ground and look around
You will be found
You will be found
You will be found
You will be found

There’s a place where we don’t have to be alone
Every time that you call out
You’re a little less alone
If you only say the word
Across the silence
Your voice is heard

Even when the dark comes crashing through
When you need a friend to carry you
When you’re broken on the ground
You will be found
So let the sun coming streaming in
Cuz you’ll reach up and you’ll rise again
If you only look around
You will be found
You will be found
You will be found

Out of the shadows, morning is breaking
All is new, all is new

Suddenly I see that
All is new, all is new
You are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone

Even when the dark comes crashing through
And you need someone to carry you
When you’re broken on the ground
You will be found
When the sun comes streaming in
You’ll reach up and you’ll rise again
If you only look around
You will be found
You will be found
You will be found
Shaving cream?
Totally
Definitely


So I give you ten thousand reasons to not let me go
But if you really see me
If you like me for me and nothing else
Well, that's all that I've wanted for longer that you could possibly know

So it can be us
It can be us
And only us
And what came before won't count anymore or matter
We can try that
Nobody else but the two of us here
It's just you and me

Wait what?


Why are you so obsessed with this?
You didn't even know him

Because he was your lab partner?
Or because, I don't know
Maybe because you want to add another extracurricular for your college application

We need more emails
Emails showing that he was getting worse
This isn't funny!

What is that supposed to mean?

I thought the only reason you even talk to me is because of your car insurance?

So? Maybe the only reason you talk to me, Jared, is because you don't have any other friends!
Great! Go ahead, do it! Tell everyone how you helped write emails pretending to be a kid who killed himself.


[?] time to think
but the book is about to sink
Can't erase what I wrote and [?]
Tell me how could you change the story?

Stop it stop it!Just let me go!

So I just stand here sorry
Searching for something to say
Something to say

Words fail, words fail
There's nothing I can say

I guess I thought I could be part of this
I never had this kind of thing before
I never had that perfect girl
who somehow could see the good part of me
And I never had the dad who stuck it out
No corny jokes or baseball gloves
No mom who just was there
'Cause mom was all that she had to be

That's not a worthy explanation
I know there is nothing
Nothing can make sense of all these things I've done

Words fail, words fail
There's nothing I can say
Except sometimes you see everything you want
And sometimes you see everything you wish you had
It's right there, right there, right there
In front of you
And you wanna believe it's true
So you make it true
And you think maybe everybody wants it
And needs it a little bit too

This was just a sad invention
It wasn't real, I know
But we were happy
I guess I couldn't let that go
I guess I couldn't give that up
I guess I wanted to believe it
'Cause if I just believe
Then I don't have to see what's really there

No, I'd rather pretend I'm something better than
These broken parts
Pretend I'm something other than this mess that I am
'Cause then I don't have to look at it
And no one gets to look at it
No one can really see

'Cause I've learned to slam on the brake
Before I even turn the key
Before I make a mistake
Before I lead with the worst of me
I never let them see the worst of me

'Cause what if everyone saw?
What if everyone knew?
Would they like what they saw?
Or would they hate it too?
Will I just keep running away from what's true?

All I ever do is run
So how do I step in
Step into the sun
Step into the sun
