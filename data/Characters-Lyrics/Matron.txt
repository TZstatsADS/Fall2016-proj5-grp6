The whole world's gone low-brow. Things ain't what they used to be.
Class.
Whatever happened to, "Please, may I?"
And "Yes, thank you?"
And "How charming?"
Now, every son of a bitch is a snake in the grass
Whatever happened to class?
Class!
Ah, there ain't no gentlemen
To open up the doors
There ain't no ladies now,
There's only pigs and whores
And even kids'll knock ya down
So's they can pass
Nobody's got no class!
And fine morals?
Now, no one even says "oops" when they're
Passing their gas
Whatever happened to class?
And even kids'll kick your shins and give you sass
Nobody's got no class!
Jesus Christ, ain't there no decency left?
Everybody you watch
Holy crap
What a shame
Mr. Flynn, the reporters are here.
Billy:
Let 'em in, Butch. Okay, Roxie, act like a dummy; you sit 
on my lap and do all the talking.
Mr. Billy Flynn sings the "Press Conference Rag" - notice 
how his mouth never moves - almost.
