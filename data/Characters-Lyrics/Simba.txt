Pouncing
Yeah, stay low! 

This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar and snort
Not a tale I distort
On the morning report
I'm gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware!
I'm gonna be the mane event
Like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my roar
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
No one saying do this
No one saying stop that
Free to do it all my way
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
Everybody look left
Everywhere you look I'm
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Oh, I just can't wait...



I'm gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware!

I'm gonna be the mane event

Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

No one saying do this

No one saying stop that

Free to do it all my way

Oh, I just can't wait to be king
Everybody look left

Everywhere you look I'm

Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

Oh, I just can't wait...




Hakuna Matata?
What's a motto?

It means no worries for the rest of your days
It means no worries for the rest of your days
Where has the starlight gone?
Dark is the day
How can I find my way home?

Home is an empty dream
Lost to the night
Father, I feel so alone

You promised you'd be there
Whenever I needed you
Whenever I call your name
You're not anywhere

I'm trying to hold on
Just waiting to hear your voice
One word, just a word will do
To end this nightmare

When will the dawning break
Oh endless night
Sleepless I dream of the day

When you were by my side
Guiding my path
Father, I can't find the way

You promised you'd be there
Whenever I needed you
Whenever I call your name
You're not anywhere

I'm trying to hold on
Just waiting to hear your voice
One word, just a word will do
To end this nightmare

I know that the night must end
And that the sun will rise
And that the sun will rise

I know that the clouds must clear
And that the sun will shine
And that the sun will shine

I know that the night must end
And that the sun will rise
And that the sun will rise
I know that the clouds must clear
And that the sun will shine
And that the sun will shine
(Repeat to end)

I know
Yes, I know
The sun will rise
Yes, I know
I know
The clouds must clear

I know that the night must end
I know that the sun will rise
And I'll hear your voice deep inside

I know that the night must end
And that the clouds must clear
The sun
The sun will rise
The sun
The sun will rise

I can see what's happening	What?
And they don't have a clue	Who?
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line
Our trio's down to two.	Oh.

The sweet caress of twilight
There's magic everywhere
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air

Can you feel the love tonight
The peace the evening brings
The world for once in perfect harmony
With all its living things

So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past, impossible
She'd turn away from me

He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is?
The king I see inside?

Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are

And if he feels the love tonight
In the way I do

It's enough for this restless wanderer

Just to be with you
