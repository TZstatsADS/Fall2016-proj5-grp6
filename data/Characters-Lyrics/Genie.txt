Oh I come from a land, from a faraway place
Where the caravan camels roam
Where they cut off your ear
If they don't like your face
It's barbaric, but hey, it's home }
When the wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west
And the sand in the glass is right
Come on down
Stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly
To another Arabian night
Arabian nights
Like Arabian days
More often than not
Are hotter than hot
In a lot of good ways
Arabian nights
'Neath Arabian moons
A fool off his guard
Could fall and fall hard
Out there on the dunes
As a Teeny Genie Blue
I would dare to dream
I'd be given freedom free and clear
So forgive me if I sing
Or make a whole big thing
But I just can't maintain my cool veneer
You don't mind if I squeal do you?
Oooooh! I can't believe this is actually happening!
Well
I'll free you in one second,
I wanna sing this one little verse:
That I owe you
That you owe me
Means we're Ollie Ollie Oxen Free!
Say ain't it great to know that somebody's got your back!
I always knew that I could trust you kid
I knew you'd see that fair is fair
No, after you
Sure I'll take it
