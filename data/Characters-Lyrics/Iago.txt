Happy place!
You just don't know how swell you are!
There's just an itty bitty hitch
Embarrassing? Too true!
Let's all rejoice the spooky voice and
You're the diamond in the rough!
Three cheers, the diamond in the
Talk about the girl
It's just a cave that might eat you alive
No need to fear it!
Cue the Cave of Wonders!
Please try you diamond in the
