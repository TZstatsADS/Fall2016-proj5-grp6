Sometimes I'm right
Sometimes I'm wrong
But he doesn't care
He'll string along 
He loves me so
That funny honey of mine!

Sometimes I'm down
Sometimes I'm up
But he follows 'round
Like some droopy-eyed pup
He loves me so
That funny honey of mine!

He ain't no sheik
That's no great physique
Lord knows he ain't got the smarts

Oh, but look at that soul
I tell you, that whole
Is a whole lot greater
Than the sum of his parts

And if you knew him like me
I know you'd agree
What if the world
Slander my name?
Why, he'd be right there
Taking the blame

He loves me so
And it all suits me fine
That funny, sunny, honey
Hubby of mine!
He loves me so ...an angel!
That funny honey of mine!
He loves me so
That funny honey of mine!
Lord knows he ain't got the smarts


Now, he shot off his trap And I believed her!
That cheap little tramp. So, she
I can't stand that sap was two-timing me, huh?
Well, then, she can just
swing for all I care.
Look at him go Boy, I'm down at the garage,
Rattin' on me working my butt off fourteen
With just one more brain hours a day and she's up there
What half-wit he'd be munchin' on God-damn bon-bons
and jazzing. This time she
If they string me up pushed me too far.
I'll know who That little chiseler.
Brought the twine Boy, what a sap I was!

That scummy, crummy
Dummy hubby of mine

Mississippi

Very wealthy.

Six feet under.


But she was granted one more start


The convent of the sacred heart!


1920

Don't remember
I met Amos
And he stole my hear away
Convinced me to elope one day 

My ex-boy friend.

I was leavin'.

Like a madman!
Still I said, "Fred, move along."
She knew that she was doin' wrong


Then describe it


He came toward me.
From my bureau


Like a tiger


He had strength and she had none


And yet we both reached for the gun
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes we both
Oh yes, we both
Oh yes, we both reached for 
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun
Oh yes, we both reached for the gun
For the gun.


Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes they both
Oh yes, they both
Oh yes, they both reached for 
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun
Oh yes, they both reached for the gun
For the gun.


Understandable, understandable
Yes, it's perfectly understandable
Comprehensible, comprehensible
Not a bit reprehensible
It's so defensible!
Very frightened


Are you kidding?

All I'd say is
Though my choo-choo jumped my track
I'd give my life to bring him back

Stay away from

Jazz and liquor

And the man who

Play for fun

That's the thought that
Came upon me
When we both reached for the gun!
Billy and Mary Sunshine:
Yes, it's perfectly understandable
Comprehensible, comprehensible
Not a bit reprehensible
It's so defensible!
Let me Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes they both
Hear it! Oh yes, they both
Oh yes, they both reached for 
The gun, the gun, the gun, 
The gun
Oh yes, they both reached 
For the gun
A little louder! For the gun.
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes they both
Oh yes, they both
Oh yes, they both reached 
For the gun, the gun, 
Now you got it! The gun, the gun
Oh yes, they both reached 
For the gun
For the gun.

Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes they both
Oh yes, they both
Oh yes, they both reached for 
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun
Oh yes, they both reached for the gun.

Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes they both
Oh yes, they both
Oh yes, they both reached for 
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun,
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun,
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun,
The gun, the gun, the gun, the gun.

Both reached for the...gun
The name on everybody's lips
Is gonna be Roxie
The lady rakin' in the chips
Is gonna be Roxie

I'm gonna be a celebrity
That means somebody everyone knows
They're gonna recognize my eyes
My hair, my teeth, my boobs, my nose

From just some dumb mechanic's wife
I'm gonna be Roxie
Who says that murder's not an art?

And who in case she doesn't hang
Can say she started with a bang?
Foxy Roxie Hart!
ou wanna know something? I always wanted to be in vaudeville. 
And now that I'm a celebrity, I'm gonna have me a swell act, 
too. Yeah, I'll get a boy to work with - someone who can lift 
me up, show me off - Oh, hell, I'll get two boys. It'll frame 
me better. Think "Big," Roxie, think "Big." I'm gonna get me
a whole bunch of boys.

The name on everybody's lips
Is gonna be
The lady rakin' in the chips is gonna be 

That means somebody everyone knows

They're gonna recognize her eyes
Her hair, her teeth... 

...my boobs, my nose
Ooh, ah ah ah
From just some dumb mechanic's wife
I'm gonna be
Sing it!

Who says that murder's not an art?


And who in case she doesn't hang


Can say she started with a bang?



Think of those autographs I'll sign
"Good luck to you, Roxie"
And I'll appear in a lavaliere
That goes all the way down to my waist

But always the best of taste
Oooh, I'm a star.
And I love the audience. And the audience loves me for 
loving them. And I love the audience for loving me. And 
we just love each other. That's because none of us got 
enough love in our childhood.

And that's show biz, kid.

I'm gonna be 


And Sophie Tucker will shit, I know
To see her name get billed below

Foxy Roxie Hart

Oooh ah ah ah ah ah ah
(As boys exit)
Those are my boys.



One thing I know
And I've always known

I am my own
Best friend


Baby's alive
But baby's alone
And baby's her own
Best friend
Many's the guy
Who told me he cares
But they were scratchin' my back
'Cause I was scratchin' theirs

And trusting to luck
That's only for fools

I play in a game

Where I make the rules
And rule number one
From here to the end
Is 'I am my own best friend'

Three musketees
Who never say die
Are standing here this minute
Me
Myself
And I!
If life is a school
I'll pass every test
If life is a game
I'll play it the best
'Cause I won't give in
and I'll never bend
and I am my own best friend!
Me and my baby
My baby and me
We're 'bout as happy
As babies can be
What if I find
That I'm caught in a storm?
I don't care
My baby's there
And baby's bound to keep me warm
We're sticking together
And ain't we got fun
So much together
You'd count us as one
Tell old man, worry, to go climb a tree
'Cause I've got my baby
My sweet little baby
Look at my baby and me
Looka my baby
My baby and me
A dream of a duo
Now, don't you agree?
Why keep it mum
When there's nothing to hide?
And what I feel
I must reveal
Is more than I can keep inside
Let me assure you
It won't go away
I can assure you
It grows every day
I was a one once
But now I'm a "we"
'Cause I got my baby
My dear little baby
Look at my baby and me
Looka my baby
My baby and me
Facing the world 
Optimistically
Nothing can stop us
So nobody try
'Cause baby's rough
And full of stuff
And incidentally, so am I!
(Baby dance break.)
Get out of our way, folks
And give us some room
Watch how we bubble
And blossom and bloom
Life was a prison
But we got the key
Me and my baby
My dear little baby
My cute little baby 
My sweet little baby
My fat little baby
My soft little baby
My pink little baby 
My bald little baby
Looka, my baby and me

...gone, it's all gone.

It's good, isn't it?
Grand, isn't it?
Great, isn't it?
Swell, isn't it?
Fun, isn't it?
Nowadays

There's man, everywhere
Jazz, everywhere
Booze, everywhere
Life, everywhere
Joy, everywhere
Nowadays

You can like the life you're living
You can live the life you like
You can even marry Harry
But mess around with Ike
And that's

Good, isn't it?
Grand, isn't it?
Great, isn't it?
Swell, isn't it?
Fun, isn't it...
You can like the life you're living
You can live the life you like
You can even marry Harry
But mess around with Ike
And that's
Good, isn't it?
Grand, isn't it?
Great, isn't it?
Swell, isn't it?
Fun, isn't it?
But nothing stays

In fifty years or so
It's gonna change, you know
But, oh, it's heaven
Nowadays

And that's
