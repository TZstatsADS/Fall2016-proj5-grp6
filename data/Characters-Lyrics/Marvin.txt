I'm Jewish.
I'm Marvin.
We are manipulating people and we need to know
Our worst sides aren't ignored
We smell in bed.
Who stole the bed?
I'm nauseous
Well, the situation's this
Its not tough to comprehend
I divorced my wife
I left my child
And I ran off with a friend

But I want a tight-knit family
I want a group that harmonizes
I want my wife and kid and friend
To pretend
Time will mend
Our pain

So I make them interact
So I don't go by the book
We all eat as one-
Wife, friend, and son-
And I sing out as I cook

I want a tight-knit family.
I hope you all enjoy linguine.
Talk till you hear the dinner bell.
Such a dear clientele.

I swear we're gonna come through it.
I fear we'll probably fight,
But nothing's impossible.
Live by your wit-?
Kid, wife, and lover will have to admit
I was right
I cushioned the fall
I want it all
I want it all
I want it?


Syphilis

Maybe, darling, so do you
Hepatitis
Will you be my valentine?


Love is crazy/ Love-
Love is often boring
Love stinks/ Love-
Love is pretty often debris
When you find/ Love-
What you find
Then never, never, never, never, never/ Love-
Do it over again

Love reads like a bad biography/ Love-
All the names are changed to protect the innocent/ Love-
Whizzer begs
Shave your legs
You're a prick
Uh' ten months
Ten Months
Ten months
We are the salt of the bourgeoisie
I bring home the bacon
Don't
Isn't that a French lapel?
Send me flowers
Make them roses
See how quickly he sours
Pick up your clothes, Marvin breeding shows Marvin
I was rich
He was horny
Close your eyes, Whizzer
And we're not denying?
Whizzer drinks too much to see
What a joy is chastity
What a joy is saving his joys
For one man
Love me
Want me
No one's so cruel and cheap
What you love you devour? What I covet I keep

Isn't that right, Whizzer?
Let's both fight, Whizzer!
I'm best when I cheat
So I'll cheat, Whizzer, and I'll shove
And I'll kill for that thrill of first love
Ten months
We've been together for ten months
Ten months
In fact we've almost survived a year
Passion dies
I would kill for that thrill
Of first love- I would kill for that thrill
I would kill for that thrill of first

ason, please see a psychiatrist.
He's just a psychiatrist.
I'll pay the bill until you're old.


Ah, hey, kid, listen-


Speak with whom'
With Whizzer'
Oh my god.
He'll go.

Life can be wonderful
Isn't this wonderful?
And this had better come to a stop, Whizzer
Now, Whizzer, ciao Whizzer, bend
This had better come to an end
Brains
I'm not that rich, but, hell, I'm smart
Love me
Love me, please, or break my heart
This is all very neat. This is all very neat.

This is all very smart
This had better come to a stop, Mendel
Don't touch me, don't condescend
This had better come
This had better come to a
This, this, this, this
This had better come to an end
Late for dinner, late again
Late for dinner, late again
Late for dinner, late again
Late for dinner, late again
This is incredibly boring
This had better come to an end
Why is he always here?

March

Marvin's always wary
March

That's the king
Treat him nice
Use some brains
Please protect him
Play the game
Have a little scotch
Do you want my help?
Start again, we've seen the worst
Move a pawn
Move

Move a pawn
Not the queen
Jesus
Move a pawn
Good first move
Thank you kindly
God, you're pretty
What?
He isn't very bright
He's learning-
He's learning how to speak the language
Move

This game shits
Yes sir
Sure!
Wait
Wait
Wait
Watch the queen
And money
And money
And money
And money
Anyone understand?
All I want's a kiss
Anyone understand?



Hello, Trina, thank you for coming here
Goodness, Trina, I am relieved
Frankly, Trina, nice of you coming here
Thank you, Trina, I have received
Your new-sent wedding invitations!
They are
You say you'll

You die on
Tell me, Trina, what was the impetus?
Sorry, Trina, look in my eyes
Really, Trina, this is ridiculous
Jesus, Trina, how I despise
Your need for stupid conversation!


You are


I'm sure you

How could you
I am so dumb
Dumb!



I never wanted to love you.
I only wanted to see my face in yours.
Jason smiled, save this child.
How he adores, and hates me-

It really killed me when you took those vows.
Don't misunderstand, I'm in command!
Anyhow, we're through!
I never wanted,
I wanted-
I never, never, never, never,
Never, never wanted to love you!
I never wanted to love you!
I never wanted to love you!
I never wanted to love you!



Kid, be my son.
What I've done to you is rotten.
Say I was scared.
I kept marching in one place,
Marching in time
To a tune I'd forgotten.

I loved you, I love you.
I meant no disgrace.
This here is love,
When we're talking
Face to face.

Father to son,
I, for one, would take love slower.
I've made my choice,
But you can sing a different song.
Watch as you sing,
How your voice gets much lower.

You'll be, kid, a man, kid,
If nothing goes wrong.
Sing for yourself
As we march
Along.

A man, kid, you'll be, kid,
Whatever the song.
Sing for yourself
As we march
Along.
Have you chosen yet who?ll cater?
I know a person who can cater.
Can we consider who's gonna cater?
Please?
Please?

My child?
Isn't he annoying?
Isn't he too much?
Jesus, he's annoying! Jason, where's my hug?



You are gonna kill your mother.
Don't feel guilty, kill your mother.
Rather than humiliate her,
Killing your mother is the merciful thing to do.
Go ahead and kill your mother.

It's been hot,
Also very sweet.
And I'm not usually indiscreet.
But when he sparkles,
The earth begins to sway.
What more can I say?
How can I express
How confused am I by our happiness?
I can't eat breakfast,
I cannot tie my shoe.
What more can I do?

If I said I love him,
You might think my words come cheap.
Let's just say
I'm glad he's mine awake,
Asleep.

It's been hot
Also it's been swell.
More than not,
It's been more than words can tell.
I halt.
I stammer.
I sing a rondelay.
What more can I say?

I'll stay calm.
Untie my tongue.
And try to stay
Both kind and young.

I was taught
Never brag or shout.
Still it's hot,
Just like how you read about.
And also funny,
And never too uncouth.
That's the simple truth.
Can you tell
I have been revised?
It's so swell,
Damn it, even I'm surprised.
We laugh,
We fumble
We take it day by day.
What more can I say?



No, it didn't.
Just begin.
Let me live, please forgive
Me for winning one game.
I attack!
I hit!
My game! 1 2 3 4!
1 2 3 4.
Don't be bitter.
It's unreal, you're a quitter!
Be a jerk, my sweet bruiser.
Try to be a decent loser! At least you could give me that!
Do you know all I want is you'
Anything you do is alright. Yes, it's alright.


Who'd believe that we two
Would end up as lovers?
Him and me, you and I
Passionately lovers
Right
Don't fight
Just stop it
Geez
Louise
I'm staying here in this spot
Whether you want me to or not
I'm staying
Here I am, by your side
One old horny lover
What's the fuss? I'm not scared
What good is a lover who's scared?
Hit me if you need to
Slap my face or hold me till winter
Oh, baby, please do
I love you too
My lover
Shut your mouth, go to sleep
Time I met a sailor
Are you sleeping yet or...?
What is what? Whizzer, but
I can't help but feeling I've failed
Let's be scared together
Let's pretend that nothing is awful
There's nothing to fear'
Look at us, four old friends
Four unlikely lovers
I have too
I love the sky!
I love bad weather!
There's nothing to fear
I love you. I love you

What would I do
If I had not met you?
Who would I blame my life on?
Once I was told
That all men get what they deserve.
Who the hell then threw this curve?
There are no answers.
But who would I be
If you had not been my friend?

You're the only one,
One out of a thousand others,
Only one my child would allow.
When I'm having fun,
You're the one I wanna talk to.
Where have you been?
Where are you now?

What would I do
If I had not loved you?
How would I know what love is?
God only knows, too soon
I'll remember your faults.
Meanwhile, though, it's tears and schmaltz.

There are no answers.
But what would I do
If you had not been my friend?
I left my kid and left my wife
To be with you,
To be insulted by such handsome men.
I'd do it again.
I'd like to believe that I'd do it again
And again and again...
And
What more can I say?
How am I to face tomorrow?
Yes, I'd beg or steal or borrow
If I could hold you for
One hour more.
One hour more.
What would I do
If I had not seen you?
Were just gonna skip that stage.

There are no answers.
But what would I do
If you hadn't been my friend?
No simple answers.
But what would I do
If you had not been
My friend. My friend. My friend.
