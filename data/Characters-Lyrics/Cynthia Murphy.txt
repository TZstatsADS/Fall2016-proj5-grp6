Another masterful attempt ends with disaster
Pour another cup of coffee
Watch it all crash and burn
It's a puzzle
It's a maze
I've tried to steer through it a million ways
But, each day is another wrong turn
Is there a class that I can take to learn your language?
'Cause I am trying to get with it
I use Google as a verb
Somebody come to the rescue before I'm too far gone
I'm flying blind (I'm flying blind)
I'm flying blind (I'm flying blind)
Come sit with me
Cynthia
For five minutes?
You know Larry, at some point you're going to have to start-
I hear your voice, feel you near
Within these words I finally find you
And now that I know that you are still here
I will sing no requiem tonight
I will sing no requiem
