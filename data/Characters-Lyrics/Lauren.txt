Oh, no. You don't dare. Girl, girl, girl. I'm warning you! No! 
I think I have a crush. I can't. I think I'm falling for him.

Oh, no.
Why not?

Women have been making bad choices
Since the beginning of time.
Are you gonna be another one of mine? Ohh

Used to think you were from outer space
Who's that bright-eyed guy in your place?
You're kind of cute
When you're not so shy.
Oh.

But I've been here before
Have I come back for more?
Another chapter in the history of wrong guys
You used to be so "eh"
A limp lackluster bore
But now you re changing into
Something I just can't ignore.

Charlie, honestly
I`ve been hurt like this before
Is there really more to you
Then I always thought?
How can you surprise me anymore?
Oh. Oh. Oh.

He's got a girlfriend, you flake. 
Why are they only nice when they are unavailable?

Don't want to be another star-crosses lover.
We all know how that ends.
I'm better off without him
We're better off as friends.
But I've been here before
Have I come back for more?

Another chapter in the history of wrong guys.
Yesterday no spark
No heart aching allure
But today I'm feeling
Something I just can't ignore.

Charlie, honestly
Iv'e been hurt like this before
Oh. Oh. Oh.

The history of wrong guys:
Chapter one - he's a bum
Two - he's not into you
Three - he's a sleaze
Four- loves the girl next door
Five- loves the boy next door
Six - don't love you no more
-makes you insecure
-makes you so unsure
-is so immature
-loves his mother more
-or...
... has a girlfriend named Nicola

Charlie, honestly
I've been hurt like this before
I can see there's more to you
Than what I always thought
But I won't be burned anymore
Oh, oh, oh
I been exec-utized.
