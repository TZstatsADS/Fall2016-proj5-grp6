Doesn't help to know you're so far away, Traveling around sure gets me down and lonely, Nothing else to do but close my mind, I sure hope the road don't come to own me, There's so many dreams I've yet to find, But you're so far away, Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore, It would be so fine to see your face at my door, Doesn't help to know you're so far away, What shall I write?, What can I

easy living here with you, You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do, Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool, And it's too late, baby, now it's too late, Though we really did try
