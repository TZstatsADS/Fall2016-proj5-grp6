Circle of Life       
            [RAFIKI]
From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done

There is far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high
Through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round

It's the circle of life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle 
The circle of life

[RAFIKI AND CHORUS]
It's the circle of life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle 
The circle of life

Morning Report       
            [ZAZU]
It's an honor and a privilege, a duty I perform
With due sense of decorum and with pride
With deference and great respect very much the norm
Plus a hint of sycophancy on the side
To lay before my ruler all the facts about his realm
To fill him in on all the beastly news

[MUFASA]
[spoken] Yes, yes, Zazu, get on with it!

[ZAZU]
In order that His Majesty stands sturdy at the helm
Aware of all the fauna's latest views

[MUFASA]
[spoken] Zazu! The morning report!

[ZAZU]
[spoken] Er - yes, Sire - the morning report 

Chimps are going ape, firaffes remain above it all
Elephants remember, though just what I can't recall
Crocodiles are snapping up fresh offers from the banks
Showed interes in my nest egg but I quickly said, "No thanks!"
We haven't paid the hornbills and the vultures have a hunch
Not everyone invited (sung) will be coming back from lunch
This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar and snort
Not a tale I distort
On the morning report

[MUFASA]
[spoken] What are you doing, son?

[YOUNG SIMBA]
[spoken] Pouncing

[MUFASA]
[spoken] Let an old pro show you how it's done 

[ZAZU]
[spoken] The buffalo have got a beef
About this season's grass
Warthogs have been thwarted
In attempts to save their gas
Flamingoes in the pink 
Chasing secretary birds
Saffron is theis season's color
Seen in all the herds
Moving down the rank and file
To near the bottom rung
Far too many beetles are

[sung] Quite frankly in the dung
Aaaaaaaaak! 

[MUFASA]

Stay low to the ground
Shh, not a sound 
Take it slow
One more step
Then pounce!

[YOUNG SIMBA]
Yeah, stay low! 

This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar and snort
Not a tale I distort
On the morning report

[MUFASA AND ZAZU AND YOUNG SIMBA]
This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar and snort
Not a tale I distort
On the morning report

I Just Can't Wait to Be King       
            [YOUNG SIMBA]
I'm gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware!

[ZAZU]
[spoken] Well I've never seen a king of beasts 
With quite so little hair

[YOUNG SIMBA]
I'm gonna be the mane event
Like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my roar

[ZAZU]
[spoken] Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing

[YOUNG SIMBA]
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

[YOUNG SIMBA]
No one saying do this

[YOUNG NALA]
No one saying be there

[YOUNG SIMBA]
No one saying stop that

[YOUNG NALA  AND YOUNG SIMBA]
No one saying see here
Free to run around all day

[ZAZU]
[spoken] Now when I said that --

What I meant was --

What you don't realize -- 

Now see here!
That's definitely out!

[YOUNG SIMBA]
Free to do it all my way

[ZAZU]
[spoken] I think it's time that you and I arranged a heart-to-heart

[YOUNG NALA]
Kings don't need advice 
From little hornbills for a start

[ZAZU]
[spoken] If this is where the monarchy is headed
Count me out
Out of service, out of Africa
I wouldn't hang about
This child is getting wildly out of [sung] wing

[YOUNG SIMBA]
Oh, I just can't wait to be king
Everybody look left

[YOUNG NALA]
Everybody look right

[YOUNG SIMBA]
Everywhere you look I'm

[YOUNG NALA AND YOUNG SIMBA]
Standing in the spotlight

[ZAZU]
[spoken] Not yet!

[YOUNG NALA, YOUNG SIMBA AND CHORUS]
Let every creature go for broke and sing
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling

[YOUNG SIMBA]
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

[YOUNG NALA]
Oh, he just can't wait to be king!

[YOUNG SIMBA]
Oh, I just can't wait...

[YOUNG NALA]
Just can't wait...

[YOUNG SIMBA AND YOUNG NALA]
To be king!

[BANZAI]

I think we should begin the meal from scratch
So many juicy segments to detatch
Be good as gold for you're as good as carved

Be Prepared       
            [SCAR]
[spoken] I never thought hyenas essential
They're crude and unspeakably plain
But maybe they've a glimmer of potential
If allied to my vision and brain.

[sung] I know that your powers of retention
Are as wet as a warthog's backside
But thick as you are, pay attention
My words are a matter of pride

It's clear from your vacant expressions
The lights are not all on upstairs
But we're talking kings and successions
Even you can't be caught unawares

So prepare for a chance of a lifetime
Be prepared for sensational news
A shining new era 
Is tiptoeing nearer

[SHENZI]
And where do we feature?

[SCAR]
Just listen to teacher
I know it sounds sordid
But you'll be rewarded
When at last I am given my dues!
And injustice deliciously squared
Be prepared!

[BANZAI]
[spoken] Yeah! Be prepared. 
We'll be prepared. For what?

[SCAR]
[spoken] For the death of the king!

[BANZAI]
[spoken] Is he sick?

[SCAR]
[spoken] No, fool! We're going to kill him... and Simba too!

[SHENZI]
[spoken] Great idea! Who needs a king?

[BANZAI AND SHENZI]
[spoken] No king, No king, nah nah nah nah nah nah!

[SCAR]
[spoken] Idiots!  There will be a king!

[BANZAI]
[spoken] But you said...

[SCAR]
[spoken] I will be king! 
Stick with me, and you'll never be hungry again!

[BANZAI AND SHENZI]
[spoken] Yay, all right!  
Long live the king!  
Long live the king!

[HYENAS]
[sung] It's great that we'll soon be connected
With a king who'll be all-time adored

[SCAR]
Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected
To take certain duties on board
The future is littered with prizes
And though I'm the main addressee
The point that I must emphasize is
You won't get a sniff without me

[HYENAS]
So prepare for the coup of the century

[SCAR]

Be prepared for the murkiest scam
Meticulous planning
Tenacity spanning
Decades of denial
Is simply why I'll
Be king undisputed
Respected, saluted
And seen for the wonder I am

[HYENAS]
Ooooh!
We'll have food!
Lots of food
We repeat
Endless meat

[SCAR]
Yes my teeth and ambitions are bared

[SCAR AND HYENAS]
Be prepared!
Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared!

Madness of King Scar       
            Zazu, why am I not loved?
I am that rare and awesome thing
I'm every inch a king
Yet I feel a twinge of doubt
As I go walk about

Hey, boss!

When my name is whispered through the pride
Is this talk of love or regicide?

Reggie who?

Tell me I'm adored
Please tell me I'm adored

Hey, boss!

Oh, what is it?

We got a bone to pick with you

There's no food, no water--

Yeah. It's dinnertime, and there ain't no
stinkin' entrees!

Oh, you and your petty complaints. You don't know what real hunger is. 
Day after day it gnaws at the very core of my being

I had that once. It was worms

No, no, no... it's like an itch... deep, persistent, profound...

That's it-- worms! When they get really bad all you gotta do is... hunker
down and scoot

Thanks for the tip. Ingrates! If it weren't for me you'd be beating off
buzzards for your next bite! 

Yeah, you're our savior, thanks a bunch
But how about some lunch?
It doesn't matter if it's fresh
I need a fix of flesh
My bones have moved to where they've never been
They are on the outside looking in

Are you blaming me?

Oh no, it's the lionesses

You are so adored
Oh, you are so adored

That's more like it

But what I'd give for one more hit
Of wildebeest kielbasa
Or maybe hornbill on the spit...

Oh, how I miss Mufasa

Mufasa?! Mufasa?! How dare you! I told you never to mention that name! 

Note taken. I shall never mention "M-m-m" again

Even in death, his shadow looms over me
There he is!
No! There he is!
And there!

Calm yourself, Sire, or you'll get another one of your splitting
headaches! 

I am perfectly fine!
I'm better than Mufasa was
I'm revered
I am reviled
I'm idolized
I am despised
I'm keeping calm
I'm going wild!

I tell myself I'm fine
Yes I am, no you're not
Yes I am, no you're not
I tell myself I'm fine

No you're not, yes I am, no you're not
Yes I am
No you're not
Yes, no, yes, no, who am I talking to...?

Oh, pull yourself together, Sire!

Oh, very well. Zazu? Zazu, Zazu, Zazu...?

Yes, Sire?

Nobody loved me, there's the rub, not even as a cub
What did my brother have that I don't have?

Do you want the short list or the long?

Whatever!

Well, he had adoring subjects... a loving family... a devoted queen... 

That's it! I need a queen!

A what?

A queen, man! A queen! Without a queen, what am I? A dead end, no line, no
descendants, no future. With a queen, I'll have cubs... Immortality will
be mine! Immortality will be mine!

Scar

Ah, Nala... Your timing couldn't have been more perfect. My how you've
grown

Scar, you have got to do something. We're being forced to overhunt

She's got those assets feminine

You're the king. Control the hyenas

I have to make her mine

You're destroying the Pridelands

Nobility in every gene

If we don't stop now.. Don't you see...

She has to be my queen

...there's still a chance for things to be all right again... 

Come, sweet Nala
It's written in the stars

What are you doing? Are you listening to me?

We'll create a host of little Scars

What are you talking about?

Tell me I'm adored

Get away from me

Tell me I'm adored
Oh, Nala... you know how I loathe violence... One way or another, you will
be mine

Never, Scar. Never!

You belong to me
You all belong to me

Endless Night       
            Where has the starlight gone?
Dark is the day
How can I find my way home?

Home is an empty dream
Lost to the night
Father, I feel so alone

You promised you'd be there
Whenever I needed you
Whenever I call your name
You're not anywhere

I'm trying to hold on
Just waiting to hear your voice
One word, just a word will do
To end this nightmare

When will the dawning break
Oh endless night
Sleepless I dream of the day

When you were by my side
Guiding my path
Father, I can't find the way

You promised you'd be there
Whenever I needed you
Whenever I call your name
You're not anywhere

I'm trying to hold on
Just waiting to hear your voice
One word, just a word will do
To end this nightmare

I know that the night must end
And that the sun will rise
And that the sun will rise

I know that the clouds must clear
And that the sun will shine
And that the sun will shine

I know that the night must end
And that the sun will rise
And that the sun will rise
I know that the clouds must clear
And that the sun will shine
And that the sun will shine

Yes, I know

            I can see what's happening			What?
And they don't have a clue			Who?
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line
Our trio's down to two.				Oh.

The sweet caress of twilight
There's magic everywhere
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air

Can you feel the love tonight
The peace the evening brings
The world for once in perfect harmony
With all its living things

So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past, impossible
She'd turn away from me

He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is?
The king I see inside?

Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are

And if he feels the love tonight
In the way I do

It's enough for this restless wanderer

Just to be with you

He Lives in You (Reprise)       
            Ingonyama nengw' enamabala

Night and the spirit of life calling mamela
And a voice just the fear of a child answers mamela

Ubu khosi bo khokho		[This is the throne of our ancestors]

We ndodana ye sizwe sonke	[Oh, son of the nation)]

Wait, there's no mountain too great
Hear the words and have faith
Have faith

He lives in you
He lives in me

He watches over
Everything we see
Into the water
Into the truth
In your reflection
He lives in you

He lives in you
He lives in me
He watches over
Everything we see
Into the water
Into the truth
In your reflection
He lives in you

He lives in you
He lives in you
He lives in you
He lives in you

He lives in you

He lives in me

He watches over
Everything we see
Into the water
Into the truth
In your reflection
He lives in you

He lives in you
He lives in me
He watches over
Everything we see
Into the water
Into the truth
In your reflection
He lives in you
