Welcome to the Renaissance       
            Lyrics:
War of the roses chaucerâs tales
The brutal feudal system
Holy crusades
Bubonic plague
Canât say that weâve really missed them

So dark and barbaric,
So dull and mundane
That was so middle ages
That was so charlemagne

Welcome to the renaissance
With poets, painters and bon vivants
And merry minstrels, who
Stroll the streets of london
A-strumming their lutes
And puffy pants and pointy leather boots

Welcome to the renaissance
Where we ooh and aah here
With ambiance
Weâre so progressive
The latest and the greatest
We bring it to you
With much ado
Welcome to the renaissance
Where everything is new

Here weâve made advances in the sciences
We have the latest gadgets and appliances
Our mugs are made of pewter
Our houses all are tudor
Decorated with a modern flair

See us in our petticoats and farthingales
Our trendy beards we trim to look like swallow tails

Weâre called elizabethans
Theyâre all a bunch of heathens
Heathens heading straight for you-know-where

While witches are burning and wars tend to start
We bring you moments of culture and art
(culture and art)

Welcome to the renaissance
Where our printing press has the fancy fonts
Thatâs right weâre fancy
And very literary
Theatrical too
Itâs what we do
Welcome to the renaissance
Where everything is new

Hey look itâs francis bacon with a chicken
Whatâs he makinâ?
Well i think heâs found a way of freezing meat
Thatâs new

Hey look itâs walter raleigh
Found a new world, by golly,
And heâs brought us all tobacco, what a treat
Also new

And we have a list of writers who
Are always writing something new
Itâs true we do
Like who?
Like who?!

Like dekker
(whoo)
John webster
(whoo)
Ben jonson
(uh huh)
And christopher marlowe

Thomas kyd
Thomas middleton
Thomas more

And our brightest star yo
Heâs the bomb
The soul of the age
The wiz of the elizabethan stage
Heâs incredible
Unforgettable
Heâs just so freakinâ awesome
Shakespeare
Shakespeare

We love him (x8)

His brains are so brilliant
His writingâs first rate
His actingâs is incredible
Isnât he great

We love him (x4)
(isnât he great)
We love him (x2)
We love him

Welcome to the renaissance
Not the one in italy or in france
No one in england
The one where william shakespeare
Is cream of the crop
The one where william shakespeare is the top

Welcome to the renaissance
The 16th century experience
The age thatâs golden
The olden days are over
We bid them adieu
Well hallelu-

Welcome to the renaissance
Where everything is new
Where everything is new
Welcome to the renaissance
Where everything is new

God, I Hate Shakespeare       
            NICK: God, I hate Shakespeare!
Thatâs right, I said it!
NIGEL: No!
NICK: I do! I hate Shakespeare!
NIGEL: Why?
NICK: I just donât get it
How a mediocre actor from a measly little town
Is suddenly the brightest jewel in Englandâs royal crown
Oh God I hate Shakespeare
His plays are wordy but OH NO!
The âgreatâ Shakespeare!
That little turd
He has no sense about the audience he makes them feel so dumb
The bastard doesnât care that my poor ass is getting numb
THE TROUPE: How can you say that?
How can you say that?
NICK: Itâs easy, I can say it cause itâs absolutely true!
THE TROUPE: Donât be a penis, the man is a genius!
NICK: His genius is heâs fooling all of you!
NIGEL: But heâs brilliant
What majesty flows from his pen
His poetry soars like a sweet violin
Godâs own inspiration like lightning doth strike him
And he captures my soul!
NICK (speaking): Jeez, you sound just like him!
NIGEL (speaking): Really? Thanksâ¦
NICK: You should hate Shakespeare!
NIGEL: Well no I donât, I try to emulate Shakespeare!
NICK: Well thereâs your problem! Youâre so blinded by âThe Bardâ whoâs such a pompous little man
NIGEL: Why is it a problem to admit that Iâm a fan?
NICK: Cause heâs a hack
With a knack
For stealing anything he can
THE TROUPE: How can you say that?
How can you say that?
The man really knows how to write a bitchinâ play!
You wish you could pen one
We wish we were in one
NICK: I just wish that he would go away!
NIGEL (speaking): Well thatâs not gonna happen, 
because everyone I know says that heâs the greatest writer that Englandâs ever known!
NICK: And thatâs ANOTHER thing I hate about Shakespeare!
Is all the twits who bloviate about Shakespeare!
And how they prattle on about his great accomplishments, well la-di-da-di-dah!
And once they start their gushing thereâs no stopping them
And then itâs âblah blah blah blah blah Shakespeare!â
And he walks in, itâs âdum da dum ta da Shakespeare!â
Heâs holding court and they say âWill youâre such a genius and your writing is divine,
A rose by any other name is such a clever line!â
And theyâre all âooh!â and heâs all âstopâ and theyâre all âyayâ and Iâm all âughâ
And Iâm REALLY getting sick of it!
And oh, oh, oh, oh, I HATE SHAKESPEARE!
THE TROUPE: I think by now we sort of know you hate Shakespeare!
NICK: Shmakespeare!
The way he feigns humility when all he does is gloat
The way he wears that silly frilly collar âround his throat
The poster child for why no one should ever procreate
Let me make a shorter list so I can give it to you straight:
Every little thing about Shakespeare
Is what I hate!
THE TROUPE (overlapping): He hates! He hates! He clearly surely really truly hates Shakespeare!
NIGEL (speaking): Donât hate!

God, I Hate Shakespeare (Reprise)       
            Nick:
God, I hate Shakespeare
But when I sit and really contemplate Shakespeare
I guess I hate the fact that he is everything I ever dreamed that I could be
I mostly hate the way he makes me feel about me
Cause the truth is

It wouldn't be that bad to be Shakespeare
In fact, I'd give my left gnad to be Shakespeare
If I could only have one tiny little smidgen of his notoriety
It would relieve me of these pressures of responsibility

I've gotta make it happen
Gotta find that pot of gold
If there was just some way to know just what the future holds
(Spoken) What the future holds!

A Musical       
            Nick (Spoken): What the hell are musicals?

Nostradamus (Spoken):
It appears to be a play where the dialogue stops
And the plot is conveyed through song

Nick (Spoken): Through song?

Nostradamus: Yes.

Nick: Wait, so an actor is saying his lines and out of nowhere he just starts singing?

Nostradamus: Yes.

Nick:
Well that is the
(Singing) Stupidest thing that I have ever heard
You're doing a play, got something to say
So you sing it?
It's absurd
Who on earth is going to sit there while an actor breaks into song
And what possible thought could the audience think
Other than "This is horribly wrong"

Nostradamus (Spoken): Remarkably? They won't think that

Nick (Spoken:) Seriously? Why not?

Nostradamus:
Because it's a musical
A musical
And nothing's as amazing as a musical
With song and dance
And sweet romance
And happy endings happening by happenstance
Bright lights, stage fights, and a dazzling chorus
You wanna be great?
Then you gotta create a musical

Nick (Spoken):
I don't know
I find it hard to believe that people would actually pay to see something like this

Nostradamus:
Let's just say it's a Saturday night
And you wanna go out on the town
Got a lady to flatter who might give it up if you don't let her down
You could go see a tragedy
That wouldn't be very fun
Or a play from Greek mythology
See a mother have sex with her son, euggh
You could see a drama
With all of the trauma and pain
Or you could see something more relaxing and less taxing on the brain

You could go see a musical
A musical
A puppy piece, releasing all your blues-ical
Where crude is cool (Ahhh)
A catchy tune
And limber-legged ladies thrill you 'til you swoon
Oohs, ahhs, big applause, and a standing ovation

Nostradamus & Ensemble:
The future is bright
If you could just write a musical

Nostradamus:
Some make you happy
Some make you sad
Some are quite big
Some quite small
Some are too long
Some are just plays with song
Some musicals have no talking at all

Nick (Spoken): No talking at all

Nostradamus:
That's right
There's no talking
All of the dialogue is song
In a very dramatic fashion

Nick (Spoken): Um, really?

Nostradamus: Yes, really

Nick (Spoken): There's no talking

Nostradamus:
There's no talking
And they often stay on one note for a very long time
So when they change to a different note, you notice
And it's supposed to create a dramatic effect
But mostly you just sit there asking yourself
"Why aren't they talking?"

Nick (Spoken): That sounds miserable

Nostradamus: I believe it's pronounced MisÃ©rable

Nick (Spoken): And people actually like this?

Nostradamus:
(Spoken) No, they love it, and what's not to love!
It's such a delight
There's nothing quite like a musical

(Spoken) Another vision! I haven't even told you the best part yet!
Feel that fascinating rhythm moving to your feet
Whoa, whoa (Um, what is that)
Feel your ass gyrating to that titillating beat (Are you okay?)
You slap your lap
And finger snap
That's when you know it's time to tap
Oh

Nick (Spoken): What the hell are you doing now?

Nostradamus (Spoken):
It's called a dance break
Apparently this happens in musicals as well
People on stage just burst into spontaneous dance

Nick (Spoken):
Why?
Does it advance the plot? (No)
Advance character? (Not necessarily)
Then why do it?

Nostradamus (Spoken): Because it's entertaining! 5, 6, 7, 8

Another vision!
It's a musical
Whaddya talk, whaddya talk
It's a musical!
A Suessical?
No, a musical with girls on stage

Ensemble: A musical

Nostradamus:
We've got snappy repartees
And the women are risquÃ©
And the chorus boys are kind of gay

Ensemble: A musical

Nostradmaus: A true, blue, new

Nostradamus & Ensemble: Musical

Nostradamus (Spoken):
Stand back, it's a musical!
Some musicals are very serious

Nostradamus & Ensemble:
A big, glittering musical
A musical
It's a musical for us!

Nostradamus:
A big and shiny,
Mighty fine-y, glitter, glitz, and chorus line-y
Bob your head and shake your hiney
Musical
It's a musical (It's a musical)
It is a musical (It's a musical)

Nick:
(Spoken) Yes! I get it now!
We'll do a musical (No kidding)
A musical
What could be more amazing than a musical
With song and dance
And sweet romance
And with a musical we might have half a chance

Nostradamus & Nick:
Oohs, ahhs, big applause with everyone cheering for us

Nostradamus:
And for some unexplainable reason
The crowd goes wild every time
When dancers kick in unison in one big wonderful line

All:
And then you got yourself a musical
A musical
A la, la, la, la, la, la, la palooza-sical
With splashy style and a big fake smile
A snazzy pants, some jazzy hands, I swear that I'll
Cross my heart, hope to die if it isn't a doozy

Nostradamus:
Take it from me
They'll be flocking to see

Nostradamus & Nick:
Your star lit
Won't quit
Big hit
Musical

All: A big hit musical

I Love the Way       
            PORTIA:
I love Sydney, and Marlow,
And often I borrow their words to express how I feel.
I love poems of mystery,
Fantasy, history, oh what seductive appeal.
At night, alone in my bedroom,
Satisfying my need.
The candlelight fire ignites my desire,
To read
Oh, every time I hear a perfect rhyme I get all tingly
Because I know,
That to find a perfect rhyme is not an easy, thingly.

I love places that words let me go
I love the way that your words move me so
No words have touched me the way that yours do
And I loveâ¦you are really doing something to me mister poetry man
Oh forgive me, I never get to discuss poems in this way

NIGEL BOTTOM:
Oh itâs okay,
I just never knew that poetry could affect someone the way it affects me

PORTIA:
Me neither

NIGEL BOTTOM:
Itâs the end all, the be all. Oh, you ought a see all the books that I have on my shelf

PORTIA:
Me too
I find pleasure perusing those writings and musing so often I pleasure myself
Wait, that didnât sound right

NIGEL BOTTOM:
No, I know what you mean
When Iâm deep in the throes of impassionate prose,
I could scream

PORTIA:
You scream?

NIGEL BOTTOM:
Yeah

PORTIA:
So do I! Ahh
Oh, I love a lilting line of lyrical alliteration.

NIGEL BOTTOM:
Who doesnât love alliteration?

PORTIA:
And then Iâm like well, when the phrases come together like a consummation

NIGEL BOTTOM:
Itâs sweet elation

BOTH:
I love the places that words let me go,
I love the way that your words move me so
I love, that you feel, the same way I do
And I love,
You know that I love,
You know that I love,

NIGEL BOTTOM (spoken):
Me too!

You can't be the best because I am the best
I have written 12 plays and each one is a testament to my great skill
I am the Will

And Titus Andronicus
And oh did I forget Romeo and Juliet

Nick:
Well I have just written the thing that the critics are calling the greatest thing they've ever seen
The people are loving it
Can't get enough of it
Everyone, even including the Queen
She recently invited me to her castle where she knighted me
And privately she told me that you're not any good, not any good, not any good, not any good
And she told me that all of your plays make her vomit
And none of them's as good as my musical Omelette

Will:
Wait a minute
You wrote Omelette

Nick:
Yes

Will:
I never thought that I would meet my equal
But I could see that I've been bested by the best
Maybe we could partner on a sequel

Nick:
Oh my, how the tide has turned
Let's review
What have we learned
See, you were here
But now we've swapped
So kiss this Bottom
I'm on the top

Hard to Be the Bard       
            SHAKESPEARE:
My days are so busy it's making me dizzy
There's so much I gotta do
There's lunches and meetings and poetry readings
and endless interviews
Gotta pose for a portrait
and how I deplore sitting there for eternity
Then it's off to the inn
Where my innkeeper friend
Wants to name a drink after me
Then it's back to my room, where I resume
My attempt to write a hit
Just me and my beer and the terrible fear
That I might be losing it

And it's hard,

MAN SERVANTS:
It's hard

SHAKESPEARE:
It's hard,

MAN SERVANTS:
It's hard

SHAKESPEARE:
It's really hard
So very very hard

MAN SERVANTS:
It's really hard
Very very hard

SHAKESPEARE:
I make it look easy but honey believe me
It's hard

MAN SERVANTS:
It's hard

SHAKESPEARE:
It's hard,

MAN SERVANTS:
It's hard

SHAKESPEARE:
It's so

SHAKESPEARE & MAN SERVANTS:
Incredibly hard
So inconceivably, unbelievably hard

SHAKESPEARE:
It's hard to be the bard

Honestly, I don't know how I do it. There's only so much of me to go around.

I've got so many fans
With so many demands
I can hardly go take a piss

MAN SERVANTS:
He can't pee

SHAKESPEARE:
Be it theater-freak or
The autograph-seeker
They all want a piece of this

MAN SERVANTS:
Gimme, Gimme

SHAKESPEARE:
It's a cross that I bear,
I'm like Jesus, I swear
It's a burden but I suffer through it

MAN SERVANTS:
He is suffering

SHAKESPEARE:
It's all part of the game,
The trappings of fame
But somebody's gotta do it

MAN SERVANTS:
So he does it

SHAKESPEARE:
And I know, I know, I gotta go
And get back to my pen and ink
Oh don't make me do it,
Don't make me go through it
Can somebody get me a drink!

'Cause it's hard

MAN SERVANTS:
It's hard

SHAKESPEARE:
It's hard,

MAN SERVANTS:
It's hard

SHAKESPEARE:
It's really really hard
It's sexy but it's hard

MAN SERVANTS:
It's really hard
Sexy but it's hard

SHAKESPEARE:
This bar that I'm
Raising to be this amazing!
It's hard,

MAN SERVANTS:
It's hard

SHAKESPEARE:
It's hard,

MAN SERVANTS:
It's hard

SHAKESPEARE:
It's so

SHAKESPEARE & MAN SERVANTS:
Annoyingly hard
So unavoidably, unenjoyably hard

SHAKESPEARE:
It's hard to be the bard, baby

I know writing made me famous, but being famous is just so much more fun. You see...

What people just don't understand
Is that writing's demanding
It's mentally challenging and it's a bore
It's such a chore
TO sit in a room by yourself

Oh my god, I just hate it!

And you're trying to find
An opening line or a brilliant idea
And you're pacing the floor
And hoping for just a bit of divine intervention
That one little nugget that one little spark
Then Eureka! You find it you're ready to start
So now you can write, right? Wrong!
You're not even close, you remember that damn it,
Your play's gotta be in iambic pentameter!
So you write down a word but it's not the right word,
So you try a new word but you hate the new word
And you need a good word but you can't find the word
Oh where is it, what is it, what is it, where is it!
Blah-blah-blah, ha ha, ah-ha -UGHHHHHHHH!

VALET:
Sir.

SHAKESPEARE:
Hello.

VALET:
You asked for information on what Nicholas Bottom is writing. Our spy is here with the news.

SHAKESPEARE:
Did he see me losing it?

VALET:
He's half blind, sir.

SHAKESPEARE:
Oh, good. Then he only saw half of it. You see what I did? Ha ha. Speak, man. What news?

EYEPATCH MAN:
I saw Nick Bottom, I did. He paid a soothsayer to foresee what Shakespeare's greatest play would be.

SHAKESPEARE:
That sneaky little thief! Why doesn't he come up with his own ideas!?

MAN SERVANTS:
It's hard

SHAKESPEARE:
No. It is, isn't it?
It's really the worst

MAN SERVANTS:
It's hard

SHAKESPEARE:
Makes me wonder why I didn't think of that first

MAN SERVANTS:
It's hard

SHAKESPEARE:
Hard to alleviate the pressure to create

MAN SERVANTS:
It's hard

SHAKESPEARE:
Hard to do something as good as the last thing I did that was already great

MAN SERVANTS:
It's hard

SHAKESPEARE:
It's hard,

MAN SERVANTS:
So hard that he is stealing from the bard

SHAKESPEARE:
Well I'll hoist him by his petard
All I need is a clever disguise

MAN SERVANTS:
Clever disguise

SHAKESPEARE:
I'll make him pay for those devious lies

MAN SERVANTS:
Devious lies

SHAKESPEARE:
Let him do all the tedious stuff
The work that's terribly and unbearably hard
Cause it's hard

MAN SERVANTS:
It's totally hard

SHAKESPEARE & MAN SERVANTS:
It's hard

MAN SERVANTS:
It's totally hard

SHAKESPEARE & MAN SERVANTS:
It's hard

MAN SERVANTS:
It's totally hard

SHAKESPEARE:
I've got fortune and fame
Everyone knows my name
I can't help it if it's so freakin' hard

It's Eggs!       
            Troupe:
What's that cooking on the griddle
Whipped up and beaten?
It's eggs, it's eggs, woo!

Throw some fixings in the middle
So good for eating
It's eggs, it's eggs, woo!

Nick:
I see within this fluffy form
The scrambled nature of my soul
I'm cracking up as I begin
To see the bits of me within this

All:
Om-om-om
Om-om-om
Om-om-om
Omelette!

We See the Light       
            Portia:
I'm tired of listening to the same sad story
How lovers fail because it's written in the stars
The feuding family plot is starting to bore me
I'm thinking we can show them that's not who we are

It may take a little more persuading
For those who think it's better that we are apart
I have no doubt their doubts will soon be fading
We'll show them how true love finds a way
Even though I know what they'll say

Ensemble:
No, no that won't do
God has plans for you
If you live in sin
You let the devil win
No, no that won't do

Portia:
But then they'll hear the words of truth that you've written from your heart

Nigel:
If love is a sickness
Then find me no cure
For tis only love
That I know to be pure

Ensemble:
Aww

Portia:
Then they'll think about it
And pray about it
Then their hearts will open
Then they'll be singing a different tune

Ensemble:
We see the light
You changed how we're thinking
Cause we were blind
You showed us the way
We're wrong
You're right
Salvation is yours if you do what is true to you
And you do it with love
Do it with love
Yeah, oh

Nigel:
Your father

Portia:
Yeah
He's a hard man to be moved
And he'll say

Brother Jeremiah:
This is unacceptable
I do not approve

Portia:
But I know you'll win him over
His heart is gonna sing
And he'll love you
When you do your thing

Nigel:
If love is love purely
Then let me opine
That all love is surely divine

Brother Jeremiah:
Good God, y'all
I see the light
You changed how I'm thinking
Cause I was blind
And you've shown me the way
I'm wrong
You're right

All:
Salvation is yours if you do what is true to you
And you do it with love
Do it with love

Brother Jeremiah:
Brethren (Yes)
I say unto you (Say what)
I say who are we to judge these two (So true, preach it)
He's a writer doing what he can (What he can)
She's a daughter of a preacher man (Woo!)
And they got the right to

All:
They got the right
They got the right to be together

Brother Jeremiah:
I need no further proof
These words, they speak the truth (The truth will set you free)
Set you free when you

All:
Do what is true to you
And you do it with

Nick:
Wait

Nigel:
Read

Nick:
Aww

Nigel & Portia:
Yay

All:
Love
Do it with love
Yeah
We see the light
You changed how we're thinking
Cause we were blind
You showed us the way
We're wrong
You're right
Salvation is yours if you do what is true to you
And you do it with love
Do it with love
Love
Do it with love

To Thine Own Self       
            Nigel (Spoken):
Nick, just read it
I really think I'm on to something here

Nick (Spoken):
I am reading
And where's the omelette?

Nigel (Spoken):
There is no omelette!

Nick (Spoken):
What do you mean there's no omelette?
There has to be an omelette
It's called Omelette!

Nigel:
(Spoken) Ahh!
Are you hearing yourself? (What?)
Nick, are you hearing yourself? (Yes)
I can't believe we're having a conversation about a story that has to be all about eggs (So?)
Eggs! (Yes)
What is it with you and these eggs?

Nick:
You just have to trust me
I know what I'm doing

Nigel:
I think that you're out of your mind if you think that pursuing that is a good thing

Nick:
Well I do

Nigel:
Okay, well I don't

Troupe Member (Spoken):
Read him this part, it's beautiful

Nigel (Spoken):
Doesn't matter, he won't listen

Will (Spoken):
I should really take these before this turns ugly

Troupe Member (Spoken):
Just read him what you wrote

Nick (Spoken):
What the hell are they talking about?

Nigel:
(Spoken) You asked me to write something, well here it is
Sure as the day follows into night
Sure as the sky turns to blue
This much I know
This much is true
Above all else, whatever you do

Nigel & Troupe:
To thine own self be true

Nick (Spoken):
That's it?

Troupe (Spoken):
It's beautiful
It's like good line and good advice

Will (Spoken):
I don't know
I thought the whole breakfast theme was really strong
Everyone loves breakfast

Nick (Spoken):
Exactly!
But there's no Danish, there's no ham, there's no breakfast at all!
You're completely ignoring the theme

Nigel (Spoken):
I'm ignoring the breakfast theme because it's ridiculous

Nick:
Oh, are you hearing yourself? (Nick!)
I said, are you hearing yourself? (Yes)
I can't believe you're trying to change direction
Because you decided that my ideas are wrong (Please)
I'm wrong
And this true to yourself thing is right?

Nigel:
That's not just a line
It's what I believe

Nick:
Then you are a fool and really naive
If you think it's as simple as that

Nigel:
Well I do

Nick:
Okay well I don't

Troupe (In Background):
So what do we do x5

Nigel (Spoken):
Ah, this is hopeless
I don't know how to get through to you
Nick, the fact that you think Omelette is good,
It worries me
Guys, can you help me out here

Troupe Member (Spoken):
You really should listen to him, Nick
It just makes your heart wanna soar

Troupe:
Sure as the day follows into night
Sure as the sky turns to blue
This much I know
This much is true
Above all else, whatever you do
To thine own self be true

Nick (Spoken):
Want some truth?
Here's the truth
Omelette will be known as perhaps the single greatest play ever written

Nigel (Spoken):
How can you possibly know that?

Nick (Spoken):
I just do

Troupe (In Background):
So what do we do x5

Nick (Spoken):
This will be talked about for generations to come
We need a hit
Not some audience-repelling death play about your descent into madness

Nigel (Spoken):
This descent into madness, that's you
Nick, I mean it
Whatever happened to the guy who inspired me to become a writer?

Nick (Spoken):
He finally has a great idea
Now, we open in a week
Are you going to help me write Omelette or not?

Nigel (Spoken):
No

Nick (Spoken):
No?

I can't
It doesn't feel right
And deep down, I don't think it feels right to you either

Troupe (In Background):
So what do we do x4

Nick:
I'll tell you what we do
We serve up what they're hungry for
Omelette the musical

We're on our way to glory
We'll play for kings and queens
And there and then they'll see the end will justify the means

Troupe:
The end will justify the means!
Sure as the day follows the night

Nick:
Surely we must see this through (Okay, if you say so)
Damned if I don't (Don't!)
Damned if I do (Do!)
Damn it, I don't have the luxury to
Hang all my hope on some simplistic trope
Like to thine own self (To thine own self)
Be true

Troupe Member:
Oh God, I hope what he's saying is true

Troupe:
Please be true
Please be true
Please be true

Right Hand Man (Reprise)       
            Bea:
(Spoken)
What stops us from walking out on him? I think it's because you know like I know.

(Sung)
If you ever got in trouble
He would be there on the double just to bail you out
If there's anything you lack
You know he's always got your back
That's what he's all about

He has his faults but he means well
And he always does the best that he can
But it should be understood
I wouldn't change him if I could
Cause I know his heart is good

And he'll always be your right hand man

(Spoken)
He can't do this without you, maybe it's time you carry him for a bit.

Nigel:
(Spoken)
Okay, I will

Bea:
(Spoken)
Good and I'm sure you'll give them a show they'll never forget!

Something Rotten!/Make an Omelette       
            Nick:
(Spoken) Alas, poor yolk, I know thee well
There's something rotten
There's something rotten

Nick & Troupe:
You can smell it
You can tell there's something rotten
Now the kingdom is shot
And it's all gone to pot
Heaven help us there is something rotten

[Thanks to Angela for lyrics]


Broadway's musical (2015) 
Something Rotten the Musical - Make an Omlette Lyrics

"Make an Omlette" is a song from Something Rotten! performed by Brian d'Arcy James (Nick) and Company.

Nick (Spoken):
My father newly dead and the funeral
Boiled eggs now coldly furnished for the marriage table
Methinks another chef might have whisked our desperate eggs together as one

Will (Spoken): Pray, nephew, what dost thou mean?

Nick:
(Spoken) Well, I'll tell you
The fruit of life can't always taste like sweet persimmons
Sometimes it's hard to swallow I'm afraid
But when life has handed you some lemons
Then hand it back a mug of lemonade

My father said this to me
That he did and then he blew me
Away with wisdom simple and concise
He said, "Eggbert, life is merely what you make of it
So heed this sound advice"

You make wine from sour grapes
You got a flat pancake, hey, call it a crepe
When life gives you eggs, make an omelette
You get cola from a nut
A dirty worm makes silk from out of his butt
When life gives you eggs, make an omelette
Omelette

Nick & 3 Troupe Members:
The solution to your troubles is
Cheese and vegetables
And making bacon omelette, yeah!

Nick:
When it looks like you should quit
Find another way of looking at it

Nick & 3 Troupe Members: When life gives you eggs

3 Troupe Members:
You gotta make that om-om-om
Om-om-om
Om-om-om

Omelette
Om-om-om
Om-om-om
Om-om-om
Omelette

Omelette!

Nick (Spoken): Father!

Nostradamus:
The solution to your troubles
Right here in River City
Shipoopi, Chicago
Omelette, yeah!

When it looks like you should quit

Nostradamus & Troupe:
Find another way of looking at it
When life gives you eggs
Just a great big bowl of eggs
When life gives you eggs
You gotta make that omelette

Nick & 3 Troupe Members:
Crack, splat, psss
Crack, splat, psss
Make an omelette
Crack, splat, psss
Make an omelette

3 Troupe Members:
Make an omelette
Make an omelette
Make an omelette now

Nick (Spoken): How?

3 Troupe Members:
First melt a tablespoon of butter in a medium frying pan
Over medium heat
And sautÃ© the onions and green pepper 'til they're tender
Add the ham pieces

Nick:
Make an omelette
Make an omelette
Make an omelette now

3 Troupe Members:
Turn off the heat
Let the omelette sit one minute in the skillet
So the inside cooks right through

Nick:
Take that egg and beat it
Take that egg and beat it
You gotta heat it and beat it, before you eat it
So beat that egg
Beat that egg
Beat that egg

Nick & 3 Troupe Members:
And that's how you make an omelette
That's how you make an omelette
That's how you make an omelette
That's how you make it

Woman:
And I am telling you
I'm not gonna be an omelette
Oh no, no, no

Nick (Spoken): We really beat that omelette

All:
You make wine from sour grapes
You got a flat pancake, just call it a crepe
When life gives you eggs, make an oh-oh-oh-omelette
Take an egg and pass on by
If your cholesterol's high, you'll probably die

When life gives you eggs
Just a great big bowl of eggs
When life gives you eggs
You gotta make that om-om-om
Om-om-om
Om-om-om
Om-om-om
For heaven's sakes!

It was white and yellow
And white and yellow
And white and yellow
And white
Make an omelette!

To Thine Own Self (Reprise)       
            Nick:
Sure as the day follows into night
Sure as the sky turns to blue
This much I know
This much is true
Above all else, whatever you do
To thine own self be true

Why did I wander so far from the man
That the two of you knew I could be
I lost sight of all that mattered somehow
I did not see it then
But I see it now

I just didn't think
I had it in me
So I made it harder than it had to be
Should have followed my heart
Should have listened to you
To thine own self be true

Nick & Nigel:
To thine own self be true
