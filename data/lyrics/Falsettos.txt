We are psychopathic people.
We sometimes tell a lie
But mostly we just hide behind the door.
We lie in wait for someone good to enter.

We offer food and drinks.
The lady never thinks that we're the mad?
We're often mad?
Too often mad?.
We're very mad?
That we're the mad experimenters. Call us

A Tight Knit Family       
            MARVIN:
Well, the situation's this
Its not tough to comprehend
I divorced my wife
I left my child
And I ran off with a friend

But I want a tight-knit family
I want a group that harmonizes
I want my wife and kid and friend
To pretend
Time will mend
Our pain

So I make them interact
So I don't go by the book
We all eat as one-
Wife, friend, and son-
And I sing out as I cook

I want a tight-knit family.
I hope you all enjoy linguine.
Talk till you hear the dinner bell.
Such a dear clientele.

I swear we're gonna come through it.
I fear we'll probably fight,
But nothing's impossible.
Live by your wit-?
Kid, wife, and lover will have to admit
I was right
I cushioned the fall
I want it all
I want it all
I want it?

Love is Blind       
            MENDEL:
Sit down, my dear
I hear you have a problem
I'm sure you're not disgusting or indiscreet
Take a load off your feet-

TRINA:
Love is a mess
So's my son, expressly to hurt me
Marvin, my ex-
You've seen him for years-
Told me over the phone to tell you my fears
Do you only treat queers?

MENDEL:
Breathe deep, my dear
You'll find me understanding
Your pain is a priori
Unfold you untold story
Now to break bread
Loosen your glands
Put your head in my hands

TRINA:
I'm everything he wanted
It's time I put it all together
The date was set
My father let my marry
I married. I?
Then Marvin came from work
Sat me down on the bed
He told me how he loved me
How needed, that thought valued me
I have?

MENDEL: What?

MARVIN: (as Trina mouths this) Syphilis

TRINA: He said

MENDEL: Good

TRINA: I have

MENDEL: Yes?

MARVIN: (Trina mouths) Syphilis

TRINA: It's true

MENDEL: Good

TRINA: I had something rotten
Which appears thought now it's well forgo, an?

MARVIN: Maybe, darling, so do you

TRINA: Maybe, darling, so do you

TRINA: (to Marvin) I am probably diseased

MENDEL: You're a lovely girl

TRINA: (to Marvin) And so easily appeased

MENDEL: What a lovely girl, though she's probably diseased

TRINA: He took pains to not excited us
He explains I've?

MARVIN: Hepatitis

TRINA: Too

MARVIN, JASON, AND WHIZZER: Hepa hepa hepatitis hepatitis hepatitis

MENDEL: Love is blind
Love can tell a million stories
Love's unkind
Spiteful in a million ways

TRINA: Then I stayed home from work
Took good care of my men
They faked despair, they wet their bed,
They combed their hair, they acted dead
One said?

MENDEL: Yes?

JASON: Daddy is a prick

MENDEL: What?

TRINA: He said?

MENDEL: Yes?

JASON: Daddy isn't mine

MENDEL: Good

TRINA: He filled my coats
With candies and notes, with 'Will you be my valentine'?

MARVIN: (To Whizzer) Will you be my valentine?

TRINA: This gets harder to believe

MENDEL: You're a damaged girl

TRINA: I've a scalpel up my sleeve

ALL: What a damaged girl

MENDEL: Do not ever slit your wrists

TRINA: I've missed him; he's still missing
Don't make noise, but daddy's kissing boys

ALL: Petty, petty, petty, petty

MENDEL AND TRINA: Love is blind
Love can tell a million stories
Love's unkind
Spiteful in a million ways

ALL: Love is blind
Love can tell a million stories

MARVIN/ OTHERS:
Love is crazy/ Love-
Love is often boring
Love stinks/ Love-
Love is pretty often debris
When you find/ Love-
What you find
Then never, never, never, never, never/ Love-
Do it over again

Love reads like a bad biography/ Love-
All the names are changed to protect the innocent/ Love-

ALL: Love is blind

MENDEL: My name is Mendel
I treat her husband
I think she's very insecure
But so am I
I've never married
Work, work is my passion
Or perhaps that's an alibi

(speak) I don't care to discuss it.

(sing) I think she's charming
I think she's eager
That's unprofessional and mean
But still it's true

ALL: His name is Mendel

WHIZZER: Ah-ah

MENDEL: Return next Friday I admit I admire you

Marvin at the Psychiatrist (A Three-Part Mini-Opera)       
            JASON: My father says that love
Is the most beautiful thing in the world.
I think games are,
I think chess is the most
Beautiful thing,
Not love.

WHIZZER: (speaking) Marvin at the Psychiatrist, a three-part mini opera. Part One.

MENDEL: (singing) Do you love him'

MARVIN: Sorta kinda.

MENDEL: Do you need him'

MARVIN: Sorta kinda.
He makes me smile a lot,
Especially at mealtime.
It makes me feel I'm sort of smart.

MENDEL: Mm-hmm. Is he special'

MARVIN: He's delightful.

MENDEL: And romantic'

MARVIN: Yes, but spiteful. And yet it seems that so am I.

MENDEL: Just enjoy what you can.
Love the boy, not the man.

MARVIN: Man' sorta stylish.

MENDEL: Kinda very'

MARVIN: (speaking) Mmm, very very sorta.

MENDEL: (singing) And kind of hard to describe'

MARVIN: (speaking) Yes, you know, I think that's true.

MENDEL: When he's naked,-

MARVIN: Yes'

MENDEL: Does he thrill you'

MARVIN: Yes!

MENDEL: Is he vicious'

MARVIN: Yes!

MENDEL: (thinks) Yes. I think he's sorta kinda mean.
But I love him, and I need it.
If he loved me, I'd concede it.

Don't despise what you feel.
Love the friend, not the heel.

MARVIN: Heel'

MENDEL: He's sometimes worthless'

MARVIN: Sometimes evil.

MENDEL: Sometimes smarmy'

WHIZZER: (speaking) Part Two.

MENDEL: (singing) It's queer, Mr. Marvin- sorry.

MARVIN: Jesus'

MENDEL: Strange, Mr. Marvin,
How your wife- your ex-wife's meager glories
Coupled with her tragic stories,
Moves me in unreported ways.

MARVIN: She's a very good woman.
She's a wonderful woman.

MENDEL: Do you mind that'
She was here to speak of Jason, and I find that
I hope Jason acts out more,
Cause there's a few more things we need explore.

MARVIN: (speaking) No, I understand.

MENDEL: Good! Very good. Very, very good!
I feel a lot better already.
Going on' (singing) Was she a vicious woman'

MARVIN: No.

MENDEL: Did she beat the child'

MARVIN: No!

MENDEL: Did she ever drive you wild'

MARVIN: No.

MENDEL: Never'

MENDEL: Never'

MARVIN: No, no, no!

MENDEL: Was she faithful' be objective.

MARVIN: Well, yes.

MENDEL: She was faithful!

MARVIN: Yes.

MENDEL: And her last caress was:

MARVIN: Careless.

MENDEL: You mean, 'careful'.

MARVIN: Careful, not to show she cared.

MENDEL: So you weren't prepared
For the crying,
And the screaming.

MARVIN: And the beating of the breast!
(speaking) I don't want to be rude.

MENDEL: (singing) Does she sleep in the nude'

MARVIN: ...No. Going on.

MENDEL: Did you like that'
Would she change it if she knew you didn't like that'
Did she wear a negligee'
Could you blow and it would blow away'
I don't mean to interfere.
I would like to make that very clear.

WHIZZER: (speaking) Part Three.

MARVIN: (singing) My son's distressing.

JASON: My father's snide.

MARVIN: I'm convalescing.

JASON: He's morbid and dissatisfied.

MARVIN: What should I do now'

JASON: He loves another.

MARVIN: I agree.

JASON: I love my mother.

MARVIN: Why not me' we go to ball games.

JASON: The ball is tossed.

MARVIN: The pitcher's handsome.

JASON: And our team lost.

MARVIN: Is that my problem' should I be blamed for that'

JASON: Explore museums.

MARVIN: Admire art.

JASON: We stand together.

MARVIN: But we stand there looking miles apart.
How do I reach him'
What words of wisdom'
What should I do now'

JASON: My father says that love
Is the most beautiful thing in the world.
I think games are,
I think chess is the most
Beautiful thing,
Not love.

MENDEL: (speaking) Marvin at the Psychiatrist, a three-part mini opera.
The End.

Everyone Tells Jason to See a Psychiatrist       
            TRINA:
Darling, please see a psychiatrist.
He doesn't bite, and he might
Help you understand
Why you are so angry and despised
By all those guys
Who have not been, they have not been analyzed.

Yet, sweetheart, please do not get hysterical.
Reason will win the day, trust me!
Mother never lies.
No one is saying you're a sick neurotic,
But you could find some help.
Hear me out, please.
Yes, you could find some help,
He could help you realize

How confused you are!
Yes, it's very clear.
Daddy's sincere, but a schmo!
You and I must trust our emotions,
Make no commotions.
Will you go'

Late for dinner, late again
Late for dinner, late again
Late for dinner, late, late, late, late
MARVIN:
Whizzer's supposed to always be here
Make the dinner, set to screw
That's what pretty boys should do
Check their hairlines, make the dinner
And love me

This is going nowhere and fast, Whizzer
This little thing that we have will not last
Don't feel responsible, after all it's through

WHIZZER: I'm not responsible

I'm Breaking Down       
            TRINA:
I'd like to be a princess on a throne,
To have a country I can call my own.
And a king
Who's lusty and requires a fling
With a female thing.

Great... Men will be men...
Let me turn on the gas.
I saw them in the den
With Marvin grabbing Whizzer's ass.

Oh, sure, I'm sure he's sure, he did his best.
I mean, he tried (meant) to be what I was not.
The things he was are things which I've forgot.
He's a queen.
I'm a queen.
Where is our crown?

I'm breaking down.
I'm breaking down.
My life is shitty
And my kid seems like an idiot to me.
I mean, that's wrong (sick).
I mean, he's great.
It's me who is the matter,
Talking madder than the maddest hatter.
If I repeat one more word,
I swear I'll lose my brain.
What else should I explain?
Oh yes, it's true I can cry on cue
But so can you.
I'm breaking down.
I'm breaking down.
Down. Down.
You ask me "Is it fun to cry over nothing?"
It is. I'm breaking down.

(Speaking:) 
Oh, darn, don't have time for a breakdown now.
Have to get back to my banana-carrot surprise.

(She cuts her finger while chopping.)

Oh, that really hurts.

(Singing:)
Now let's consolidate our simple thoughts.
A healthy fruit is healthy till it rots.
I agree.
We sat beneath the apple tree.
Marv, his friend, and me.

Now, speaking of friends,
Whizzer is sweet and trim.
I think he sets the trends.
I think in fact I'll marry him.
He wants me!
I wanna hate him, but I really can't.
It's like a nightmare how this all proceeds.
I hope that Whizzer don't fulfill his need.
"Don't" is wrong.
Sing along.
What was the noun?

I'm breaking down.
I'm breaking down.
I'll soon redecorate these stalls.
I'd like some padding on the walls.
And also pills.
I wanna sleep.
Sure things will prob'ly worsen,
But it's not like I'm some healthy person.
I've rethought my talks with Marv,
And one fact does emerge:
I think I like his shrink.
So that is why I could use a (should turn to) drink.
I'm on the brink of breaking down.
I'm breaking down.
Down. Down.
I only want to love a man who can love me
Or like me
Or help me.

Marvin was never mine.
He took his meetings in the boys' latrine.
I used to cry.
He'd make a scene.
I'd rather die than dry clean
Marvin's wedding gown.
I'm breaking down.
I'm breaking down.
It's so upsetting when I found
That what's rectangular is round.
I mean, it stinks.
I mean, he's queer.
And me, I'm just a freak
Who needs it maybe every other week!
I've rethought the fun we had,
And one fact does emerge:
I've played a foolish clown.
The almost-virgin who sings this dirge
Is on the verge of breaking down.
I'm breaking down.
Down. Down.
The only thing that's breaking up
Is my family.

The only thing that's breaking up
Is my family.
But me, I'm breaking down. Down.

Jason's Therapy       
            Album Falsettos (Revival Cast Production)
JASON'S THERAPY LYRICS
JASON
Mr. Mendel
I get apoplexy thinking of my father
I resemble him in far too many ways
His sad demeanor
The way he acts the swine
At least his room is cleaner than mine
Is it fatal?
Do you see real similarities between us?
He and Whizzer live like...
Well, I think it's clear
What do I do?
What do I say?
How do I ask?
What do I hope for?
Is it my mind?
Love isn't free
If love isn't blind
What do I see?

MENDEL
Stop!
Look around you
No one's screaming at you
So you feel alright for about ten minutes
If you feel alright for about ten minutes
Why don't you feel alright for about twenty minutes?
Feel alright for about forty minutes?
Drop it and smile

Why don't you feel alright for the rest of your life?
Why don't you feel alright for the rest of your life?
Why don't you feel alright for the rest of your life?

JASON
Is this therapy?

TRINA
Chop chop chop chop chop
I chopped it
It's a gourmet version of chicken merengo
Took me all day
I'll say 'twas worth the time
I lie

MARVIN
Why is he always here?

WHIZZER
The psychiatrist returning
Returning
Five sessions later

MENDEL
Try to forget all things homely
Try to forget all things snide
Nothing's as good as you recall
Count what's good, then divide

If you can count, it's alright
You can figure out the world
You can add and subtract at will
You can cover up the past
You can kill the pain
Very easily

JASON
Is this therapy?

MARVIN, TRINA, WHIZZER, AND MENDEL
Right, this is therapy!

JASON
So scram
Mr. Mendel
As regarding your intentions to my mother
Are they everything a woman would desire?
Her hand is ready
It only needs a ring
I'd buy confetti
And sing
I'm embarrassed
It's not my responsibility to ask you
But I wonder if it ever crossed your mind?

MENDEL
What do I say?
Where do I look?
Why do I laugh?
How do I answer?
Is it my mind?
Love isn't free
If love isn't blind
What do I see?

JASON
Stop!
Look around you
A lot of nice furniture
Someone's bringing you dinner
Someone brought you your lunch
Someone's washing your laundry
Washing your socks
Jesus Christ!
Why don't you feel alright for the rest of your life?
Why don't you feel alright for the rest of your life?

JASON/MENDEL
Why don't you/I feel alright for the rest of your/my life?
Whoo!

MARVIN, TRINA, WHIZZER, JASON, AND MENDEL
Why don't you feel alright for the rest of your life?
Why don't you feel alright for the rest of your life?
Why don't you feel alright for the rest of your life?
Feel, feel, feel, feel alright
Feel, feel, feel, feel alright
Feel, feel, feel, feel alright
Feel alright for the rest of your
Rest of your
Life

A Marriage Proposal       
            JASON: (speaking) This is how you make a marriage proposal.

MENDEL: (singing)
I love you dear.
I think you're swell.
You're never near me close enough to tell
If I'm delightful or not.

I need your wrist.
I praise your thigh.
There's not a guy,
There's not a piece of paper,
There's not a man in pants
Who could love you the same as I!

Oftentimes, lovers are crazy people.
Sometimes they kill each other.
Just like a biblical brother
Did to his biblical brother
Back in biblical times.

TRINA: Biblical times?

MARVIN: (speaking) Biblical times?

MENDEL: Uh, biblical times. (singing) Oh, those' biblical times!

I love your eyes.
I love your face.
I want you by my side to take my place
If I get sick or detained.

Don't brush your hair, you?re perfect.
Don't start to cry.
There's not a guy,
There's not a horse or zebra,
There's not a giant man
Who could love you the same as I!

Forget that giant man,
He won't love you the same as I!
I'm not a giant man,
But I'll love you until,
Love you until,
I die!

Trina's Song       
            TRINA:
I'm tired of all the happy men who rule the world.
Their smile,
Their smiles, their pedigree.
They smile,
But not for me.
I'd like a chance to hide
In their world.

I'm happy, but I'm not at ease with that whole world.
There's trust,
He lets me move,
And lust,
Which I approve.

I need those crass, indulgent stares.
He pats my ass and says he cares.
The smile will come at will,
But still.

I'm not exactly happy,
Though he's absolutely nice.
And he caters to my family,
Sometimes for a price.
But he's cocky and he's charming,
Funny as the day is long,
And he's mine.
What's so wrong'

I'll be absolutely faithful.
He may go and play the field.
I'll stay home and smile at Jason,
All ambivalence concealed.
He must tell me how he loves me,
Make it seem like he's inspired.
And I'll roar,
Like I'm wired.

I'll explore what I'm feeling,
Accept what I'm feeling is 'tired'.
I'm tired,
So tired of all the happy men who rule the world.
I'll laugh,
Then watch us fade.
I'll laugh,
Then fire the maid.

I'm sick to try, I'm too prepared.
I'm duly warned and duly scared.
My life is now on trial.
I smile.

Trina's Song (Reprise)       
            TRINA
Please forgive my former shpielingâ
It does not concern the man
As for doubts that I've been feeling
I'll ignore them when I can
And the things that I must do
I'll do to make this all succeed
I'll commit, that's agreed
And with wit and precision
I've made a decision
To get the things I need
God, I'll try, I'll try, I'll cry

No, I'll laugh â then unafraid
I'll laugh - and hire a maid
I'll fight the gods. I'll fight my ex
I'll beat the odds. I'll have good sex
My future's now on trial
I smile

With paintings all around.

The Games I Play       
            I don't look for trouble
I do not accept blame
I've a good and a bad side
But they're one and the same
Ask me to arouse you
I will rise and obey
These are the games I play

I screw every morning
Then bathe and drink tea
I been playing canasta
Disasta-
rously
All my recreation seems to suit me okay
These are the games I play

It's tough with love
Love's tough to show
Let me face the music
It's a song that I was waiting to hear so long
So long ago

I bet on the horses
I die by degree
I am sure his divorce is
A tribute to me
Ask me if I love him
It depends on the day
These are the games I play

It's tough, my friend
Love's looking strong
Play again the music
It's a song that I been waiting to hear
For much to long
Years, years too long

It hurts not to love him
It hurts when love fades
It's hard when part of him
Is off playing fam'ly charades

Ask me if I need him
Get him out of my way
These are
These are the games
These are the games
These are the only games I play

I meant no disgrace.
This here is love,
When we're talking
Face to face.

Father to son,
I, for one, would take love slower.
I've made my choice,
But you can sing a different song.
Watch as you sing,
How your voice gets much lower.

You'll be, kid, a man, kid,
If nothing goes wrong.

Baruch, baruch atoh,
Baruch atoh adonai,
Baruch atoh adonai elohenu,
Meluch haolum.

TRINA: Jason dear, hello.
Are you packed and waiting?
But before we go,
Let me talk with father alone.

Now as the bar mitzvah nears-
Jason, put your walkerman on and hum.
Since this is the last loving thing we?ll probably ever do together,
Let's act adult and not go crazy.

MARVIN: Have you chosen yet who?ll cater?

Throw a simple party!
Religion's just a trap
That ensnares the weak and the dumb.
Stop with the prayers.

TRINA: How can you 'stop with the prayers' at a bar mitzvah?

MENDEL: The whole thing?s voodoo,
And I know more than you do!

MARVIN & TRINA: 
This is the year of Jason's bar mitzvah!
We're more excited than we should be.
This is the year of the child
When he spreads out his wings!
There's music in his heart!
His life's about to start!
His body's going wild!
My child?

MARVIN: My child?

TRINA: Our child.

MENDEL: Children, please.
Throw the kid a celebration and relax.
I'll bring women from the wrong side of the tracks.
We'll have a ball!
I guess I?ll have to raise this Jason myself.

MARVIN: Isn't he annoying?

TRINA: Yes, he is.

MARVIN: Isn't he too much?

TRINA: Yes, but so are you. Really, kiddo, so are you.

MARVIN: Jesus, he's annoying! Jason, where's my hug?

TRINA: Where's my hug?

MENDEL: (overlapping)
My own bar mitzvah was
A miserable occasion,
The cause for such abrasion in my family!
It still gives me hives!

MARVIN, TRINA, and MENDEL:
This is the year for Jason's bar mitzvah,
This is the year for Jason's bar mitzvah!

CHARLOTTE: Look, look, look, look, look,
It's a lesbian from next door!

CORDELIA: Followed by her lover,
Who's a lesbian from next door too!
And I've got food for you,
Delicious food for you!
Nouvelle bar mitzvah cuisine!

TRINA: Ah?

CORDELIA: Here's dietetic knishes, gefilte fishes,
Food that's from the heart!

MENDEL: I'll have seconds, please!

CORDELIA: So take a bite and see
If all your friends agree
It's good!

EVERYONE but JASON:
Yummy yummy,
Yummy yummy,
Yummy yummy,
Yummy yummy,
Yummy yummy yummy yummy yum!

We'll have one perfect time!
We'll spend billions of dollars!

MENDEL: Conga?

EVERYONE but JASON:
We'll have flowers galore,
And the band will sound fine!
There'll be chandeliers set round the room
With the men in tuxedos!

There'll be food, like food never before!
What a day to remember!
This is the year of Jason's bar mitzvah!

JASON: They're more excited than they should be.

EVERYONE but JASON:
This is the year of the child
When he spreads out his wings!
There's music in his heart!
His life's about to start!
His body's going wild!
My

ALL: (breaking off and harmonizing) Child!

Miracle of Judaism       
            JASON:
Dot Nardoni, Tiffany Axelrod,
Zoe Feinstein, Angelina Dellibovi,
Bunny Doyne, or what's her name'
Mo Cristofaro, Heather Levin,
Brittany Rosenthal, which'
Flo Giu... Giu... what is the name of that bitch'
Flo Giuseppe, right, but it borders on kitsch.

Of these girls,
Which should I invite to my bar mitzvah'
I've a problem to flaunt:
I don't want the girls I should want.

(His family cheers him on at the baseball game)

I want girls for whom I lust,
Girls who wear a lot of makeup,
Girls who smoke and show their bust,
Girls with whom I always wake up-

(Jason misses the ball, the guy says 'strike one!', his family is sad)

Would they come though,
If they were invited,
And not laugh
At my hebrew
And not laugh
At my father and his friends'

(Jason misses the ball again, the guy says 'strike two!', his family is sad again)

Excluding them, I find exciting.
And I'm left with them, I'll be inviting.
Selecting girls for one's bar mitzvah.
God, that's the miracle of Judaism.

(Jason freaking misses the ball again, the guy says 'strike three, you're out!')

That'd be the miracle of Judaism.

The Baseball Game

ALL: Weâre sitting
And watching Jason play baseball,
Weâre watching Jason play baseball!
Weâre watching Jewish boys,
Who cannot play baseball, play baseball!
Weâre watching Jewish boys,
Who cannot play baseball play-

MARVIN: I hate baseball, I really do!
Unlike the rest of you,
I hate baseball!

CORDELIA & CHARLOTTE: We really wish heâd take this more seriously!

MENDEL: I like how he swings the bat!

MARVIN: Itâs good how he swings the bat.
But why does he have to throw like thatâ

ALL: Weâre sitting
And watching Jason make errors,
The most pathetical errors!
Weâre watching Jewish boys,
Who almost read Latin,
Up, battinâ,
And battinâ bad!

MENDEL: Remember Sandy Koufax!
You can do it if you wanna do it!
Take heart from Hank Greenberg!
Itâs not genetic,
Anything can be copasetic!
I think, I think,
I think it can, I think it can!

ALL: Weâre sitting
And watching Jason play baseball,
Weâre watching Jason play baseball!
Weâre watching Jewish boys,

Slide, Jason!
Slideâ

(WHIZZER enters)

MARVIN: Whatâs Whizzer doing hereâ

TRINA: What are you doing hereâ

WHIZZER: Jason asked me to come. Since he asked me to come, I came.

TRINA: Just what I wanted at a Little League game.
My ex-husbandâs ex-lover!
Isnât that what every mother dreams about
Having at a Little League gameâ

MENDEL: Looking at Whizzer is like eating treyf.

CORDELIA: The kid was out!

CHARLOTTE: The kid was safe!

CORDELIA: The kid was out!

CHARLOTTE: The kid was safe!

WHIZZER: Hey!
I love baseball,
I love baseball.
Thatâs what Iâm doing here.

CHARLOTTE: (spoken) Aw, where the hell did they get that umpireâ!

TRINA: Hi, Whizzer. (chuckles)

WHIZZER: Hey.

MARVIN: (sung) Look whoâs here. Say hello.

WHIZZER: Hello.

MARVIN: And youâre looking sweeter than a donut.

WHIZZER: Marvin.

MARVIN: Whizzer.

WHIZZER: Heâs still queer.

MARVIN: Am I queerâ

TRINA: I donât know!

MENDEL: Does it matterâ

MARVIN: Itâs been so long since I could tell.
Move in front of me,
I wanna see the bald spot!
Câmon, câmon.
Sit in front of me,
It gives me pleasure to see the bald spot!
Since itâs the only
Physical imperfection that youâve got.
I wanna see it!
I wanna touch it!
I wanna run my hands through it!

ALL except MARVIN: Weâre sitting
And watch the kid as he misses!
Weâre watching Marvin throw kisses,
Weâre watching sixty-seven pounders,
Watching Jewish boys in scroungers,

ALL: Watching boys feel, boys bat,
Boys miss, boys at-
Watching Jason on deck,
Swinging the bat!

WHIZZER: Keep your head in the box.
Donât think of a thing,
Keep your head in the box,
Your eye on the ball,
Take a breath, then let it out
And swing!

(Whizzer and everyone else repeat last verse, overlapping)

MARVIN: Even bald, he looks good.

WHIZZER: Just remember heâs an asshole.

MARVIN: He looks damn good, but heâs cheap as dirt.

WHIZZER: Even maniacs can charm,
Which he does, so beware.

MARVIN: And just be careful.

WHIZZER: When he smiles that smile, avoid him,
Or else sound the alert!

MARVIN & WHIZZER: How could I know, without him,
My life would be boring as shitâ

MARVIN: But it is.

WHIZZER: (spoken) Jason! You gotta move a little closer to the plate!

MARVIN: (sung) Oh, yes, it is-
(spoken) Whatâ Heâs gonna be hit by the ball!

MARVIN & WHIZZER: (sung) Please, God, donât let me make the same mistake!

ALL: Weâre sitting
And watching Jason, the batter!
We know our cheering wonât matter!
It is the very final inning
And the other team is winning,
And thereâs two outs, two strikes,
But the bases are loaded and-

MARVIN: Could it be possible to see you, or to kiss you,
Or to give you a callâ

ALL: Anythingâs possible, Jason
Hit the ball!
(spoken) Run!

A Day in Falsettoland       
            WHIZZER: (speaking) A Day In Falsettoland, Dr. Mendel At Work.

CAROLINE: You go out on the streets,
And there are all these people asking for a handout!
You go home, you open up your mail,
And it's full of people asking for a donation!
And you turn on the TV and they want money for starving children in Ethiopia!
I just want to be left alone!

MENDEL: (overlapping) (singing)
I don't get it! I don't understand!
In the 60s, everyone had heart.
In the 60s, we were all a part of the same team.
In the 60s, we had a new world to start!
Could this- oh God, don't say this-
Could this be the new world we started'
Here I sit, brokenhearted and-

CAROLINE: (speaking) Do I wait for the promotion, or do I take this IBM job'

MENDEL: Yeah, well, Caroline' Hmm.
(singing) I don't get it!
I've been left behind,
Half my patients, yuppie pagans
Modeled on the Ronald Reagans!
Now the world is too pathetic,
And I don't get it at all!

CAROLINE: (speaking) Oh, I'm in a deep quandary about my career. What do you think I should do'

MENDEL: Time's up.

CAROLINE: Awww.

MENDEL: (singing) At least there's Trina at home,
Trina in bed, Trina obsessing and sort of caressing
My head with her feet.
I once thought it was sweet,
But I don't anymore.
Now I just snore,

Cause I'm so exhausted,
Listening as those yuppie farts complain,
Listening as their shallow hearts explain
Their lives.

CHARLOTTE: (speaking) Trina Works It Out.

TRINA: (singing) Marvin's back with Whizzer,
Just like how it was.
If I don't like Whizzer,
It's because my ex sure does.

Why should that affect me'
Sometimes I'm a lout.
Mendel serenades and Jason calms me.
Why should I be wilting
When their precious love is not in doubt'
Work it out!

JASON: The Neighbors Relax!

CORDELIA: How was your day at the hospital'

CHARLOTTE: Unbelieveable! What is that smell'

MENDEL: Drop it, sweetheart.
Give it up, you know I love you.
Honey, sweetheart, what's the matter'
I don't get it. Why don't you let go'

TRINA: After the first mile, I'll be OK. I cannot let go until we have this bar mitzvah.

MENDEL: Isn't it enough I want you every night'

TRINA: Heh.

MENDEL: Every other night'

TRINA: Hehehehehe.

Everything will be alright.

TRINA: Everything will be alright.

MENDEL & TRINA: Everything will be alright.

CORDELIA: How was your day at the hospital'

CHARLOTTE: It was wonderful.
For the first time in months, nobody died.
There were just heart attacks and gallstones,
Light bulbs up the ass,
Fake appendicitis, which is gas,
Which I diagnosed. People overdosed
And I saved them.

I save the young people, old people,
One priest and one high school principal!
Saving lives, I feel invincible!
Yes, I do!

Do you know how great my life is'
Do you know how great my life is,
Saving lives and loving you'

And muy disappointe, and muy naseatus,
And me mitzraim hotzionoo dayenu!
Oh, day, dayenu! Day, dayenu! Day, dayenu!

Everyone hates his parents,
Don't be ashamed.
You'll grow up, you'll come through,
You'll have kids, and they'll hate you too!
Oh, everyone hates his parents,
But, I confess,
You grow up, you get old, you hate less!

JASON: But I don't want it.
Nothing that gives them pleasure, I'll do.
I don't want a bar mitzvah,
Want a bar mitzvah,
Want a bar mitzvah. Would you'

MENDEL: Everyone hates his parents.
That's in the Torah!
It's what history shows!
In fact, God said to Moses, 'Moses,
Everyone hates his parents,
That's how it is.'
And God knew because God hated his!

MARVIN: You are gonna kill your mother.
Don't feel guilty, kill your mother.
Rather than humiliate her,
Killing your mother is the merciful thing to do.

TRINA: Jason, darling, don't get nervous.
I'm right here and at your service.
Look, I'm calm and self-deluded,
Grateful cause I hope you'll do what I pray you'll do.

MARVIN: Go ahead and kill your mother.

TRINA: Not with guns, but kill your mother.

MARVIN & TRINA: Rather than humiliate her, killing your mother is the merciful thing to do.

JASON: Ugh!

MENDEL: Everyone hates his parents.
Now I see why! But in time, they'll cool out
And you'll think, 'They were only fooling'.
It's a strange thing about parents,
Push comes to shove,
What was hate becomes more or less love!

MARVIN & TRINA: Jason, please see a psychiatrist.

MENDEL: (speaking) I'm a psychiatrist! Get lost!

What More Can I Say       
            MARVIN:
It's been hot,
Also very sweet.
And I'm not usually indiscreet.
But when he sparkles,
The earth begins to sway.
What more can I say?
How can I express
How confused am I by our happiness?
I can't eat breakfast,
I cannot tie my shoe.
What more can I do?

If I said I love him,
You might think my words come cheap.
Let's just say
I'm glad he's mine awake,
Asleep.

It's been hot
Also it's been swell.
More than not,
It's been more than words can tell.
I halt.
I stammer.
I sing a rondelay.
What more can I say?

I'll stay calm.
Untie my tongue.
And try to stay
Both kind and young.

I was taught
Never brag or shout.
Still it's hot,
Just like how you read about.
And also funny,
And never too uncouth.
That's the simple truth.

(WHIZZER is sleeping face up. MARVIN looks underneath the sheet and is
stunned by his good fortune.)

Can you tell
I have been revised?
It's so swell,
Damn it, even I'm surprised.
We laugh,
We fumble
We take it day by day.
What more can I say?

I make a big stink when I must, but goddamn!
I'm just professional, never too nonchalant.
If I'm a bitch, well, I am what I am!

Just call me 'Doc', don't call me 'lady'.
I don't like to talk when I'm losing the game.

They leave weeks later unenlightened.

Holding to the Ground       
            TRINA
I was sure growing up I would live the life
My mother assumed I'd live
Very Jewish, very middle-class, and very straight
Where healthy men stayed healthy men
And marriages were long and great
I smile
I don't complain

I'm trying to keep sane as the rules keep changing
Families aren't what they were
Thank God there's a husband and a child whom I adore
But then there's more
So many more
There's always more

Life is never what you planned
Life is moments you can't understand
And that is life
I'm plain
I don't astound

I hold to the ground
As the ground keeps shifting
Keeping my balance square
Trying not to care about this man who Marvin loves
But that's my life
He shared my life
Yes, that's my life

Life is never what you planned
Life is moments you can't understand
And that is life

Holding to the ground
As the ground keeps shifting
Trying to keep sane
As the rules keep changing
Keeping up my head
As my heart falls out of sight
Everything will be all right
Everything will be all right

TRINA: (overlapping) He'll make you well! He'll make you well! He'll make you well!

EVERYONE except WHIZZER:
But today you seem to be
On the way to recovery!
Oh, Whizzer, I want to applaud!
It's days like this we almost believe in God,
Days like this we almost believe in God,
Days like this we almost believe in God,
Days like this we almost believe
In

CORDELIA: Gefilte fish!

MENDEL: I'll make you well!

CORDELIA: Canadelach!

EVERYONE except WHIZZER: God!

Cancelling the Bar Mitzvah       
            TRINA
Jason, if you want a Bar Mitzvah
God knows, you can have a Bar Mitzvah
But I have to know
And I have to know now
Just what it is you want
I've addressed the invitations
Here's your chance to give me Hell
If you think it's bust
Then it's probably just
As well

JASON
Can't we wait 'til Whizzer gets better?
Can't we wait 'til he's out?
That's what bar mitzvahs should be all about!
Good friends close at hand -
Don't you understand?

MENDEL
We can't be sure when
He'll get better
When, or if
He'll ever get better
But the hall is booked
And the band's been retained
So, Jason, please
What we'll do is your decision
There's no right and there's no wrong
Just say yes or no
And we'll promise to go along

JASON
Finally, now, it's all my decision
Like it's my bar mitzvah
Just like nothing happened
Hell, let's have a party
Just like nothing happened
Why don't you make this dumb decision yourselves
Okay?
Why don't you make this dumb decision yourselves?

MENDEL
We'll have the bar mitzvah?

JASON
No

TRINA
So, we'll cancel the bar mitzvah?

JASON
No!

TRINA AND MENDEL
We'll wait until you've made a decision

TRINA
Now what do we do?

MENDEL
Why don't we tell him
That we don't have the answers?
And that life can be grim
Life's not all about him
And things rarely go according to plan
Tell him things happen
For no damned good reason
That his lack of control
Kills what's best in your soul
And this is the start
To his becoming a man

TRINA
Holding to the ground
As the ground keeps shifting

MENDEL
Trying to keep sane
As the rules keep changing

TRINA AND MENDEL
Keeping up my head
As my heart falls out of sight
Everything will be alright

Unlikely Lovers       
            MARVIN: Who'd believe that we two
Would end up as lovers?

WHIZZER:
Do you want me to reply?
MARVIN
Him and me, you and I
Passionately lovers

WHIZZER: Please don't get morbid

MARVIN: Right

WHIZZER: It's just-

MARVIN: Don't fight

WHIZZER: That I haven't died yet

MARVIN: Just stop it

WHIZZER: I'm sick, but kicking

MARVIN: Geez

WHIZZER: Alright

MARVIN: Louise

WHIZZER: Good night

MARVIN:
I'm staying here in this spot
Whether you want me to or not
I'm staying
Here I am, by your side
One old horny lover

WHIZZER: Please go home and don't be scared

MARVIN:
What's the fuss? I'm not scared
What good is a lover who's scared?
Hit me if you need to
Slap my face or hold me till winter
Oh, baby, please do
I love you too
My lover

WHIZZER:
Marvin, just go home and turn on TV
Drink a little something till you're 'dead'
Think of me around
Sleeping soundly in our bed
Marvin, did you hear what I said?

MARVIN:
Shut your mouth, go to sleep
Time I met a sailor
Are you sleeping yet or...?
What is what? Whizzer, but
I can't help but feeling I've failed
Let's be scared together
Let's pretend that nothing is awful

WHIZZER: There's nothing to fear

MARVIN: There's nothing to fear'

WHIZZER: Just stay right here

MARVIN AND WHIZZER: I love you

(Dr. Charlotte and Cordelia enter)

CHARLOTTE: Shhh. Maybe he's tired

CORDELIA: Shhh. Maybe he's waiting for us

CHARLOTTE: Shhh. Maybe he's waiting for a visit

CHARLOTTE AND CORDELIA:
Is it a bad time? We'll come back
If it's a bad time, we'll come back
We'll come in

MARVIN: Look at us, four old friends
Four unlikely lovers

CORDELIA: We don't know what time will bring

WHIZZER: I've a clue

MARVIN: I have too

CHARLOTTE AND CORDELIA: Let's look like we haven't

MARVIN, CHARLOTTE, AND CORDELIA: And each say nothing

WHIZZER: Sky!

CHARLOTTE: It's blue!

MARVIN: I love the sky!

CORDELIA: I love the trees!

MARVIN: I love bad weather!

CHARLOTTE: I love the earth beneath my feet!

WHIZZER: I love friends that hover!

MARVIN, WHIZZER, CHARLOTTE, AND CORDELIA:
Gee, we love to eat
And we need something sweet
To love!

What a group we four are
Four unlikely lovers
And we vow that we will
Buy the farm, arm in arm
Four unlikely lovers with heart
Let's be scared together
Let's pretend that nothing is awful

WHIZZER, CHARLOTTE, AND CORDELIA: There's nothing to fear

MARVIN: There's nothing to fear

WHIZZER, CHARLOTTE, AND CORDELIA:
Just stay right here
I love you. (Whizzer to Marvin, Charlotte to Cordelia)

MARVIN: I love you. (to Whizzer)

WHIZZER, CHARLOTTE, AND CORDELIA: I love you. (Charlotte/Cordelia to Marvin/Whizzer)

MARVIN: I love you (to Charlotte, Cordelia, and Whizzer)

Another Miracle of Judaism       
            JASON
Hello, God
I don't think we've ever really spoken
If you'd kindly allow
How about a miracle now?

I don't know if you exist
I can't hear your fingers snappin'
Are you just a big psychiatrist?
Or, can you make things not happen?
Do this for me
And I'll get bar mitzvahed
In exchange for
Could you please make my friend stop dying?
I am not naive
It won't be easy
But if you could make my friend stop dying
God
That'd be the miracle of Judaism
That'd be the miracle of Judaism

You Gotta Die Sometime       
            Okay, when the doctor started using phrases like "You'll pass away".
What could i say? I said, 
"Doctor, in plain english tell me why was I chosen why me of al men, 
docter here's the good part at least death means 
I'll never be scared about dying again. 

Lets get on with living while we can 
And not play dunb deaths gonna come 
And when it does screw the nerves I'll be eating hors'deavres 
It's the roll of the dice and no crime, you gotta die sometime.

Death is not a friend but I hope in the end he takes me in his arms 
And lets me hold his face, 
He takes me in his arms and whispers something funny, 
He lifts me in his arms and tells me to embrace his attack.

Then the scene goes to black. Life sucks people always hate a loser 
And they hate lame ducks screw me and shucks thats it thats the ball game 
I don't smoke don't do drugs and then comes the bad news. 

I quit thats the ball game 
It's the chink in the armor the shit in the karma the blues. 
Can I keep my cool despite the urge to fall apart how should 
I start i would cry is I could but it does no damn good to explain 
I'm a man in my prime. You gotta die sometime. 

Deaths a funny pal with a weird sort of talent 
He puts his arms around my neck and walks me to the bed. 
He pins me up against the wall and kisses me like crazy the many stupid things 
I thought about with dread now delight then the scne goes to white. 

Give me the balls to orchestrate a gracful 
Leave thats my reprieve to go out without care my head high 
In the air it's the last little mountain i'll climb, 
I'll climb you gotta die sometime, 
You gotta die sometime you gotta die sometime you gotta die sometime,
Sometime, sometime, sometime. 
Somtime, sometime, sometime, sometime.

Jason's Bar Mitzvah       
            JASON
Whizzer, hey!
Suddenly it all came clear:
I said, let's have my bar mitzvah here!

MARVIN, TRINA, MENDEL, JASON, CHARLOTTE, CORDELIA
Surprise!

MARVIN
This was Jason's first-rate idea!
And I brought the prayer shall

MARVIN, TRINA, MENDEL, JASON, CHARLOTTE, CORDELIA
Ooo
It's Jason's bar mitzvah!

MENDEL
Don't you move
Everything will soon be great
Close your eyes
While we redecorate

CORDELIA
I'll unwrap the billion hors d'oeuvres
And someone, eat them, please

TRINA

ALL
Ooo
It's Jason's bar mitzvah!

TRINA
Lovely, flowers make things lovely
Champagne makes things lovely, too
Everything's amiss

MENDEL
Drink up!
Anyone for bubbly?

TRINA
Probably, it's doubly
Useful at a time like this
Cheers

MENDEL AND WHIZZER
Cheers

TRINA
And aren't things lovely?
I feel more helpless than I have in years

MARVIN
Try this on
Mendel, get this in gear

WHIZZER
Please excuse me
If I interfere
But I feel that, since I'm the host
It's me who should toast him

MARVIN, WHIZZER, TRINA, MENDEL, CHARLOTTE, CORDELIA
Ooo, ooo

WHIZZER
To Jason's bar mitzvah!

(the men depart to help Jason get ready)

CHARLOTTE
I notified the nurses
Told them please to not intrude

CORDELIA
I passed around the food
And dumped some extra food
'Cause, Lord knows, we've got plenty

CHARLOTTE
She's cooked for some 200 guests

CORDELIA
We number not that many
Actually..., we're seven

CHARLOTTE
Maybe it's not dumb
The way this whole thing ends
The food tastes really yummy

TRINA
It does

CORDELIA
Oh, mummy

TRINA
Lovely

CHARLOTTE AND CORDELIA
The flowers seem to sparkle
The candelabra sets the tone

TRINA
I must make things

CHARLOTTE AND CORDELIA
The wine is very soothing

TRINA
Lovely

CHARLOTTE AND CORDELIA
Soothes the "something, something"
Someone needed soothing

TRINA
Put everything

CHARLOTTE
I think, perhaps, I'm overdressed

TRINA
In its place

CORDELIA
I think, perhaps, it doesn't matter

TRINA
Ready for the

CORDELIA
That you are

TRINA
Band

CHARLOTTE AND CORDELIA
Here we are
Jason's bar mitzvah looks
Like the books
Say it should

TRINA, CHARLOTTE, AND CORDELIA
Cheers

TRINA
And aren't things lovely?

CHARLOTTE AND CORDELIA
Everything is lovely

TRINA, CHARLOTTE, AND CORDELIA
I feel more helpless than I have in years

MENDEL AND WHIZZER
Here he comes

MENDEL
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun
Fix his tie
Trina, try
To make him smile more

WHIZZER, TRINA, MENDEL, CHARLOTTE, CORDELIA
Don't know why
But he looks like Marvin

MARVIN
How did you turn out so great?
Who do I thank for the man you've turned into?
Kid, do you know
How proud I am?
If I don't show
How proud I am...
You hold my dreams
Kid, I burst at the seams
'Cause of you

MENDEL
Son of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
Son of Marvin, Son of Trina, Son of Whizzer, Son of Mendel

What Would I Do?       
            MARVIN (left alone): What would I do
If I had not met you?
Who would I blame my life on?
Once I was told
That all men get what they deserve.
Who the hell then threw this curve?
There are no answers.
But who would I be
If you had not been my friend?

You're the only one,
One out of a thousand others,
Only one my child would allow.
When I'm having fun,
You're the one I wanna talk to.
Where have you been?
Where are you now?

(WHIZZER appears behind MARVIN, dressed as we first saw him. 
MARVIN turns around, sees WHIZZER and catches his breath.)

What would I do
If I had not loved you?
How would I know what love is?
God only knows, too soon
I'll remember your faults.
Meanwhile, though, it's tears and schmaltz.

There are no answers.
But what would I do
If you had not been my friend?

WHIZZER:
All your life you've wanted men,
And when you got it up to have them,
Who knew it could end your life?

MARVIN:
I left my kid and left my wife
To be with you,
To be insulted by such handsome men.

(They face each other.)

WHIZZER: Do you regret--?

MARVIN (stopping him):
I'd do it again.
I'd like to believe that I'd do it again
And again and again...
And
What more can I say?

WHIZZER: What more can I say?

MARVIN: How am I to face tomorrow?

BOTH: After being screwed out of today. Tell me what's in store.

MARVIN: Yes, I'd beg or steal or borrow
If I could hold you for
One hour more.

WHIZZER: One hour more.

MARVIN: One hour more.

WHIZZER: One hour more.

BOTH: One hour, one hour more.

MARVIN: What would I do

WHIZZER: What would I do

MARVIN: If I had not seen you?

WHIZZER: If I had not seen you?

BOTH: Who would I feast my eyes on?
Once I was told
That good men get better with age.

MARVIN: Were just gonna skip that stage.

There are no answers.
But what would I do
If you hadn't been my friend?

WHIZZER: There are no answers. But what would I do...

(WHIZZER exits)

MARVIN: No simple answers.
But what would I do
If you had not been
My friend. My friend. My friend.

(First JASON, then everyone else gathers around MARVIN.)

MENDEL: Homosexuals.
Women with children.
Short insomniacs.
We're a teeny tiny band.
Lovers come and lovers go.
Lovers live and die fortissimo.
This is where we take a stand.
Welcome to Falsettoland.

(DR. CHARLOTTE walks in and joins the circle at the same time as MENDEL. TRINA consoles MARVIN.)
