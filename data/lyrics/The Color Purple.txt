            Shug
You not ugly. You the grace of god if us ever see it.
You don't believe me.
Miss celie . . . Miss celie, look here. Look at yourself.
I've always been the kind of gal
That had a lot to say.
I says the things that's on my mind,
Too dumb to shy away.
But you hush my mouth and still me
With a song i've never heard.
I guess that means that you are just
Too beautiful for words.
I've seen this life from high and low
And all that's in between.
I danced with dukes, crooned with counts,
Been courted like a queen.
But when i see what's in your heart,
All the rest is blurred.
The grace you bring into this world's
Too beautiful for words.
You hide your head under your wing
Just like a little bird.
Oh, don't you know you're beautiful,
Too beautiful for words?
Celie, you're too beautiful for words.

Stamps.
Celie
It's from nettie!
Nettie appears in her white dress in celie's memory.
Nettie
Dear celie, i know you think i am dead. But i am not. I've been writing every week
All these years, but i guess you haven't gotten any of my letters because you haven't
Written back.
Celie
She's alive.
Nettie
You probably won't get this one either, 'cause i'm sure mister is still the only one to
Take mail out of the box, but if you do, one thing i want you to know, i love you, and
I am not dead.
Celie (clutching the letter to her heart)

The Color Purple

God forgot about me!
Shug
God takin' his time getting around to you, i admit, but look at all he give us.
Laughin', and singin', and sex. Sky over our heads, birds singin' to us. I think it piss
God off if anybody even walk past the color purple in a field and not notice it. He
Say, "look what i made for you."
Celie
God just another man, far as i'm concerned, he triflin' and lowdown . . .
Shug
No, celie. God not some gloomy old man like the pictures you've seen of him.
God not a man at all.
God is inside you and everyone else
That was or ever will be.
We come into this world with god.
But only them who look inside find it.
God is the flowers and everything else
That was or ever will be.
And when you feel the truth so real,
And when you love the way you feel, you've found it
Just as sure as moonlight bless the night.
Like a blade of corn,
Like a honeybee,
Like a waterfall,
All a part of me.
Like the color purple,
Where do it come from?
Open up your eyes,
Look what god has done.
Celie
You better be gettin' back. Your husband probably wonderin' where you are.
Shug
Where do you want to be, celie?
Celie
With you.
Shug
All right then.
Celie
God gon' take me to live with you?
Shug
Come on.

Me alone, you - no! Goddamn bats get out of my -! No! Stop! Get away from

Nobody to mess with me.
Nobody to push me around.
Nobody to tell me what to do.
Nobody to expect somethin' of me.
Nobody to tell me who i am
And who i ain't.
Nobody!
I got plenty to blame.
My daddy beat me,
For my own good, he say.
My first wife got kilt
When she run away.
My kids is all fools,
My crops is all dead,
Only woman i love
Won't lie in my bed.
A black man's life
Can't get any worse
'Less he wastin' away
Under miss celie's curse!
So tell me how a man do good
When all he know is bad?
Harpo happy.
What right he got to be happy?

How he keep findin'
So much good from so much bad?
His wife come back,
His business fine.
Everyone say
Harpo shine.
For all they been through,
They do just fine.
Nothin' i say
Change people mind about me.

Gon' be somethin' i do.

My nettie home.
Dear god, dear stars, dear trees, dear sky,
Dear peoples, dear everything, dear god,
God is inside me and everyone else
That was or ever will be.
I came into this world with god
And when i finally looked inside, i found it,
Just as close as my breath is to me.

When we
Share love.
Full company
Like a blade of corn,
Like a honeybee,
Like a waterfall,
All a part of me.
Like the color purple,
Where do it come from?
Now my eyes are open,
Look what god has done.
