Early Years Medley       
            Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah hut-hut
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah hut-hut

[TOMMY: 
That's our song. "Oh What A Night". "Ces soir?es-la". French. 
Number one in Paris, 2000. How'd that happen? You ask four guys, you get four different
versions. But this is where all of them start - Belleville, New Jersey. 
A thousand years ago. Eisenhower, Rocky Marciano, 
and a few guys under a street lamp singing somebody else's latest hit.]

Lost control and rang your bell
I was sore
Let me in or else I'll beat
Down your door
When two strangers who had been
Two silhouettes on the shade
Said to my shock,
"You're on the wrong block"

Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Wa-oh-oh-oh

Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Silhouettes (silhouettes)
Wa-oh-oh-oh

Darlin', my darlin', my darlin', my darlin', darlin'
Darlin', my darlin', my darlin', my darlin', darlin'

[TOMMY:
Our brass ring turns out to be a kid who sings like an angel. 
He hangs around the clubs. So I set up a little surprise for him.]

Bom-bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom-bom
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom

You're the apple of my ey-ey-eye

[TOMMY:
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen! We're the Variety Trio! 
Three, four-! And now, a new discovery of mine; little Frankie Castelluccio!]

I can't give you anything but love
Baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of
Baby
Dream awhile
Scheme awhile
We're sure to find
Happiness
And I guess
All those things you've always pined for
Gee, I'd like to see you looking swell
Baby

[TOMMY:
Groups are growing on trees, but this kid could do it for us. Sure, he's green, 
but that's where I come in. I take this raw clay and I make like Michaelangelo. 
I got a few years on him, so I've got a lot to teach him. It's like my mission.

Listen, Frankie, Tuesday night me and my brother Nick are going to knock 
over Fixer's Jewelry Store over on Frenchtown Road. Around midnight. You in, or what?

FRANKIE:
I dunno, my dad wants me home by eleven.

TOMMY:
Tell him we're rehearsing. I figure your cut will be a hundred and fifty. Maybe two.

He's a good kid. He just needs a little, you know, guidance.

MAN 1:
That jog your memory?

MAN 2:
Frankie, you're driving Tommy's car, 
you've got no license - it's one block from where they hit Fixer's!

MAN 1:
We got Tommy and his brother. They already gave you up, numbnuts.

FRANKIE:
I dunno what you're talking about.

MAN 1:
Have it your way.

JUDGE:
How old are you?

FRANKIE:
Sixteen, your honour.

JUDGE:
I'm letting you off with a warning. I suggest you get yourself a new set of friends. 
Now get out of here.

TOMMY:
Frankie - sing good.

JUDGE:
Kid's a singer?

TOMMY:
A good singer. And getting better.

JUDGE:
Then he ought to be great by the time you get out. Six months.]

Oh, earth angel 
Earth angel
The one I adore
Love you forever
And ever more

[GIRL:
Nicky, for God's sakes! What are we doing in church? 
I thought we were going to the movies!

NICK:
Relax, will you? The kid's ready to play a big room!]

I-I want a Sunday kind of love
A love to last past Saturday night
I'm glad to know 
It's more than love at first sight
I want a Sunday kind of love
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I do my Sunday dreaming
And all my Sunday scheming
Every minute
Every hour
Every day-ay-ay
I'm hoping to discover
A certain kind of lover

[MARY:
So that's your real name? Valli?

FRANKIE:
Nah - Castelluccio. Francis Castelluccio.

MARY:
Kind of long for a marquee. 

FRANKIE:
That's why I changed it. Vally. V-A-L-L-Y.

MARY:
No, V-A-L-L-I! 

FRANKIE:
How come?

MARY:
Because you're Italian! You've gotta end in a vowel. Delgad-O, Castellucci-O, pizz-A. 
Vall-I. With an I. It says, "This is who I am. You don't like it? You can go fuck yourself."

DECARLO:
Hey, Frankie - sing me "My Mother's Eyes".

FRANKIE:
Gee, Mr. DeCarlo. I haven't done that song since I was fifteen.

DECARLO:
Frankie, let me explain how this works. You do a favor for me - one day, I'll do a favor for you.

FRANKIE:
Sure, Mr. DeCarlo.]

One bright and guiding light
That taught me wrong from right
I found in my mother's eyes

Just like a wandering sparrow
One lo-o-onely soul
I walk the straight and narrow
To reach my goal

[TOMMY:
So it's me, Nick, and Frankie, and it's up to me to keep us out of the gutter. 
But nobody's hiring trios anymore. Quartets are in. So, I'm looking for a
fourth guy so we can get some work.

JOEY:
Tommy! I got your fourth guy! You're gonna thank me for this - he's a genius!

TOMMY:
What's his name?

JOEY: 
Guardio. Bob Guardio. He's a kid, but he plays like a madman. 
And he writes songs!]

Who wears short shorts?
(We wear short shorts)
They're such short shorts
(We like short shorts)
Who wears short shorts?
(We wear short shorts)

[JOEY:
Bobby! Bobby! Hey, listen! The Three Lovers - they got this kid singer - he's like, 
forget about it! And they're dying to meet you!

BOB:
Why?

JOEY:
Because I told them you're a fucking genius!]

There I go, there I go
There I go, there I go
Pretty baby, you are the soul 
Who snaps my control
Such a funny thing 
That every time I'm near you
I never can behave
You give me a smile 
And then I'm wrapped up in your magic

[BOB:
I dropped out of high school to tour with Short Shorts. 
I shared a bus with Chuck Berry, Sam Cooke, the Everly Brothers, Jackie Wilson... 
but I never heard a voice like Frankie Valli's. After eight bars, I know I need to write for this voice.] 

Brightest stars that shine up above you
In the clear blue skies
How I worry 'bout you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here
Don't have no fear
Is there a wonder why
I'm really feeling
I-in the-e moo-ood fo-or love

[TOMMY:
Nick Massi, Frankie Vallie; Bob- what is it? 

BOB:
Guardio. Hi.

NICK & FRANKIE:
Hi.

TOMMY:
Somebody said you write.

JOEY:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I told you! Can't we just borrow the piano for a minute? 
Go ahead, Bobby. Play the new one.]

December 1963 (Oh, What a Night)       
            Oh, what a night.
Late December back in '63.
What a very special time for me,
'Cause I remember what a night.

Oh, what a night.
You know, I didn't even know her name,
But I was never gonna be the same.
What a lady. What a night.

Oh, I. I got a funny feeling when she walked
In the room and I,
As I recall it ended much too soon.

Oh, what a night,
Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me.
She was everything I dreamed she'd be.
Sweet surrender, what a night!

I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinnin' my head around and taking my body under.
Oh, what a night!

Oh, I. I got a funny feeling when she walked
In the room and I,
As I recall it ended much too soon.

Oh, what a night.
Why'd it take so long to see the light?
Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right.
What a lady, what a night!

I felt a rush like a rolling bolt of thunder
Spinnin' my head around and taking my body under.
Oh, what a night!

My Eyes Adored You       
            My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you,
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you:
So close, so close and yet so far away

Carried your books from school,
Playing make-believe you're married to me:
You were fifth grade, I was sixth
When we came to be
Walking home every day over Barnegat Bridge and Bay,
Till we grew into the me and you
Who went our separate ways

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you,
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you:
So close, so close and yet so far

Headed for city lights,
Climbed the ladder up to fortune and fame,
I worked my fingers to the bone,
Made myself a name.
Funny, I seem to find that, no matter how the years unwind,
Still I reminisce about the girI miss
And the love I left behind...

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you,
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you:
So close, so close and yet so far

All my life I will remember how warm and tender
We were way back then
Though I'm feeling sad regrets I know I won't ever forget
You, my childhood friend

My eyes adored you
Though I never laid a hand on you,
My eyes adored you
Like a million miles away from me you couldn't see
How I adored you:
So close, so close and yet so far

Each day as I grow older,

Some day the sun will shine on me. 
Money, I don't have any: 
I'm down to my last penny, 
But, darling, don't cry over me:

I'll be a big man in town, just you wait and see: 
You'll be proud of me.

But my roving days are over. 
Someday your folks will welcome me. 
I went away a small man, 
But I'll come home a tall man. 
Then what a pretty bride you'll be.

Medley       
            (Stay, stay, stay)
Oh, just a little bit longer
(Stay, stay, stay)
Please, please, please, please, please
Tell me that you're gonna
(Stay, stay, stay)
Now your daddy don't mind
And your momma don't mind
If we have another dance here
Just one more
One more time
Oh won't you stay
(Stay, stay, stay)
Just a little bit longer
(Stay, stay, stay)
Please, please, please, please, please
Tell me that you're gonna

There ain't no good in our goodbye-ing
True love takes a lot of trying
Oh, I'm crying

Let's hang on
To what we've got
Don't let go girl
We've got a lot
Got a lot of love between us
Hang on, hang on, hang on
To what we've got
Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo

You say you're gonna go and call it quits
Gonna chuck it all and break our love to bits
(Breaking up)
I wish you'd never said it
(Breaking up)
No, no, we'll both regret it
Baby
(Don't you know)
Baby 
(Oh no, no)
Baby
(Think it over and stay-ay)

(Let's hang on)
Let's hang on
(To what we've got)
To what we've got
Don't let go girl
We've got a lot
Got a lot of love between us
Hang on, hang on, hang on
To what we've got
Doo doo, doo doo, doo doo

I can see
There ain't no room for me
You're only holding 
Out your heart in sympathy
If there's another man
Then girl I understand
Go on and take his hand
And don't you worry 'bout me

I'll be blue 
And I'll be crying too
But girl you know 
I only want what's best for you
What good is all my pride
If our true love has died
Go on and be his bride
And don't you worry 'bout me

I'll be strong
I'll try to carry on
Although you know 
It won't be easy when you're gone
I'll always think of you
The tender love we knew
But somehow I'll get through
So don't you worry 'bout me

Bye bye baby, baby goodbye
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)
Bye bye baby, don't make me cry
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)

You're the one girl in town not married
Girl, I'd marry you now if I were free
I wish it could be-e-e-e
I could love you but why begin it
'Cause there ain't any future in it
She's got me and I'm not free

So bye bye baby, goodbye
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)
Bye bye baby, don't make me cry
(Bye baby, baby bye bye)
Bye baby, bye
Why make me cry?
Bye baby, baby bye bye

Ahh

Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You       
            You're just too good to be true 
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
So if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

I love you baby and if it's quite all right
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights
I love you baby, trust in me when I say
Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down I pray

Oh pretty baby, now that I've found you stay
And let me love you baby, let me love you

You're just too good to be true 
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

Working My Way Back To You       
            Working my way back to you babe
With a burning love inside
Yeah, I'm workin my way back to you, babe
And the happiness that died
I let it get away, paying every day

When you were so in love with me
I played around like I was free
Thought I could have my cake and eat it too
Oh how I cried over losing you

For every day I made you cry
I'm paying girl til the day that I die
I'll keep working my way back to you babe
With a burning love inside
I'm working my way back to you babe
With a happiness that died
I let it get away, payin every day

I used to love to make you cry
It made me feel like a man inside
But if I'd been a man in reality
You'd still be here babe lovin me

Now the nights are long and lonely
And I'm not too strong babe I just miss you so
And you're too proud, won't give in
But when I think about all I could win

I keep working my way back to you babe
With a burning love inside
I'm working my way back to you babe
With a happiness that died
I let it get away, payin every day

yeah yeah yeah

Working my way back to you babe
With a burning love inside
I'm working my way back to you babe
WIth a happiness that died oh how I'm cryin
Working my way back to you babe
With a burning love inside

Fallen Angel       
            Frankie:
You're home again,
Glad you kept the key
Been waitin' here
seems a million years to me,
but, hush now,
I know you're all cried out
It's alright
inside I've had no doubt about
your love for me
I can see behind the tears
I certain of the way we feel 
and given time the hurt will heal

You're home again, 
so won't you close the door
stay here with me, 
and we'll forget what's gone before
just hold on tight
our love is gonna make it if I
put shadows way beyond recall
The ghost has almost gone

Fallen Angel
I'll forgive you anything 
you can't help the things you do
now, something's gotten hold of you
Fallen Angel
Got a demon in your soul
And later when the fever's gone
I'll be here where you belong.

Crewe:
[Spoken]
It's been more than 20 years
since these guys were on the same stage together
and what better stage for a reunion 
than the one right here at the Rock-n-Roll hall of fame.
Ladies and gentlemen, My old friends and brand new Hall-of-Famers,
the original Four Seasons.

She's a rag doll, such a rag doll
