Pierre       
            PIERRE
It's dawned on me suddenly
And for no obvious reason
That I can't go on
Living as I am

The zest of life has vanished 
Only the skeleton remains
Unexpectedly vile
I used to be better

CHORUS
O Pierre! Our merry feasting crank
Our most dear, most kind, most smart and eccentric 
A warm-hearted Russian of the old school
His purse is always empty 
Cuz it's open to all
O Pierre
Just one of a hundred sad old men
Living out their final days in Moscow

PIERRE
I drank too much
Right now, my friend fights and bleeds
And I sit at home and read
Hours at a time
Hours at my screen
Anything, anything
Abandoned to distraction
In order to forget
We waste our lives
Drowning in wine

I never thought that I'd end up like this
I used to better

And the women they all pity me
Cuz I'm married
But not in love
Frozen at the center

WOMEN
Il est charmant; il n'a pas de sexe
He is charming; he has no sex

CHORUS
O Pierre! Our merry feasting crank
Our most dear, most kind, most smart and eccentric 
A warm-hearted Russian of the old school
His purse is always empty
Cuz it's open to all
O Pierre
Just one of a hundred sad old men
Living out their final days in Moscow

PIERRE
There's a ringing in my head
There's a sickness in the world
And everyone knows
But pretends that they don't see
?Oh, I'll sort it out later?
But later never comes

PIERRE & MEN
And how many men before
Good Russian men
Believing in goodness and truth

PIERRE
Entered that door
With all their teeth and hair
And left it toothless and bald

You empty and stupid
Contented fellows
Satisfied with your place
I'm different from you
I'm different from you
I still want to do something

Or do you struggle too?
I pity you, I pity me, I pity you
I pity you, I pity me, I pity you

CHORUS
Ah...

You must call me Sonya

MARYA D.
Welcome
Welcome to Moscow
Where faded and fading princesses live
I'll take you where you must go
Pet you a bit
And I'll scold you a bit
My goddaughter, my favorite, Natasha
I will touch you on the cheek

NATASHA & SONYA
My cousin and I
Are so pleased to be with you
While we wait on our fiancees 
Fighting in the war 

MARYA D.
Bright in their things!
What are you dawdling for?
Get the samovar ready!
Bring some rum for the tea!
Sonyushka bonjour
And Natasha my darling
You've grown plumper and prettier

NATASHA
My cheeks are glowing from the cold

SONYA
She said
Gazing at Marya with kind, glittering eyes

MARYA D.
Welcome
Welcome to Moscow
Scruffy and cozy
Like an old dressing gown

NATASHA
Sofia Alexandrovna

SONYA
How beautiful you looked in the snow

NATASHA
Cousin dear I love you
Trust no one but you
But I can't bear this waiting
I cry and I cry
Audrey where are you?
I want him now, at once
To embrace him and cling to him
No one can understand

I love him
I know him
He loves me only
He'll come home one day
And take me away
I want nothing more
I want nothing more

Hmmm...

MARYA D.
First thing tomorrow to Madame Chambord's
Dresses, dresses, we'll buy what we can afford
Then dinner and a game of Boston
Then you'll read to me while I knit!
How wonderful to have you here
Instead of these gossips and crybabies

NATASHA & SONYA
You'll take us where we must go
Pet us a bit
And scold us a bit

SONYA
Her goddaughter, her favorite, Natasha
She will touch you on the cheek

(Sonya leaves)

MARYA D.
Well, now we'll talk
I congratulate you and Audrey
You've hooked a fine fellow!
One of the finest matches in all of Russia
I am glad and relieved, 
He'll be the family's saving grace

NATASHA
I blush happily

MARYA D.
But his father, Prince Bolkonsky, much dislikes his son's marrying
The old fellow's crotchety!
Of course Prince Andrey's not a child
But it's not nice to enter a family against a father's will
One wants to do it peacefully and lovingly
But you're a clever girl
Just be kind to Andrey's sister
And when the sister loves you,
So will the father
And all will be well

The Private and Intimate Life of the House       
            BOLKONSKY
I've aged
I've aged so very much
I fall asleep at the table
My napkin drops to the floor

I'm full of childish vanities
I forget things
And I love in the past
I've aged so very much

People enjoy me though
I come in for tea in my old-fashioned coat and powered wig
And I tell stories
And utter scathing critiques 

This old-fashioned house
With its gigantic mirrors and powered footmen
And this stern, shrewd old man
A relic of the past century
With his gentle daughter
Is a majestic and agreeable spectacle

MARY
But besides the couple hours during which we have guests
There are also twenty-two hours in the day
During which the private and intimate life of the house continues 

BOLKONSKY
Bring me my slippers

MARY
Yes father yes father

BOLKONSKY
Bring me my wine

MARY
Yes father yes father
Oh father

And I never go anywhere
Never invited
For who would take care of him
Who would take care

MARY & BOLKONSKY
And I have no friends
No no no

BOLKONSKY
Girl, all my friends are dead

MARY
No one

BOLKONSKY
All my friends are dead

MARY
Time is moving
It's now or never
My fate is slipping past me

BOLKONSKY
Silence! Silence!

MARY
Yes father yes father

BOLKONSKY
Shut your damn mouth girl
Shut your damn mouth
I can hurt you

MARY & BOLKONSKY
I can hurt you

MARY
But I never ever ever ever would
This is just how it is
It's just how he is
I'm always to blame

He could beat me
Or treat me like a dog
Make me fetch wood or water
And that's just how it is
Oh father
I love you father

Time is moving
It's now or never
I've abandoned the hope of getting married

BOLKONSKY
Ah! What's this, a young suitor?
Ah, come in come in

But don't sit down
Don't sit down
I'm cold to you
Yes I'm mean to you
Now be gone be gone be gone
And don't come back!

Maybe I'll marry someone myself
Some cheap French thing
Oh that offends you does it?
Ah, come in my dear, come in my dear, come in

MARY
And he draws her to him
And he kisses her hand 
Embraces her affectionately 
And I flush and run out of the room

BOLKONSKY
Come back here
Let an old man have his fun
Wipe away your tears girl
I don't want your tears

MARY
On that horrible woman
Vile and inhuman
She's using you, Papa
Wants your money Papa
To take advantage of your weakness like that
It's disgusting
My voice breaks

BOLKONSKY
It's my money
And I'll throw it where I want
Not at you!
And not at Andrey's harlot!
It's my money, my money, 
Mine all mine!

Insolent girl!
Insolent girl!
Where-
Where-

Where are my glasses?
Where are, where are they?
Where are my glasses?
Where are-
Where-

Oh God-
Oh God I'm frightened
Oh God I've-
I've aged, I've aged so very much
Oh God I'm frightened
Where-
Where are my glasses?
Where are my, where are my-
Where are my glasses?

MARY
There are there upon his head
They are there upon his head
The pride of sacrifice 
Gathers in my soul
They are there upon his head

And he forgets things
He lives in the past
He falls asleep at the table
His napkin drops to the floor
His shaking head
Sinks over his plate

He is old and feeble
And I dare to judge him
I disgust myself
I disgust myself

Natasha & Bolkonskys       
            NATASHA
I know they'll like me
They can't help but like me
Everyone has always like me
His father, my Andrey's father
His sister, my Andrey's sister
There in no reason for them not to like me

Are the Prince and Princess at home?

SERVANT
The Prince in not receiving,
But the Princess begs you to walk up

MARY
Oh
Oh, hello
Won't you come in

NATASHA
Hello

(Natasha and Mary awkwardly move to a table in silence)

MARY
And from the first glance I do not like Natasha
Too fashionably dressed
Frivolous and vain
Her beauty, youth, and happiness
My brother's love for her

And my father -

BOLKONSKY
I do not wish to see her!

MARY
I know at any moment he might indulge in some freak

NATASHA
I'm sorry the Price is still ailing

BOLKONSKY
Songstress!

NATASHA
I am not afraid of anyone

But such hesitation
Such unnatural manners

And from the first glance I do not like Princess Mary
Too plain and affected
Insolent and dry
I shrink into myself
Assume an offhand air

MARY
Which alienates me still more

NATASHA & MARY
Constrained and strained
Constrained and strained
Constrained and strained
Irksome
Irksome

(The Prince enters in his dressing gown)

BOLKONSKY
Ah! Ah Madam!
Countess Rostova, if I am not mistaken-
Oh! Oh I beg you to excuse me, excuse me, my costume, this dressing gown-
I did not know, my poor girl
God is my witness, I did not know you had honored us with a visit
I came in such a costume only to see my daughter
God is my witness, I didn't know
My poor girl

MARY
And he looked at her once
Head to toe
And left muttering

NATASHA
I must take my leave

MARY
Please wait -

Dear Natalie
I want you to know how glad I am my brother has found happiness

NATASHA
Is that the truth?
I think it is not convenient to speak of that now
Dear Princess

MARY
She said
With such dignity and coldness

NATASHA
Though I felt tears choking me

What have I said, what have I done?
Crying like a child
Oh, they were so awful!
Oh, it all hurts so terribly
Andrey
Where are you?

No One Else       
            NATASHA
The moon -
First time I heard your voice
Moonlight burst into the room
And I saw your eyes
And I saw your smile 
And the world opened wide 
And the world was inside of me 

And I catch my breath
And I laugh and blush 
And I hear guitars
You are so good for me

I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you

Oh the moon
Oh the snow in the moonlight
And your childlike eyes
And your distant smile
I'll never be this happy again 
You and I
And no one else

We've done this all before
We were angels once
Don't you remember?
Joy and life
Inside our souls
And nobody knows
Just you and me
It's our secret

This winter sky
How can anyone sleep?
There was never such a night before!
I feel like putting my arms round my knees
And squeezing tight as possible
And flying away
Like this...

Oh the moon
Oh the snow in the moonlight
And your childlike eyes
And your distant smile
I'll never be this happy again
You and I
You and I
You and I
And no one else

Maybe he'll come today
Maybe he came already
And he's sitting in the drawing room
And I simply forgot

Opera       
            MARYA D.
The opera, the opera!
Hold up your dresses and jump out quickly

SERVANT 
Ladies
Welcome to the opera

SONYA
Bare arms and shoulders
Brilliant uniforms
Pearls and silk
Glittering before our eyes
Feminine envy
A whole crowd of memories
Desires and emotions
Natasha, smooth your gown

CHORUS
Natasha, smooth your gown

NATASHA
Looking in the glass
I see I am pretty
Not a girl anymore
I've never felt like this before

Hundreds of eyes 
Looking at my bare arms
My bare arms and neck
My bare arms and shoulders

CHORUS
The two remarkably pretty girls
Had not been seen in Moscow in many years
Everybody knew vaguely of Natasha's engagement
One of the finest matches in all of Russia 

SONYA 
Look, there's Alexey, home from the war at last

MARYA D.
He has changed
Dear me, Michael Kirilovich has grown still stouter!

CHORUS 
There's Boris and Julie, engaged
And Anna Mikhaylovna, what a headdress she has on!

HELENE
And is that Natasha

CHORUS
And is that Natasha
And is that Natasha

NATASHA
They are looking at me
They are talking about me!
They all like me so much
The women envious 
The men calming their jealousy 

SERVANT 
Announcing Fedya Dolokhov
He dominates Moscow's most brilliant young men
He stands in full view
Well aware he's attracting attention 
Yet as much as ease as though he were in his own room

MARYA D.
Dolokhov was in the Caucasus
And he killed the Shah's brother!
Now all the Moscow ladies are mad about him
Dolokhov the assassin!

SERVANT
Announcing Countess Helene Bezukhova
The queen of society
Beautiful, barely clothed
Plump bare shoulders, and much exposed neck 
Round which she wears a double string of pearls

CHORUS 
Helene and Dolokhov, arm in arm
Pierre the cuckold sits at home
Pierre the cuckold sits at home
The poor man

PIERRE
No, I am enjoying myself at home this evening

NATASHA
Oh, that neck
Oh, those pearls

HELENE
So beautiful
What a charming young girl
So enchanting

NATASHA
I blush scarlet

MARYA D.
Countess Bezukhova, Pierre's wife
Have you been here long?
And where is dear Pierre?
He never used to forget us

NATASHA
Yes Pierre, that good man
A little sad, a little stout
He must come visit us

HELENE
I will implore

MARYA D.
There's a woman one should stay far away from

Now Natasha
The curtain rises

CHORUS
The curtain rises

NATASHA
Everyone in the boxes and the stalls became silent
All the men, old and young, in uniform and evening dress
All the women in the hall
With gems on their bare flesh
Turned their whole attention
With curiosity to the stage

(Two singers perform a scene from an avant-garde opera. It is grotesque and amazing.)

NATASHA
Grotesque and amazing
I cannot follow the opera
Or even listen to the music
I see painted cardboard
Queerly dressed actors
Moving and singing so strangely in the lights
So false and unnatural
I'm ashamed and amused
And everyone else seems oblivious
Yes everyone feigns delight

SONYA
And feeling the flood of brilliant lights, 
The warm perfumed air heated by the crowd,
Natasha little by little
Began to pass into a state of intoxication

(Natasha joins the singers in the opera.)

NATASHA
Oh I'd tickle you all if I could
Oh I'd tickle you all if I could

SONYA
And then
A rush of cold air

NATASHA & SONYA
An exceptionally handsome man walked in
With a confident yet courteous air

HELENE 
This was Helene's brother
Anatole Kuragin
He moved with a swagger
Which would have been ridiculous
Had he not been so good-looking
And though it was the middle of the act
He walked right down the aisle
His sword and spurs jangling
His handsome perfumed head held high
And he looked right at Natasha

ANATOLE 
Mais Charmante 

HELENE
And he took his place in the front row next to Dolokhov

NATASHA
How handsome he is
How intoxicating

SONYA
In the second act there were tombstones
The moon over the footlights
Horns and contrabass
Black cloaks and daggers in their hands

NATASHA
I turn around again and our eyes meet
He gazes straight into my eyes
He is talking about me

SONYA
Candles burning
A crimson throne
The Tsar wails a mournful tune
They all wave their arms
And everybody cheers
?Bravo, bravo!?

NATASHA
Everytime I look at him
He's looking at me
Everytime I look at him
He's looking at me
Everytime I look at him

SONYA
A terrible noise, a clutter in the crowd
A storm of chromatic scales and diminished sevenths
With rapturous faces everyone was shouting
Screaming and shouting, ?Bravo!?

CHORUS
Bravo, bravo
Bravo, bravo
Bravo, bravo

SONYA
And then
A rush of cole air
And Anatole entered the box

            ANATOLE
I have long wished to have this happiness
Ever since the Naryshkins' ball
Where I had the well-remembered pleasure of seeing you
How do you like the performance?
Last week Semenova fell down on the stage

NATASHA
He is sensible and simple
Bold and natural,
So strange and agreeable
There is nothing formidable 
His smile is most naÃ¯ve,
Cheerful and good-natured
And he's as handsome up close as at a distance
And he's as handsome up close as at a distance

ANATOLE
And do you know, Natasha
We are having a costume tournament soon
You ought to come, please come!

NATASHA
Oh - 

ANATOLE
You ought to come, please come!

NATASHA
Oh I - 

ANATOLE
And I never remove my smiling eyes
From your face, your neck, your bare arms
And I never remove my smiling eyes
From your face, your neck, your bare arms

NATASHA
I know for certain that he is taken by me
I know for certain that he is enraptured by me
I feel him looking at my shoulders
My face, my neck, my bare arms

ANATOLE
And I look you in the eye

NATASHA & ANATOLE
And I look you in the eye

NATASHA
And looking into his eyes
I am frightened
There's not that barrier of modesty 
I've always felt with men
I feel so terribly near
I fear that he may seize me from behind
And kiss me on the neck

How do you like Moscow?

ANATOLE
At first I did not like it much
Because what makes a town pleasant
Ce sont les jolies femmes
Isn't that so?
But now I like it very much indeed
Do come to the costume tournament Countess,
Do come!
You will be the prettiest there
You will be the prettiest there
Do come, dear Countess, and give me this flower as a pledge

We are speaking of most ordinary things

NATASHA
Yet I feel closer to you than I've ever felt with any other man
No one else is here
No one else can see us
Your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes
Oh your eyes

ANATOLE
It's all right, Natasha, I'm here
It's all right, Natasha, I'm here

NATASHA
And I -
I cannot speak

NATASHA & ANATOLE
Look straight into my eyes
Nearness
Tenderness
Smile at me
Gaze straight into my eyes
There is no barrier between us
There is nothing between us
Nothing between us

Natasha Lost       
            NATASHA
I smile, I shake
And the opera continues
And I'm quite submissive to the world I am in
My previous life is slipping away from me
My distant past is gone, is gone

And the rest of the night
I can't take my eyes from him
His glittering eyes
And his tender smile

And as I am leaving
Flushed and nervous
He touches my arm
And I turn around
And he's looking at me
With his glittering eyes
And his tender smile

O God! I am lost!
How could I let him?
Everything is dark, obscure, and terrible
I don't understand this
O God! I am lost!

Back in the theater, full of lights
Where tenors jumped about in tinsel jackets
Young girls and old men cried ?bravo!? in repture
There it all seemed simple
But now, alone
I am tortured

My conscience gnaws away at my heart
Am I spoiled for Andrey's love or not?
Oh I can soothe myself with irony:
Nothing! It was nothing
I didn't lead him on at all
No one will ever know
I'll never see him again
Nothing has happened
And Andrey can love me still
O God, why isn't he here?

And yet it was like there was nothing between us
No veil, no modesty
Just his face and strong hands
His glittering eyes
And his tender smile
That bold handsome man who pressed my arm

ANATOLE
Yes, charming
Look, Dolokhov's coming round and we are off to the Club
Will you come old man?

PIERRE
I will come

ANATOLE
Lend me fifty rubles?

(Dolokhov arrives with many bottles of vodka)

DOLOKHOV
Drink drink
Gonna drink tonight
Gonna drink tonight
Gonna drink
Gonna drink
Gonna drink tonight
Gonna drink tonight
Gonna drink tonight
Gonna

DOLOKHOV, ANATOLE & PIERRE
Drink drink
Gonna drink tonight
Gonna drink tonight
Gonna
Gonna drink
Gonna drink tonight
Gonna drink tonight
Gonna drink tonight

(They drink and dance)

ALL
Drink with me my love
For there's fire in the sky
And there's ice on the ground
Either way my soul will die
Whoa....

PIERRE
The doctors warn me
That with my corpulence
Vodka and wine are dangerous for me

But I drink a great deal
Only quite at ease
After pouring several glasses
Mechanically into my large mouth

ALL
Then I feel
A pleasant warmth in my body,
A sentimental attachment to my fellow men

(Helene arrives and sidles up to Dolokhov.)

HELENE
Keep drinking old man

ANATOLE & DOLOKHOV
Keep drinking old man

HELENE, ANATOLE & DOLOKHOV
Drink the whole night through
Keep drinking old man

ALL
Keep drinking old man
Drink the whole night through
Keep drinking old man

(Pierre continues to drink, too much)

DOLOKHOV
Now Anatole,
What women tonight?
Moscow ladies
Or gypsy girls?
French actresses?

ANATOLE
Just no more unmarried heiresses!
So plain and boring

DOLOKHOV
And a little too dangerous eh?
Anatole is a married man
A fact known only to his intimates
A Polish landowner of some small means
Had forced him to marry his daughter

ANATOLE
Nevermind about that now, 
It doesn't matter, I don't give a damn
Just as a duck is made to swim in water
God has made me as I am
All I care for is gaiety and women
And there's no dishonor in that
As long as there's money and vodka
I'll keep a feather in my hat

ALL
Whoa....

PIERRE
I used to love
I used to love
I used to be better

CHORUS
Keep drinking old man

HELENE
Yes drink drink drink
Drink drink drink
God, to think I married a man like you

PIERRE
Don't speak to me, wife
There is something inside me

HELENE
Dolokhov pour me another

PIERRE
Something terrible and monstrous 

DOLOKHOV
Here's to the health of married women!
And a smile lurks at the corner of my mouth
Here's to the health of married women, and their lovers!

DOLOKHOV & CHORUS
Here's to the health of married women!
Here's to the health of married women, and their lovers!
Here's to the health of married women!
Here's to the health of married women, and their lovers!

PIERRE
How dare you touch her?

DOLOKHOV
You can't love her

PIERRE
Enough! 
You bully, you scoundrel!
I challenge you!

DOLOKHOV
Oh, a duel!
Yes, this is what I like

HELENE
He will kill you! 
Stupid husband!

PIERRE
So I shall be killed!
What is it to you!
Anatole, my guns

ANATOLE
Oh! This is horribly stupid

PIERRE
Just show me where to go
And tell me when to shoot

ANATOLE
Just wait till you're close enough
You'll never hit him from forty paces

DOLOKHOV
Well, let's begin!
This is child's play

SERVANT (DENISOV)
As the adversaries have refused a reconciliation, we shall please proceed with the duel
Ready your pistols, and on the count of tri, begin to advance

ALL
Rahz! Dva! Tri!

(They start towards each other.)

ANATOLE
Pierre, hold your fire
Pierre, hold your fire
Pierre, not yet!

(Pierre fires early; Dolokhov is hit)

DOLOKHOV
No!...
My turn

PIERRE
My turn

ANATOLE
Pierre, stand back!

(Pierre walks toward Dolokhov with his chest exposed. Dolokhov fires.)

DOLOKHOV
Missed
Missed
Oh my mother, my angel,
My adored angel mother!

HELENE
Take him away

(Anatole carries Dolokhov out.)

PIERRE
Missed
Missed
Such a storm of feelings

HELENE
You are a fool

(Pierre leaves. Anatole returns.)

ANATOLE
Natasha, Natasha
Her arms, her shoulders
Her neck, her feet

HELENE
The air of connoisseur

ANATOLE
I will make love to her

HELENE
And what will come of it?
She's first-rate, my dear, but she's not for you
You'd better wait till she's married

ANATOLE
You know, I adore little girls,
They lose their heads at once

Ask her to dinner, eh?
Sweet sister

Sunday Morning       
            NATASHA
Has Andrey arrived?
Has Andrey arrived?
He has not arrived
He will never come
Or something will happen to me before he does

MARYA D.
Come to church dear

SONYA
Marya Dmitryevna likes Sundays and knows how to keep them
The whole house has been scrubbed and cleaned
Roast goose and suckling pig filled our noses with glee
We wear holiday dresses
Travel by troika to church

MARYA D.
God is everywhere

NATASHA
I suffer more now than before
The theater and Anatole
That man who aroused such terrible feelings
I don't understand
Have I broken faith with Andrey? 
Am I guilty?

SONYA
After church, Marya left for Prince Bolkonsky's

MARYA D.
The rudeness of that man!
I'll straighten him out!

NATASHA
That terrible old Prince

SONYA
There, there Natasha
It's not your fault
Here, kiss me

NATASHA
I can't bear to think of it
I'll shut myself in my room
And try on new dresses

SONYA
And just after Marya left
There was a knock at the door
Natasha had just turned her head to the glass
When she heard a voice that made her flush

Charming       
            HELENE ?
Oh my enchantress ?
Oh you beautiful thing 
Charming, charming 
Oh, this is really beyond anything ?
These dresses suit you ?
This one, ?metallic gauze? 
Straight from Paris 
Anything suits you, my charmer
Oh how she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!
Oh how she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!

You are such a lovely thing
??Oh where have you been ?
It?s such a shame to bury pearls in the country 
Charmante, charmante, charming

Now if you have a dress 
You must wear it out ?
How can you live in Moscow and not go nowhere?
So you love somebody, charming 
But that?s no reason to shut yourself in ?
Even if you?re engaged 
You must wear your dress out somewhere

My brother dined with me yesterday 
But he didn?t eat a thing ?
Cuz he was thinking ?bout you 
He kept sighing ?bout you?
?
Oh how she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!
Oh how she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!
Charmante, charmante! 
You are such a lovely thing??
Oh where have you been ?
It?s such a shame to bury pearls in the country 
Charmante, charmante, charming

Now a woman with a dress??
Is a frightening and powerful thing ?
You are not a child 
When you?re draped in scarlet and lace ?
Your fiancÃ© would want you to have fun 
Rather than be bored to death??Alliez dans la monde 
PlutÃ´t que de dÃ©pÃ©rir d?ennui!

My brother is quite madly in love 
He is quite madly in love with you, my dear

Oh how she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty! ?
Oh how she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty! ?
Charmante, charmante!

It?s such a shame to bury pearls in the country 
Charmante, charmante, charming

NATASHA
What once seemed so terrible
Now seems simple and natural
She knows I'm engaged
And still she talks so frankly
So it must be all right!

HELENE
There is a ball at my house tonight
You must come
Oh your wide-open, wondering eyes!
You will be the prettiest there!
How the thought of throwing them together amuses me!
You must come

NATASHA
I will come

The Ball       
            ANATOLE
Waiting at the door
Waiting at the door
Waiting

Waiting at the door
Waiting at the door
Waiting

Waiting at the door
Waiting at the door
Waiting
And there she is

(The ball begins; they dance)

NATASHA
I am seized by feelings of vanity and fear
There is no barrier between us
Whispers and moans and ringing in my ear
There is no barrier between us
Divine, delicious
But I do not see or hear anything
I'm borne away to a senseless world
So strange, so remote
I don't know good from bad
Anatole
Anatole
I'm so frightened

ANATOLE
You are enchanting

NATASHA
And as we danced he pressed my waist and hand 
And told me I was 

NATASHA & ANATOLE
Bewitching

ANATOLE
And I love you

NATASHA & ANATOLE
Bewitching

ANATOLE
And I love you

NATASHA
And during the ecossaise, he

NATASHA & ANATOLE
Gazed in my eyes

NATASHA
My frightened eyes

Such confident tenderness 
I could not say what I had to say

ANATOLE
Don't lower your eyes
I love you
I am in love dear
I am in love

Gaze in my eyes
I love you
You are bewitching
What can I do
Darling what can I do

NATASHA
Don't say such things
I am betrothed
I love another

ANATOLE
Don't speak to me of that!
When I tell you I am madly, madly, in love with you!
Is it my fault that you're enchanting?

NATASHA
I'm so frightened
I don't understand anything tonight

ANATOLE
I'm here now

(Natasha breaks away)

ANATOLE
Natalie!

NATASHA
I can feel your eyes upon me

ANATOLE
Blocking her path, I bring her face close to mine

NATASHA
His large, glittering, masculine eyes are so close to mine
That I see nothing else

ANATOLE
Is it possible that I should never see you again?
I love you madly!
Can I never?
Natalie?

NATASHA
You press my arm
You press my arm

ANATOLE
Natalie?

NATASHA
You're hurting my hands

ANATOLE
Natalie?

NATASHA
I don't understand
I have nothing to say

(They kiss)

NATASHA
Burning lips press to mine
Tell me what just happened

I'm trembling
So frightened

Andrey

But I love you
Of that there is no doubt
How else could all of this have happened?
How else could we have kissed?
It means that I have loved you from the first 
It means that you are kind, noble, and splendid
And I could not help loving you

I will love you Anatole
I'll do anything for you

NATASHA & ANATOLE
I'll do anything for you

Letters       
            ALL
In nineteenth century Russia we write letters
We write letters
We put down in writing 
What is happening in our minds

Once it's on the paper we feel better
We feel better
It's like some kind of clarity
When the letter's done and signed

PIERRE
Dear Andrey
Dear old friend
How goes the war?
Do we march on the French splendidly?
Do our cannons crack and cry?
Do our bullets whistle and sing?
Does the air reek with smoke?
I wish I were there
With death at my heels

Dolokhov is recovering
He will be all right, the good man
It should have been me
I am a most ridiculous man

And Natasha is in town
I hear she is more beautiful than ever 
How I envy you and your happiness 

Here at home
I drink and read and drink and read and drink
And I fill my mind with rot
While my heart is empty
And I've been studying the Cabal
And I've calculated the number of the beast
It is Napoleon
I will kill him one day
He is not a great man
None of us are great men
We are just caught in the wave of history
Nothing matters
Everything matters
It's all the same
If only I could not see it,
This dreadful, terrible it

ALL 
In nineteenth century Russia we write letters
We write letters
We put down in writing
What is happening in our minds

NATASHA
Dear Andrey -

What more can I write
After all that has happened?
What am I to do if I love him and the other one too?
Must I break it off?
These terrible questions

NATASHA & PIERRE
I see nothing but the candle in the mirror 
No visions of the future
So lost and alone

NATASHA
And what of Princess Mary

MARY
Dear Natasha
I am in deep despair at the misunderstanding there is between us
Whatever my father's feelings might be
I beg you to believe that I cannot help loving you
He's a tired old man and must be forgiven
Please, come see us again

NATASHA
Dear Princess Mary -

Oh what am I to write!
How do I choose
What do I do
I shall never be happy again

PIERRE
These terrible questions

MARY 
I'm so alone here

NATASHA & PIERRE
So alone in here

MARY
And I see nothing

NATASHA, PIERRE & MARY
I see nothing but the candle in the mirror
No visions of the future
So lost and alone

ALL
In nineteenth century Russia we write letters
We write letters
We put down in writing
What is happening in our minds

ANATOLE
Dear Natalie
A love letter
A love letter
A love letter

NATASHA
A letter from him, from the man that I love

DOLOKHOV
A letter which I composed

ALL
A love letter
A love letter...

ANATOLE
Natalie Natalie Natalie
I must love you or die
Natalie Natalie Natalie
If you love me say yes
And I will come and steal you away
Steal you out of the dark
Natalie Natalie Natalie
I want nothing more

Natalie Natalie Natalie 
I must love you or die
Natalie Natalie Natalie 
If you love me say yes
And I will come and steal you away
Steal you out of the dark
Natalie Natalie Natalie
I want nothing more

Just say yes
Just say yes
Just say yes

NATASHA
Yes, yes, I love him!
How else could I have his letter in my hand?
I read it twenty times
Thirty times, forty times!
Each and every word
I love him, I love him

(Natasha sleeps. Sonya arrives and reads Anatole's letter.)
Last Update: June, 10th 2013

Sonya & Natasha       
            SONYA
How was it I noticed nothing?
How could it go so far?
It can't be that she loves him
It can't be
Natasha

(Natasha awakes and sees Sonya)

NATASHA
Sonya, you're back
And with the tender resolve that often comes at the moment of awakening
I embraced my friend
But noticing Sonya's look of embarrassment
My face expressed confusion 
And suspicion

Sonya, you've read the letter?

SONYA
Yes

NATASHA
Oh Sonya, I'm glad,
I can't hide it any longer!
Now you know, we love one another!
Oh Sonya, he writes, he writes
He writes, he writes, he writes

SONYA 
And Andrey?

NATASHA
Oh Sonya, if you only knew how happy I am!
You don't know what love is

SONYA
But Natasha, can that all be over?

NATASHA
I do not grasp the question

SONYA
Are you refusing Prince Andrey?

NATASHA
Oh, you don't understand anything!
Don't talk nonsense, just listen

SONYA
But I can't believe it, I don't understand
How you loved one man a whole year
And suddenly -
You've only known him three days!
Natasha, you're joking!

NATASHA
Three days?
It seems to me I've loved him a hundred years
It seems to me that I've never loved anyone before
Sonya, wait a bit, sit here

I had heard that it happens like this
And you must have heard it too
But it's only now
That I feel such love
It's not the same as before
He's my master and I am his slave
What can I do?
Sonya, what can I do?
I'm so happy
And so frightened
Why can't you understand?
I love him!

SONYA
Then I won't let it come to that, I shall tell!
Bursting into tears

NATASHA
What do you mean?
For God's sake, if you tell, you are my enemy!
You want me to be miserable 
You want to tear us apart
For God's sake, Sonya, don't tell anyone, don't torture me
I have confided in you

SONYA
What has happened between you?
What has he said to you?
Why doesn't he come to the house and openly ask for you hand?
Why this secrecy? 
Have you thought what his secret reasons may be?

NATASHA
I don't know what the reasons are
But there must be reasons!
Sonya, one can't doubt him!
One can't, one can't! Don't you understand?

SONYA
Does he love you?

NATASHA
Does he love me?
Why, you've read his letter, you've seen him
I can't live without him

SONYA
Natasha, think of our family
And think of Prince Andrey

NATASHA
Andrey said I was free to refuse him

SONYA
But you haven't refused him, or have you?

NATASHA
Perhaps I have
Perhaps all is over between me and Bolkonsky 
Would you think so badly of me?

SONYA
I won't succumb to your tender tone Natasha 
I don't trust him, Natasha!
I'm afraid for you, Natasha!
Afraid you are going to your ruin

NATASHA
Then I'll go to my ruin, yes I will, as soon as possible!
But it's not your business!
It won't be you, it'll be me, who'll suffer
Leave me alone, yes leave me alone!
I hate you Sonya!
I hate you Sonya!
I hate you, I hate you!
You're my enemy forever!

SONYA
I burst into sobs

(Natasha runs out of the room)

NATASHA
And without a moment's reflection 
I wrote the answer to Princess Mary
I'd been unable to write all morning

All our misunderstandings are at an end
Forget everything and forgive me
But I can't be Andrey's wife

Sonya Alone       
            SONYA
Hard as it is 
In the coming days 
I watch my friend 
in her strange unnatural state ?
Don?t let her out of my sight ?
She trails off 
Stares at nothing 
Laughs at random 
and the letters come

?She waits at the window 
And I listen at the door

Until one day 
I see by the sad look on her face ?
That there is a dreadful plan in her heart

I know you are capable of anything 
I know you so well my friend ?
I know you might just run away 
What am I to do???Who do I ask for help? 
Is it all on me? 
Is it all on me?

I will stand in the dark for you ?
I will hold you back by force ?
I will stand here right outside your door ?
I won?t see you disgraced ?
I will protect your name and your heart ?
Because I miss my friend

I know you?ve forgotten me ?
I know you so well my friend ?
I know you might just throw yourself over ?
But I won?t let you 
I won?t let you 
It?s all on me

I remember this family 
I remember your kindness 
And if I never sleep again??I will stand in the dark for you ?
I will hold you back by force ?
I will stand here right outside your door 
I won?t see you disgraced ?
I will protect your name and your heart ?
Because I miss my friend 
Because ?I miss my friend 
Because I miss you, my friend

Preparations       
            (Pierre runs into Anatole on the street. Pierre is drunk, Anatole in a hurry.)

PIERRE
Ah, Anatole! Where are you off too?

ANATOLE
Pierre, good man,
Tonight I go away, on an adventure 
You'll not be seeing me for some time
I've found a new pleasure
And I'm taking her away
I'll send you a letter from Poland

PIERRE
Ha! An elopement!
Fool, you are married already!

ANATOLE
Don't talk to me of that!
I will not deprive myself of this one!
Tonight! I take her tonight!
Lend me fifty rubles?

PIERRE
Ah, that's a true sage
Living in the moment
What I wouldn't give to be like him!

DOLOKHOV
The plan for Natalie Rostova's abduction 
Had all been arranged and the preparations made
On the day that Sonya decided to save her
That was the day that the game was to be played
Natasha was to be on her back porch at ten 
Anatole and his troika would scoop her up and then 
They'd ride forty miles to the village of Kamenka,
Where an unfrocked priest was to make 'em get wed
Then back into the troika off they'd go
Take the Poland highroad to the wedding bed

ANATOLE
Passports, horses, ten thousand rubles I have taken from my sister
And another ten thousand raised with Dolokhov's help 

DOLOKHOV
We were gathered in my study drinking up some tea
Just Anatole the two wedding witnesses and me
An abacus and paper money strewn on the desk
Persian rugs and bearskins hanging grotesque 
Anatole was walking with his uniform unbuttoned
Walking to and fro
To and fro
To and fro

ANATOLE & DOLOKHOV
To and fro
To and fro
To and fro
To and fro

DOLOKHOV 
Now wait!
You better
Just 
Give it up now
Why dontcha
While there's still time!
You'd really better drop it all
Give it up now!
While there's still time!
Do you know?

ANATOLE
What, teasing again?
Fool don't talk nonsense!
Go to the devil! Eh?
Really this is no time for your stupid jokes

DOLOKHOV
I am not joking, I am talking sense
This is serious business, a dangerous business
Come here, come here, come here Anatole!
Why would I joke about it?
Me of all people
Who found the priest, raised the money, got the passports, got the horses?

ANATOLE
And well I think you for it
Do you think I am not grateful?

DOLOKHOV
And now you'll carry her away but will they let it stop there?
You haven't thought this through or do you just don't care?
Now listen to me tell it to you one last time
They will take you to the court and convict you for your crime
Already married and you're playing with a little girl
Don't you know, don't you think, don't you know?

ANATOLE
Nonsense, nonsense!
I'm scowling and grimacing 
Didn't I explain it to you, didn't I, what?

DOLOKHOV
And here Anatole,
With the stubborn attachment small-minded people have
For conclusions they've worked out for themselves
Repeated his argument to me for the hundredth time

ANATOLE
If this marriage isn't valid
Then I'm off the hook
But if it is valid, it really doesn't matter!
No one abroad is gonna know a thing about it
Isn't that so now don't you know?
Don't talk to me, don't don't what what
Ah go to hell now!
I'm a-clutching my hair
It's the very devil!
Here, feel how it beats!

(He pressed Dolokhov's hand to his heart. A light comes up on Natasha across the room.)

Ah mon cher, mon cher
Quel pied, quel regard!
What a foot she has, what a glance!
A goddess!

And my handsome lips
Mutter something tender to myself

It's time!
It's time!
Now then! Nearly ready? You're dawdling!
The driver is here
The driver is here
Balaga is here!

Lived, laughed and loved
Friends of my youth,

I'm going abroad

Goodbye my gypsy lovers

Hurrah!
Smash the glasses on the floor!
Let's go! Let's go!

(They start to leave.)

ANATOLE
No, wait, wait, wait!
Shut the door!
First we have to sit down!
That's the way

It's a Russian custom

(They shut the door and all sit down for a moment.)

All right

(They start to leave)

DOLOKHOV
Wait, wait, wait!
Where's the fur cloak?

I have heard what elopements are like
She'll rush out more dead than alive
Just in the things she's wearing
If you delay at all, there'll be tears and 'Papa' and 'Mama'
And she's frozen in a minute and must go back
But you wrap the fur cloak round her
And you carry her to the sleigh
That's the way
That's the way

ALL
That's the way
That's the way

BALAGA

DOLOKHOV
When they reached the gate Dolokhov whistled
The whistle was answered, and a maidservant ran out 

MAIDSERVANT
Come in through the courtyard or you'll be seen; she'll come out directly 

DOLOKHOV
Dolokhov stayed by the gate
Anatole followed the maid into the courtyard
Turned the corner, ran up to the porch

(Anatole is stopped by Marya D.)

MARYA D.
You will not enter my house, scoundrel!

DOLOKHOV
Anatole, come back!
Betrayed! Betrayed!
Betrayed, Anatole!
Come back!
Betrayed! Betrayed! Betrayed!

(Dolokhov rushes in and rescues Anatole. They flee.)

You dirty nasty wench of a thing

Do you hear what I am saying or not?

SONYA
Natasha's whole body shook
With noiseless, convulsive sobs
Marya touched her hand to her face

NATASHA
Don' touch me!
Let me be! What is it to me? I shall die!

MARYA D.
What are we to tell your father? Eh?
In my house!
In my house!
What are we to tell Prince Andrey? Eh?
Oh what do we tell your betrothed? 

NATASHA
I have no betrothed, I have refused him!

SONYA
Natasha, come here, kiss me
Press your wet face to mine

NATASHA
Don't touch me!

MARYA D.
Why didn't he come to the house,
Why didn't he openly ask for your hand?
You were not kept under lock and key!
Carrying you off like some gypsy girl!
And if he had carried you off, don't you think your father would have found him?
Your father, I know him,
He will challenge him to a duel and what then? Will that be all right? Eh?
He's a scoundrel, he's a wretch! That's a fact!

NATASHA
He is better than any of you I say
He is better than any of you I say
Why did you interfere! Oh God, what is it all?!
What is it?
Who are you to tell me anything?
Sonya, why?
Go away!
Everyone, go away!

Marya Dmitryevna tried to speak again but Natasha cried out 
Go away! Go away! You all hate and despise me!
And she threw herself down on the sofa

MARYA D.
Natasha!
Natalya...

I put a pillow under her head
Covered her with two quilts
Brought her a glass of lime-flower water
But Natasha did not respond
Well, let her sleep
Let her sleep

(Marya D. leaves)

NATASHA
But Natasha was not asleep
Her face was pale
Her eyes wide open
All that night she did not sleep or weep
She sat at the window
Waiting for him

A Call to Pierre       
            (A servant hands a letter to Pierre)

SERVANT
A letter from Marya Dmitryevna asking you to come and visit her
On a matter of great importance
Relating to Andrey Bolkonsky and his betrothed

PIERRE
What?
What can they want with me?

(He arrives at Marya D.'s)

MARYA D.
Pierre, old friend I'm sorry it's late
I'm sorry I haven't seen you about
Where have you been?
Where have you been?

PIERRE
I have been studying

MARYA D.
Pierre old friend we need your help 
Pierre old friend the family name
We need your help 
We need your help 
There's ruin at the door

PIERRE

MARYA D.
Natasha has let down the family

PIERRE
What?

MARYA D.
Natasha has broken with Andrey 

PIERRE
Natasha has tried to elope 

PIERRE

There's ruin at the door

PIERRE
Natasha, that charming girl?
I can't believe my ears
So I am not the only man
Tied to a bad woman
And Anatole, that stupid child
They'll lock him up for years
For Anatole is a married man!

MARYA D.
Married? He's married?

PIERRE
Yes

MARYA D.
Oh wait till I tell her

PIERRE
Poor Andrey

MARYA D.
And when Andrey comes home
He will challenge Anatole to a duel
And get himself killed
And all will be ruined

You must go see your brother-in-law
And tell him that he must leave Moscow
And not dare to let me set my eyes on him again

PIERRE 
At once

Find Anatole       
            PIERRE
Anatole, find Anatole
Anatole, find Anatole
The blood rushes to my heart
It's difficult to breathe
Anatole, find Anatole
Anatole, find Anatole
Not at the ice hills
Not at the gypsies'
Not at Komoneno's
Anatole, find Anatole
Anatole, find Anatole
To the Club

And at the Club all is going on as usual
The members eat their dinners
And gossip in small groups

PIERRE & CHORUS
Have I heard of Kuragin's abduction?
Is it true Natasha is ruined?

PIERRE
Nonsense, nonsense
Nothing has happened
Everything is fine

(Pierre's house)

ANATOLE
Natasha
Natasha
It is essential that I see Natasha
How can I see her?

HELENE
Anatole, come Anatole
Anatole, hush Anatole

(Marya D.'s house)

NATASHA
What? What?
I don't believe that he is married
I don't believe you
And I stare like a hunted wounded animal 
He can't be married!

(Pierre's house)

SERVANT (to Pierre)
Good evening sir
Prince Anatole is in the drawing room with the Countess

HELENE
Ah, Pierre
Sweet husband
You don't know what a plight our Anatole has had

PIERRE
Be quiet
I will not greet you
At this moment you are more repulsive to me than ever 

Anatole, come Anatole
Anatole, must speak to you

ANATOLE
Anatole followed with his usual jaunty step
But his face betrayed anxiety

PIERRE
Pierre closed the door and addressed Anatole without looking at him

Pierre & Anatole       
            (During this scene, Natasha prepares to poison herself)

PIERRE
You promised Countless Rostova to marry her and were about to elope, is that so?

ANATOLE
Mon cher
I don't consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that tone

PIERRE
My face, already pale
Becomes distorted by fury
I seize you by the collar with my big big hands 
And I shake you from side to side
Until your face shows a sufficient degree of terror
When I tell you I must talk to you!

ANATOLE
Come now, this is stupid!
What what don't don't!

PIERRE
You're a scoundrel and a blackguard
And I don't know what deprives me of the pleasure
Of smashing your head in with this!

(He takes a heavy paperweight and lifts it threateningly, but at once puts it back in its place)

Did you promise to marry her?

ANATOLE
I didn't think of it. I never promised, because -

PIERRE
Have you any letters of hers?
Any letters?

I shan't be violent, don't be afraid

(Anatole hands Pierre a pack of letters)

First, the letters
Second, tomorrow you must get out of Moscow

ANATOLE
But how can I?

PIERRE
Third
You must never breathe a word of what has happened between you and the Countess
Now I know I can't prevent your doing so
But if you have a spark of conscience

Pierre paces the room several times in silence

ANATOLE
Anatole sits at a table frowning and biting his lips

PIERRE
After all, you must understand
That besides your pleasure
There is such a thing as other people, and their happiness and peace 
And that you are ruining a whole life
For the sake of amusing yourself!
Amuse yourself with women like my wife
With them you're within your rights
But to promise a young girl to marry her
To deceive, to kidnap
Why don't you understand that that's as cruel as beating an old man or a child?

ANATOLE
Well I don't know about that, eh?
I don't know that and I don't want to
But you have used such words to me
'Scoundrel' and so on
Which as a man of honor I will not allow anyone to use

PIERRE
Is it satisfaction you want?

ANATOLE
You could at least take back your words, eh?
If you want me to do as you wish?

(Natasha drinks the poison)

PIERRE
Fine I take them back, I take them back!
And I ask you to forgive me
And if you require money for your journey -

ANATOLE
Anatole smiled
The reflection of that base and cringing smile
Which Pierre knew so well in his wife
Revolted him

PIERRE 
Oh, vile and heartless brood!

ANATOLE
Next day Anatole left
For Petersburg!

Natasha very ill
The whole house
A state of alarm and commotion
Natasha very ill
Having poisoned herself
With a bit of arsenic
She woke me in the middle of the night
And told me what she had done
And the doctors
And the antidotes
And now she is out of danger
But still so weak
And Andrey is to return
We wait with dread

Well, how are you?
Still getting stouter?

PIERRE
There's a new wrinkle
On your forehead old friend

ANDREY
It's good to see you
It's been way too long

PIERRE
My friend, you are in need
Your face is gloomy

ANDREY
No, I am well 
There's a war going on

Forgive me for troubling you;
I have received a refusal from Countess Rostova and have heard reports of your brother-in-law having sought her hand, or something of that kind

Here are her letters
Please give them to the Countess

PIERRE
Natasha is ill
She has been at death's door

ANDREY
I much regret her illness

PIERRE
And he smiled like his father
Coldly, maliciously

ANDREY
Well, it doesn't matter

PIERRE
You told me once
A fallen woman should be forgiven

ANDREY
But I didn't say that I could forgive
I can't

Yes, ask her hand again, be magnanimous, and so on?
Yes, that would be very noble
But I can't be that man
If you wish to be my friend 
Never speak of that again

Well, goodbye

Pierre & Natasha       
            PIERRE
Natasha was standing
In the middle of the drawing room
With a pale yet steady face
When I appeared in the doorway
She grew flustered and I hurried to her
I thought that she would give me her hand
But instead she stopped
Breathing heavily
Her thin arms hanging lifelessly
Just in the very pose
She used to stand in as a young girl
When she went to the middle of the ballroom to sing
But the look on her face was quite different

NATASHA
Peter Kirilovich -

PIERRE
Pierre

NATASHA
Prince Bolkonsky was your friend -
He is your friend
He once told me that I should turn to you

PIERRE
Pierre sniffed as he looked at her, but he didn't speak
Till then he had reproached her, and tried to despise her
But now he felt such pity for her
That there was no room in his soul for reproach 

NATASHA
He is here now
Tell him to ? tell him to forgive me

PIERRE
Yes, I will tell him to forgive you
But, he gave me your letters-

NATASHA
No, I know that all is over
I know that it never can be
But still I'm tormented by the wrongs I've done him
Tell him that I beg him to forgive, forgive
Forgive me for everything

PIERRE
Yes I will tell him, tell him everything
But-
But I should like to know one thing
Did you love-
Did you love that bad man?

NATASHA
Don't call him bad
But I don't know, I don't know at all

PIERRE
She began to cry
And a greater sense of pity, tenderness, and love overflowed Pierre's heart
He felt the tears begin to trickle underneath his spectacles 
And he hoped that no one would see

We won't speak of it anymore
We won't speak of it, my dear
But one thing I beg of you, consider me your friend
And if you ever need help, or simply to open your heart to someone
Not now, but your mind is clear
Think of me-

Pierre grew confused

NATASHA
Don't speak to me like that
I am not worth it!

PIERRE
Stop, stop, stop!

You have your whole life before you-

NATASHA
Before me? No, all is over for me!

PIERRE
All over?

(Music stops)

If I were not myself,
But the brightest, handsomest, 
Best man on earth,
And if I were free-
I would get down on my knees this minute
And ask you for your hand 
And for your love.

(Music resumes)

NATASHA
And for the first time in many days
I weep tears of gratitude
Tears of tenderness
Tears of thanks
And glancing at Pierre
O Pierre
I leave the room smiling

PIERRE
And restraining tears of tenderness
Tears of joy that choke me
I throw my fur coat on my shoulders
Unable to find the sleeves

Outside, my great broad chest
Breathes in deep the air with joy
Despite the ten degrees of frost

And I get my sleigh

The Great Comet of 1812       
            PIERRE
Where to now?
Where can I go now?
Not to the Club
Not to pay calls

Mankind seems so pitiful 
So poor
Compared to that softened, grateful, last glance
She gave me through her tears

CHORUS
It was clear and cold
About the dirty streets
Above the black roofs
Stretched the dark starry sky

PIERRE
This vast firmament
Open to my eyes
Wet with tears

CHORUS
And there in the middle
Above Prechistensky Boulevard
Surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stars
Shines the Great Comet of 1812
The Brilliant Comet of 1812

PIERRE
The comet said to portend
Untold horrors
And the end of the world

But for me
The comet brings no fear
No, I gaze joyfully

And this bright star
Having traced its parabola
With inexpressible speed
Through immeasurable space
Seems suddenly
To have stopped
Like an arrow piercing the earth
Stopped for me

It seems to me
That this comet
Feels me
Feels my softened and uplifted soul
And my newly melted heart
Now blossoming
Into a new life
