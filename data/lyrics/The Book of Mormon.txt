Hasa Diga Eebowai       
            MAFALA:
In this part of Africa, we ALL have a saying- whenver something bad happens, we just throw our hands up to the sky and say HASA DIGA EEBOWAI!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Hasa Diga Eebowai?

MAFALA:
Its the only way to get through all these troubled times. 
Theres war, poverty, famine... but having a saying makes it all seem better!

There isnt enough food to eat!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
People are starving in the street!

UGANDANS and MAFALA:
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

ELDER PRICE:
Well, thats pretty neat!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
DOes it mean no worries for the rest of our days?

MAFALA:
Kind of!

Weve had no rain in several days!

UGANDANS:
Hasa DIga Eebowai!

MAFALA:
And 80% of us have AIDS!

UGANDANS:
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

MAFALA:
Many young girls here get
Circumcised,
Their clits get cut right off.

ALL:
Way oh!

WOMEN:
And so we say up to the sky-

UGANDANS:
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

MAFALA:
Now you try!  Just stand up tall, tilt your head to the sky,
and list off all the bad things in your life!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Somebody took our luggage away!

UGANDANS:
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

ELDER PRICE:
The plane was crowded,
And the bus was late!

UGANDANS:
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

MAFALA:
When the world is getting you down,
Theres nobody else to blame!

UGANDANS:
Way oh!

MAFALA:
Raise your middle finger to the sky,
And curse his rotten name!

ELDER PRICE:
Wait, what?!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

UGANDANS:
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Am I saying it right?

ELDER PRICE:
Excuse me sir, but what EXACTLY does that phrase mean?

MAFALA:
Well, lets see... "Eebowai" means "God". 
And "Hasa Diga" means... "Fuck You". 
So I guess in English it would be "Fuck you, God!"

UGANDANS:
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

ELDER PRICE:
WHAT?!

MAFALA:
When God fucks you in the butt-

UGANDANS:
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

MAFALA:
Fuck him right back in his cunt!

UGANDANS:
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Fuck you, God!

ELDER PRICE:
Excuse me, Sir, but you should really NOT be saying that. 
Things arent always as bad as they seem!

MAFALA:
Oh really?  Well take this fucking asshole, Mutumbo. 
He got caught last week trying to RAPE a baby.

ELDER PRICE:
What?!  Why?!

MAFALA:
Some people in his tribe believe having sex with a virgin will cure their AIDS. 
There arent many virgins left, so some of them are turning to babies.

ELDER PRICE:
But... thats horrible!

MAFALA:
I know!

UGANDANS:
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

MAFALA:
Heres the butcher, he has AIDS.
Heres the teacher, she has AIDS.
Heres the doctor, he has AIDS.
Heres my daughter, she has A....
Wonderful disposition.
Shes all I have left in the world.
And if either of you lays a hand on her...
I will give you my AIDS!

UGANDANS:
If you dont like what we say,
Try living here a couple days!
Watch all your friends and family die!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
(Fuck you!)
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

Fuck you God in the ass, mouth,
And cunt-a
Fuck you God in the ass, mouth,
And cunt-a
Fuck you God in the ass, mouth
And cunt-a
Fuck you in the eye!

Hasa-
Diga Eebowai!
Hasa-
Fuck you in the other eye!

Fuck you!
Fuck you God!
Fuck you!
Fuck you God!
Fuck you!
Fuck you God!

Turn It Off       
            ELDER MCKINLEY:
I got a feeling,
That you could be feeling,
A whole lot better then you feel today
You say you got a problem,
well thats no problem,
Its super easy not to feel that way!

When you start to get confused because of thoughts in your head,
Dont feel those feelings!
Hold them in instead

Turn it off, like a light switch
just go click!
Its a cool little Mormon trick!
We do it all the time
When your feeling certain feels that just dont feel right
Treat those pesky feelings like a reading light
and turn em off,
Like a light switch just go bap!
Really whats so hard about that?
Turn it off! (Turn it off!)

When I was young my dad,
Would treat my mom real bad,
every time the Utah Jazz would loose.
Hed start a drinking,
and Id start a thinking,
How am I gonna keep my mom from getting abused?

Id see her all scared and my soul was dying,
My dad would say to me, Now dont you dare start crying.

Turn it off, (Like a light switch just go click!)
(Its our nifty little Mormon trick!)
Turn it off! (Turn. It. Off!)

My Sister was a dancer, but she got cancer,
My doctor said she still had two months more
I thought she had time, so I got in line
for the new I-phone at the apple store.

She lay there dying with my father and mother
Her very last words were "where is my brother?"

(Turn it off!) Yeah!  (Bid those sad feelings a due!)
The fear I might get cancer too,

When I was in fifth grade, I had a friend Steve Blade,
He and I were close as two friend could be
One thing led to another, and soon I would discover,
I was having really strange feelings for Steve

I thought about us, on a deserted Island
Wed swim naked in the sea, and then hed try and...

WOAH!  Turn if off, like a light switch,
there its gone! (Good for you!)
My hetero side just won!
Im all better now,
Boys should be with girls thats heavenly fathers plan
So if you ever feel you rather be with a man,
Turn it off.

ELDER PRICE: 
Well Elder McKinley, I think its ok that your having gay thoughts,
just so long as you never act on them.

ELDER MCKINLEY:
No, because then your just keeping it down,
Like a dimmer switch on low, (On low!)
Thinking nobody needs to know! (Uh oh!)

ELDER PRICE:
But thats not true!

ELDER MCKINLEY: 
Being gay is bad, but lying is worse,
So just realize you have a curable curse,
And turn it off!  (Turn it off, turn it off!)

(Dance)

Turn it off!

Now how do you feel!

ELDER PRICE: 
The same

ELDER MCKINLEY: 
Then you only got yourself to blame,
You didnt pretend hard enough,
Imagine that your brain is made of tiny boxes,
and find the box thats gay and CRUSH IT!
Ok?

ELDER PRICE:
No, no, -Im- not having gay thoughts

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Alright!  It worked!

(Yay!)

(Turn it off!)

(Turn it off, Turn it off!)

(Turn it off, turn it off like a light switch just go click click!
What a cool little Mormon Trick! Trick trick!
We do it all the time!)

ELDER MCKINLEY: 
When your feeling certain feelings that just dont seem right!
Treat those pesky feelings like a reading light!
Turn it off!  (Like a light switch, shut it off!)
(Now he isnt gay anymore!)

(Turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it...!)
(Turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it...!)
(Turn it...)

ELDER MCKINLEY:  Turn it off!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Im just trying to make you feel better!

ELDER PRICE:
I feel fine.... But this is what Im talking out Elder, out focus needs to be on our work. 
Do you understand how difficult this is gonna be? 
The missionaries here have yet to baptize a SINGLE person to the chruch.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Well, if they had already baptized a bunch of Africans here,
then it wounlt be so incredible when YOU did it, now would it?

ELDER PRICE:
I guess.... I guess thats kind of true....

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Dont forget what you told me!  You are awesome! 
Together, were gonna bring LOTS of Africans to the church! 
And my Dad will finally feel proud of me... instead of just feeling "stuck" with me....

ELDER PRICE:
You know what, Elder?  I think your Dads got plenty to be proud of already.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Really?!

ELDER PRICE:
Yeah!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Evening star shines brightly,
God makes like anew!
Tomorrow is a latter day,
And I am here for you.

ELDER PRICE:
I am here for you, too.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM and ELDER PRICE:
We are here
For us.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:

All-American Prophet       
            ELDER PRICE:
You all know the Bible
Is made of Testaments old and new.
Youve been told its just tose two parts,
Or only one, if youre a Jew.
But what if I were to tell you
Theres a FRESH third part out there?
That was found by a HIP new prophet
Who had a little...
Donny Osmond flair?

Have you heard of the
All-American Prophet?
The blonde-haired,
Blue-eyed voice of God!
He didnt come from the Middle East
Like those other holy men!
No, Gods favorite prophet was...
All-American!


Im gonna take you back to Biblical times; 1823. 
An American man man named Joe livin on a farm in the holy land of Rodchester, New York!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
You meant he Mormon prophet Joseph Smith?!

ELDER PRICE:
Thats right, that young man spoke to God!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
He spoke to God?!

ELDER PRICE:
And God said:
"Joe, people really need to know
That the Bible isnt two parts!
Theres a part THREE to
The Bible, Joe!  And I, God
Have anointed you to dig up this
Part three that is buried by the
Tree on the hill in your backyard!"

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Wow, God says go to you backyard and start digging, that makes PERFECT SENSE!

ELDER PRICE:
Joseph Smith went up to that hill,
And dug where he was told.
And deep in the ground, Joseph found
Shining plates of gold!

JOSEPH SMITH:
What are these golden plates?
Who buried them here, and why?

ELDER PRICE:
Then appeared an angel!
His name was Moroni!

MORONI:
I am Moroni....

ELDER PRICE:
The All-American Angel!
My people lived here
Long, long ago!
This is the history of my race!
Please read the words within!
We were Jews who met with Christ,
But we were...
All-American!

But dont let anybody see these plates
Except for you...
They are only for you to see...
Even if people ask you to show
The plates to them, DONT.
Just copy them onto normal paper.
Even thought this might make them
Question if the plates are real, or not,
This is sort of what God is going for....

Joseph took the plates home,
And wrote down what he found inside!
He turned those plates into a book,
Then rushed into town and cried:

JOSEPH SMITH:
Hey!  God spoke to me and gave me
This blessed ancient tome!
He hath commanded me to publish it,
And stick it in every home!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Wow!  So the Bible is really a trilogy,
and the Book of Mormon is Return of the Jedi?!  IM interested!

ELDER PRICE:
Now, many people didnt believe
Yhe prophet Joseph Smith.
They thought hed made up this part three
That was buried by a tree on the hill in his backyard!

TOWNSPEOPLE:
LIAR!

ELDER PRICE:
But Joe said:

JOSEPH SMITH:
This is no lie1
I speak to God all the time,
And he told me to head west!
So Ill take my part three
From the hill with the tree,
Feel free if youd like
To come along with me,
To the promised land!

TOWNSPEOPLE:
The PROMISED LAND?

JOSEPH SMITH:
Paradise!
On the west coast!
Nothing but fruit and fields
As far as the eye can see!

ALL:
Have you heard of the
All-American prophet?
He found a brand new book
About Jesus Christ!
Were following him to paradise;
We call ourselves Mormons!
And our new religion is...
All-American!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Wow!  How much does it cost!?

ELDER PRICE:
The Mormons kept on searching for
That place to settle down,
But every time they thought theyd found it,
They got kicked out of town!
And even though people wanted
To see the golden plates,
Joseph never showed em!

GOTSWANA:
I have maggots in my scrotum.

ELDER PRICE:
Um... okay.


Well, anyway...

Now comes the part of our story
That gets a little bit sad...
On the way to the promised land,
Mormons made people mad.
Joseph was shot by and angry mob,
And knew hed soon be done....

JOSEPH SMITH:
You must lead the people now,
My good friend... Brigham Young.

Oh, God... why are you letting me die?
Without having me
Show people the plates?
Theyll have no proof I was
Telling the truth or not.
Theyll have to believe it just...
Cause.
Oh!  I guess thats kinda what you
Were going for....
Blargggh...

ELDER PRICE:
The prophet Joseph Smith DIED for what he believed in. 
But his followers, they kept on heading west. 
And Brigham Young led them to paradise.  A sparkling land in Utah called...
Salt Lake City!
And there the Mormons multiplied, and made BIG MORMON families. 
Generation to generation until finally... they made ME. 
And now its my JOB,
TO LEAD YOU WHERE THOSE EARLY SETTLERS WERE LEAD LONG AGO!!!

TOWNSPEOPLE and PRICE:
Have you heard of the All-American prophet?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Kevin Price!!!

TOWNSPEOPLE and ELDER PRICE:
The next in line
To be the voice of God?!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
My best friend!!!

TOWNSPEOPLE, ELDER PRICE, and ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Hes gonna do something
Incredible!
And be Joseph Smith again!
Cause Kevin Price the prophet is...
All...
All...
All...
ALL-AMERICAN-!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
If you order now, well also throw in a set of steak knives!

ALL:
ALL-AMERICAN!

Sal Tlay Ka Siti       
            My mama once told me of a place
With waterfalls and unicorns flying
Where there was no suffering, no pain
Where there was laughter instead of dying
I always thought sheâd made it up
To comfort me in times of pain
But now I know that place is real
Now I know its name

Sal Tlay Ka Siti
Not just a story mama told
But a village in Ooh-Tah
Where the roofs are thatched with gold
If I could let myself believe
I know just where Iâd be
Right on the next bus to paradise
Sal Tlay Ka Siti

I can imagine what it must be like
This perfect, happy place
Iâll bet the goat-meat there is plentiful
And they have vitamin injections by the case
The war-lords there are friendly
They help you cross the street
And thereâs a Red Cross on every corner
With all the flour you can eat!

Sal Tlay Ka Siti
The most perfect place on Earth
Where flies donât bite your eyeballs
And human life has worth
It isnât a place of fairytales
Its as real as it can be
A land where evil doesnât exist
Sal Tlay Ka Siti

And Iâll bet the people are open minded
And donât care who youâve been
And all I hope is that when I find it
Iâm able to fit in
Will I fit inâ

Sal Tlay Ka Siti
A land of hope and joy
And if I want to get there
I just have to follow that white boy

You were right, mama
You didnât lie
The place is real
And Iâm gonna fly!

Iâm on way
Soon life wonât be so shitty
Now salvation has a name
Sal Tlay Ka Siti

Man Up       
            ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
What did Jesus do,
When they sentanced him to die?
Did he try to run away?
Did he just break down and cry?

No, Jesus dug down deep,
Knowing what he had to do-
When faced with his own death,
Jesus knew that he had to...

Man up.
He had to man up.
So he crawled up on that cross,
And he stuck it out.
And he manned up.
Christ, he manned up.
And taught us all what real manning
Up is about!

And now its up to me
And its time to man up!
Jesus had his time ta,
Now its mine ta MAN UP!

Im taking the reins,
Im crossing the bear!
Just like Jesus,
Im growing a pair!
Ive gotta stand up,
Cant just clam up,
Its time ta-
MAN UP!

Cuz theres a time in your life
When you know youve got to
MAN UP.
Dont let it pass you by,
Theres just one time to
MAN UP.

Watch me man up like
Nobody else!
Im gonna man up all
Over myself!
Ive got to get ready,
Its time ta,
Time ta!

What did Jesus do
When they put nails in his hands?
Did he scream like a girl?
Or did he take it like a man?
When someone had to die
To save us from our sins,
Jesus said "Ill do it!"
And he took it on the chin!

He manned up!
He manned up,
He took a bullet for me and you,
Thats man up.
Real man up.
And now its my time ta...
DO IT TOO!

Time to be a hero
And slay the monster!
Time to battle darkness,
Youre not my father!
Im gonna time ta, just watch me go!
Time to stand up and steal the show!
Time ta!  Mine ta!
Time ta!  Time ta!
TIME TA.

            ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
And lo, the Lord said unto the Nephites: 
"I know you're really depressed, what with all your... AIDS,
and everything... but there is an answer in Christ."

NABULUNGI:
You see?  This book CAN help us!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:

CUNNINGHAMS FATHER:
Youre stretching the truth again,
And you know it-

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:

MORONI, MORMON, SMITH, and FATHER:

And adding fiction!
Be careful how you prcoeed, Arnold.
When you fib, theres a price.

MIDDALA:
Ahh, this it bullshit! 
The story I'VE been told is that the way to cure AIDS is by sleeping with a virgin!
I'm gonna go and rape a baby!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
What?!  Oh my-NO!  You cant do that!!!  NO!

MIDDALA:
Why not?!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Because that is DEFINITELY against Gods will!

MIDDALA:
Says who?! 
Where in that book of yours does it say ANYTHING about sleeping with a baby, huh?!
Nowhere.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Uh, behold!  The Lord said to the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith:
"You SHALL NOT have sex with that infant!" 
LO! Joseph said: "Why not, Lord?  Huh?  Why not?" 
And the Lord said "If you lay with an infant, you shall.... Burn in the fiery pits of Mordar!!!"

MIDDALA:
...really?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Uh-uh... Uh-uh!  "A baby cannot cure your illness, Joseph Smith. 
I shall give unto you... a FROG!  And thus,
Joesph laid with the frog, and his AIDS was no more!

UGANDANS:
Ohhhhh!

MORONI, MORMON, SMITH, and DAD:
Youre making things up again, Arnold.
Youre recklessly warping
The words of Jesus!

HOBBITS:
You cant just say what you want, Arnold!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Come, on, Hobbits!

Youre digging yourself a deep hole!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:

Just by making things up again, right?!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:

NABULUGI:
Gotswana is going to cut off his daughters clitoris!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Huh?!

GOTSWANA:
This is all very interesting, but women have to be circumcised if thats what the General wants!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
No, no, doing that to a lady is definitely against Gods will!

GOTSWANA:
How do you know?!  Christ never said NOTHIN bout no clitoris!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
...YES!  YES HE DID!
In ancient New York, three men were about to cut off a Mormon womans...clitoris. 
But...right before they did, Jesus had... BOBA FETT turn em into FROGS!

GOTSWANA:
Frogs?

ASMERET:
You mean like the frogs that got fucked by Joseph Smith?!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Right!  Right!  Like THOSE frogs! 
For a clitoris is holy amongst ALL things, said he!

MORONI, MORMON, SMITH, DAD, and HOBBITS:
Youre making things up again, Arnold.

UGANDANS:

And adding fiction!

I Believe       
            ELDER PRICE
Ever since I was a child
I tried to be the best...
So what happened?
My family and friends all said I was blessed...
so what happened?

It was supposed to be all so exciting.
To be teaching of Christ across the sea.
But I allowed my faith to be shaken-
Oh, what's the matter with me?

I've always longed to help the needy.
To do the things I never dared.
This was the time for me to step up.
So then why was I so scared?

A warlord that shoots people in the face.
What's so scary about that?
I must trust that my Lord is mightier,
And always has my back.
Now I must completely devout
I can't have even one shred of doubt!

I believe-
That the Lord God created the universe.
I believe-
That he sent his only son to die for my sins.
And I believe-
That ancient Jews built boats and sailed
to America.
I am a Mormon.
And a Mormon just believes.

You cannot just believe part-way.
You have to believe in it all.
My problem was doubting
the Lord's will.
Instead of standing tall.
I can't allow myself to have any doubt.

It's time to set my worries free.
Time to show the world
What Elder Price is about.
And share the power inside of me!

I believe-
That God has a plan for all of us.
I believe-
That plan involves
Me getting my own planet.
And I believe
That the current President of the church,
Thomas Monson, speaks, directly to God.
I am a Mormon and, dang it,
A Mormon just believes.

CHORUS
A Mormon just believes.

ELDER PRICE
I know that I must go and do-
The things my God commands.

CHORUS
Things my God commands.

ELDER PRICE
I realize now why he sent me here!
If you ask the Lord in faith
He will always answer you just believe
In him and have no fear.

GUARD
(spoken) General! We have an intruder! He just walked right into camp!

ELDER PRICE
I believe!!!
That Satan has a hold of you.
I believe!
That the Lord God has sent me here!
And I believe that in 1978 God changed his mind about black people!!

CHORUS
Black People!!

ELDER PRICE
You can be a Mormon!
A Mormon who just believes.

GENERAL
(spoken) The fuck is this?

ELDER PRICE
And now I can feel the excitement.
This is the moment I was born to do.
And I feel so incredible-
to be sharing my faith with you.
The scriptures say that if you ask in faith,
If you ask God himself you'll know.
But you must ask him without any doubt,
And let your spirit grow!

CHORUS
Let your spirit grow!

ELDER PRICE
I believe!
That God lives on a planet called Kolob!
I believe!
That Jesus has his own planet as well.
And I believe
That the Garden of Eden was in Jackson County, Missouri.

If you believe,
The Lord will reveal it.
And you'll know it's all true-
You'll just feel it.

You'll be a Mormon!!!
And by gosh-
A Mormon just belieeeeeeeeves!!!!
Oh, I believe!
I believe!

CHORUS
Believe!

Joseph Smith American Moses       
            And now we wish to honour you with the story of Joseph Smith, the American Moses!
Well this is very good, priestess
Mormon!
I?m going to take you back in time! (mormon)
To the United States year 1823. (mormon)
A small and odd village called oopstate New York. (oopstate)
There was Disease, and famine (so sick)
But also in the village lived a simple farmer who would change everything
His name was Joseph Smith

Ha-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
Joseph Smith, American Moses!
Praise be to Joseph! American prophet man.

AY! My name is Joseph Smith, and I?m going to fuck this baby!
What?!

No no Joseph! Don?t fuck the baby!
Joseph Smith, don?t fuck the baby.

Suddenly the clouds parted,
And Joseph Smith was visited by GOD!

Joseph Smith, do not fuck a baby.
I?ll get rid of your AIDS if you fuck this frog.

Ha-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya

Joseph Smith fucked the frog god gave him,
And his AIDS went away!
Then a great wizard named Maronai came down from the starship enterprise

Joseph Smith! Your village is shit!
You should lead the villagers to a new village.
Take these fucking golden plates (awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay)

And on the plates were written the directions to a new land.
Sal Tlay Ka Siti (Sal Tlay Ka Siti)
Joseph tried to convince all the villagers to follow him and his golden plates.

Liberation! Equality! No more slavery for oopstate Mormon people!

I got de golden plates! (gold plates)
I gunna lead the people! (we head west)
We gotta stick together! (for months)
We gotta hel? eachother! (we will for months)
And so we climb the mountain! (we head west)
And we cross the river (we head west)
And we fight the oppression! (for months)
By being nice to everyone (we are Mormons)

Not so fast mormons! You shall not pass my mountain!
(Down from the mountain look who comes! The American warman, Rigam Yam!
YES! I am Rigam Yam!
I cut off my daughters clitoris.
That made god angry so he turned my nose into a clit for punishment!
(Rigam Yam, his nose was a clitoris)

What will you do Joseph? Will you fight the clitoris man?

Not fight him, help him! (oooohhhhhhhh)

Joseph Smith took his magical fuck frog and rubbed it upon Rigam Yams clit-face,
And behold, Rigam was cured!

Joseph Smith! Magical AIDS frog!
Frog on his clit-face!

Rigam Yam was so greatful, he decided to join the Mormons and their journey.

Compassion!
Courtesy!
Let?s be really fucking polite to everyone!

I got de golden plates! (gold plates)
I gunna lead the people! (we head west)
We gotta stick together! (for months)

Now comes the part of our story that gets a little bit sad. (ohh)
After travelling for so long,
The Mormons ran out of fresh water,
And became sick, with dysentery!

Oh fuck!

Oh no! The prophet Joseph smith is now getting sick!
Rigam Yam, you must take the golden plates and lead the Mormons to the promise land!

Despiration!
Mortality!
Loss of faith!
I?????.. got the golden plates (gold plates)
I gunna lead the people (we head west)?

Even though their prophet had died,
The Mormons stuck together,
And helped eachother,
And were really nice to everyone they came across.
And one day, the Mormons finally found,
Sal Tlay Ka Siti! (Sal Tlay Ka Siti)
And then, the Mormons danced with ewoks,
And were greeted by Jesus!

Welcome Mormons!
Now, let?s all have as many babies as we can,
And make big, Mormon families!

Woohoo!
Fuck your woman, fuck your man,
It is all part of gods plan
Mormons help god as they can,
Here in Salt Lake City land!

Thank you!  Thank you,
For now we are fucking.
Thank you! Thank you,
Come god wants us fucking.
Thank you! Thank you,
But get back to fucking.
Thaaaa- Get back to fucking!
