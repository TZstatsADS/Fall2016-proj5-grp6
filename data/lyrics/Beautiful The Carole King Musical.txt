So Far Away       
            So far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're just time away

Long ago I reached for you and there you stood
Holding you again could only do me good
Oh, how I wish I could
But you're so far away

One more song about moving along the highway
Can't say much of anything that's new
If I could only work this life out my way
I'd rather spend it being close to you

But you're so far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're so far away

Traveling around sure gets me down and lonely
Nothing else to do but close my mind
I sure hope the road don't come to own me
There's so many dreams I've yet to find

But you're so far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
Doesn't help to know you're so far away

It Might as Well Rain Until September       
            What shall I write?
What can I say?
How can I tell you how much I miss you?

The weather here has been as nice as it can be
Althought it doesn't really matter much to me
For all the fun I'll have while you're so far away
It might as well rain until September

I don't need sunny skies for thing I like to do
'Cause I stay home the whole day long and think of you
As far as I'm concerned each day's a rainy day
So It might as well rain until September

My friends look forward to their picnics on the beach
Yes everybody loves the summertime
But you know darling while your arms are out of reach
The summer isn't any friend of mine

It doesn't matter whethee skies are grey or blue
It's raining in my heart 'cause I can't be with you
I'm only living for the day you're home to stay
So It might as well rain until September
September, September, oh
It might as well rain until September

Some Kind of Wonderful       
            All you have to do is touch my hand
To show me you understand
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful

Anytime my little world is blue
I just have to look at you
And everything seems to be
Some kind of wonderful

I know I can't express
This feeling of tenderness
There's so much I want to say
But the right words just don't come my way

I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me
That's some kind of wonderful

Some kind of wonderful
(Sweet lips)
Some kind of wonderful
Wonderful, wonderful
(Warm eyes)
(Soft sighs)
Some kind of wonderful

Some kind of wonderful
(Sweet lips)
Some kind of wonderful
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful
(Warm eyes)
Some kind of wonderful

Happy Days Are Here Again       
            CYNTHIA:
I'd like to say a thing or two
About this song I sing for you
These are not the words you thought you knew
To Happy Days Are Here Again

There's a reason for the switch
I'm making a creative pitch
With the words I wrote without a hitch
To Happy Days Are Here Again

I came to show you my style
My name is Cynthia Weil
W-E-I-L

My lyrics will be slick and smart
Reminding you of Lorenz Hart
And we'll both sing when we top the chart
Happy Days Are Here Again!

Take me home!

You want a sonnet
I'll get right on it
I like a good rhyme
More than a good time
My pen's on fire
And I'm for hire

Donny let me write for you

Take Good Care of My Baby       
            My tears are fallin' 'cause you've taken her away
And though it really hurts me so
There's something that I've gotta say

Take good care of my ba-a-a-by
Please don't ever make her blu-u-u-ue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinking of her
In everything you say and do-o-o-o

Aww, take good care of my ba-a-a-by
Now don't you ever make her cry-y-y-y
Just let your love surround her
Paint a rainbow all around her
Don't let her see a cloudy sky

Once upon a time that little girl was mine
If I'd been true, I know she'd never be with you

So, take good care of my ba-a-a-by
Be just as kind as you can be-e-e-e
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me

Who Put the Bomp       
            I'd like to thank the guy
Who wrote the song
That made my baby
Fall in love with me
Who put the bomp
In the bomp bah bomp bah bomp?
Who put the ram
In the rama lama ding dong?
Who put the bop
In the bop shoo bop shoo bop?
Who put the dip
In the dip da dip da dip?
Who was that man?
I'd like to shake his hand
He made my baby
Fall in love with me (yeah!!)
When my baby heard
"Bomp bah bah bomp "
"Bah bomp bah bomp bah bomp bomp"
Every word went right into her heart
And when she heard them singin'
"Rama lama lama lama"
"Rama ding dong"
She said we'd never have to part
So
Who put the bomp
In the bomp bah bomp bah bomp?
Who put the ram
In the rama lama ding dong?
Who put the bop
In the bop shoo bop shoo bop?
Who put the dip
In the dip da dip da dip?
Who was that man?
I'd like to shake his hand
He made my baby
Fall in love with me (yeah!!)
Each time that we're alone
Boogity boogity boogity
Boogity boogity boogity shoo
Sets my baby's heart all aglow
And everytime we dance to
Dip da dip da dip
Dip da dip da dip
She always says she loves me so
So
Who put the bomp
In the bomp bah bomp bah bomp?
Who put the ram
In the rama lama ding dong?
Who put the bop
In the bop shoo bop shoo bop?
Who put the dip
In the dip da dip da dip?
Who was that man?
I'd like to shake his hand
He made my baby
Fall in love with me (yeah!!)

Will You Love Me Tomorrow       
            Tonight you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic of your sighs
Will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow

He's Sure the Boy I Love       
            [Spoken:]
I always dreamed the boy I loved would come along
And he'd be tall and handsome, rich and strong.
Now that boy I love has come to me,
But he sure ain't the way I thought he'd be.
He doesn't look like a movie star,
He doesn't drive a Cadillac car,
He sure ain't yhe boy I've been dreamin' of,
But he's sure the boy I love.
Let me tell ya now,
He' never be a big business man
He always buys on the installment plan
He sure ain't the boy I been dreamin' of,
But he's sure the boy I love.
When he holds me tight,
Everythings right,
Crazy as it seems,
I'm his, whatever he is,
And I forget all of my dreams,
And everybody knows...
He doesn't hang diamonds round my neck,
And all he's got's an unemployment check
He sure ain't the boy I been dreamin' of,
But he's sure the boy I love.

Up on the Roof       
            When this old world starts getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right in to space

On the roof it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below can't bother me

Let me tell you now
When I come home feelin' tired and beat 
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet
I get away from the hustling crowds
And all that rat race noise down in the street

On the roof's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Oh, let's go 
up on the roof

At night the stars put on a show for free
And darling, you can share it all with me

I keep a-telling you
Right smack down in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble proof
So if this world starts getting you down
there's room enough for two up on the roof

Up on the roof
Everyhting's all right
Up on the roof
Oh, come on baby
Up on the roof
Up on the roof

It's easier than learning your ABC's
So come on, come on do the locomotion with me

You gotta swing your hips now
Come on baby jump up jump back
Oh well, I think you've got the knack

Now that you can do it let's make a chain now
Come on baby do the locomotion
Chug-a-chug a motion like a railroad train now
Come on baby do the locomotion

Do it nice and easy now and don't lose control
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul
Come on, come on do the locomotion with me

Move around the floor in a locomotion
Come on baby do the locomotion
Do it holdin' hands if you get the notion
Come on baby do the locomotion

There's never been a dance that's so easy to do
It even makes you happy when you're feeling blue
Come on, come on do the locomotion with me

Pleasant Valley Sunday       
            The local rock group down the street
Is trying hard to learn their song
They serenade the weekend squire
Who just came out to mow his lawn

Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
Charcoal burning everywhere
Rows of houses that are all the same
And no one seems to care

See Mrs. Gray, she's proud today
Because her roses are in bloom
And Mr. Green, he's so serene
He's got a TV in every room

Another Pleasant Valley Sunday
Here in status symbol land
Mothers complain about how hard life is
And the kids just don't understand

Creature comfort goals
They only numb my soul
And make it hard for me to see

My thoughts all seem to stray
To places far away
I need a change of scenery

There's something wrong here, there can be no denying
One of us is changing, or maybe we've stopped trying

Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide

You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool

(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman       
            Lookin' out on the morning rain
I used to feel uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired

Before the day I met you, life was so unkind
But your love was the key to my peace of mind

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like
A natural woman

When my soul was in the lost-and-found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it

Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
'Cause if I make you happy I don't need to do more

You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like

            You've got to get up every morning with a smile on your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
You're gonna find, yes, you will
That you're beautiful as you feel

Waiting at the station with a workday wind a-blowing
I've got nothing to do but watch the passers-by
Mirrored in their faces I see frustration growing
And they don't see it showing, why do I?

You've got to get up every morning with a smile on your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
You're gonna find, yes, you will
That you're beautiful as you feel

I have often asked myself the reason for sadness
In a world where tears are just a lullaby
If there's any answer, maybe love can end the madness
Maybe not, oh, but we can only try

You've got to get up every morning with a smile on your face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Then people gonna treat you better
You're gonna find, yes, you will
That you're beautiful as you feel

I Feel the Earth Move       
            I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down, tumbling down
I feel my heart start to trembling
Whenever you're around

Ooh, baby, when I see your face
Mellow as the month of May
Oh, darling, I can't stand it
When you look at me that way

I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down, tumbling down
I feel my heart start to trembling
Whenever you're around

Oh, darling, when you're near me
And you tenderly call my name
I know that my emotions
Are something I just can't tame
I've just got to have you, baby

I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down, tumbling down
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down
I just lose control
Down to my very soul
I get a hot and cold all over
I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down,
Tumbling down, tumbling down...

On Broadway       
            They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway (On Broadway)
They say there's always magic in the air (On Broadway)
But when you're walkin' down that street
And you ain't had enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere (On Broadway)

They say the women treat you fine on Broadway (On Broadway)
But looking at them just gives me the blues (On Broadway)
'Cause how ya gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes

On Broadway

They say that I won't last too long on Broadway (On Broadway)
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home, they all say (Catch a Greyhound)
But they're dead wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar

They say that I won't last too long
They say that I won't last too long
And I won't quit till I'm a star
I won't quit till I'm a star
I won't quit till I'm a star

On Broadway
