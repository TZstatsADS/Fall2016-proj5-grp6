Little Bit of Good       
            Mary Sunshine:
When I was a tiny tot 
Of maybe two or three
I can still remember what
My mother said to me...

Place rose colored glasses on your nose
And you will see the robins
Not the crows 

For in the tense and tangled web
Our weary lives can weave
You're so much better off
If you believe...

That there's a little bit of good
In everyone
In everyone you'll ever know

Yes, there's a little bit of good
In everyone
Though many times, it doesn't show

It only takes a taking time 
With one another
For under every mean veneer
Is someone warm and dear 
Keep looking...

For that bit of good in everyone
The ones you call bad
Are never all bad
So try to find that little bit of good

Just a little, little bit of good

Is someone warm and dear
Keep looking...

For that little good in everyone
Although you meet rats
They're not complete rats
So try to find that little bit of good!

The name on everybody's lips
Is gonna be Roxie
The lady rakin' in the chips
Is gonna be Roxie

I'm gonna be a celebrity
That means somebody everyone knows
They're gonna recognize my eyes
My hair, my teeth, my boobs, my nose

From just some dumb mechanic's wife
I'm gonna be Roxie
Who says that murder's not an art?

And who in case she doesn't hang
Can say she started with a bang?
Foxy Roxie Hart!

Roxie:
You wanna know something? I always wanted to be in vaudeville. 
And now that I'm a celebrity, I'm gonna have me a swell act, 
too. Yeah, I'll get a boy to work with - someone who can lift 
me up, show me off - Oh, hell, I'll get two boys. It'll frame 
me better. Think "Big," Roxie, think "Big." I'm gonna get me

"Good luck to you, Roxie"
And I'll appear in a lavaliere
That goes all the way down to my waist

Boys:
Here a ring, there a ring
Everywhere a ring a ling

Roxie:
But always the best of taste
Oooh, I'm a star.

Boys;
And the audience loves her.

Roxie:
And I love the audience. And the audience loves me for 
loving them. And I love the audience for loving me. And 
we just love each other. That's because none of us got 
enough love in our childhood.

Boys:
That's right.

Last Update: June, 10th 2013

I Can't Do It Alone       
            Velma:
My sister and I had an act that couldn't flop
My sister and I were headed straight for the top
My sister and I eared a thou a week at least
(Oh, sure)
But my sister is now, unfortunately, deceased

Oh, I know, it's sad, of course,
But a fact is still a fact
And now all that remains
Is the remains
Of a perfect double act!

Roxie, do you know you are exactly the same size as my sister? 
Oh, you would fit in her wardrobe perfectly. Look, why don't I 
just show you some of the act, huh?
Watch this.
(She dances)
Now, you have to imagine this with two people.
It's swell with two people.

First I'd....(Drums!)
Then she'd...(Saxophone!)
Then we'd...(Together!)
But I can't do it alone!
Then she'd...
Then I'd...
Then we'd...
But I can't do it alone!

She'd say, "What's your sister like?"
I'd say, "MEN,"
Yuk, yuk, yuk
She'd say, "you're the cat's meow"
Then we'd wow
The crowd again
When she'd go...
I'd go...
We'd go...

And then those ding-dong daddies started to roar
Whistled, stomped, and stamped on the floor
Yelling, screaming, begging for more.

And we'd say, "O.K. fellas, keep your socks up. 
You ain't seen nothing yet!"

(She dances.)
Ah, aha, yeah!
But I simply cannot do it alone.

Well? What did ya think? Come on, you can say.
(Roxie gives her raspberry.)

Velma:
O.K. O.K. The first part can always be rewritten. But the 
second part was really nifty. Watch this!

Then she'd...(See, get it, right?)
Then I'd...(Then I kick really high...)
Then we'd...
But I can't do it alone!
She'd say, "What state's Chicago in?"
I'd say, "ILL!"
Did ya get that?
She'd say, "turn your motor off!"
I can hear 'em cheerin' still
When she'd go...
I'd go...
We'd go...(Sideways!)
And then those two-bit Johnnies did it up brow
To cheer the best attraction in town
They really tore the balcony down

And we'd say, "O.K. fellas, O.K., we're goin' home, but 
here's a few more partin' shots!" And this...this we did 
in perfect unison.
(She dances.)
Cymbals crash crash crash
Now, you've seen me goin' through it
You can see there's nothin' to it
But I simply cannot do it
Alone!

(Roxie turns her down.)

I Know a Girl       
            Velma:
Can you imagine?
I mean can you imagine?
Do you believe it?
I mean, do you believe it?

I know a girl
A girl who lands on top
You could put her face
Into a pail of slop
And she'd come up smelling like a rose
How she does it, heaven knows.

Reporter:
Hold on, everybody, she's comin' out now. 
(Roxie enters, followed by a very happy Doctor.)
Well, Doctor, is she or isn't she?

Velma:
She is.

Doctor:
She is!

Velma:
I know a girl
A girl with so much luck
She could get run over by a two-ton truck
Then brush herself off and walk away
How she does it, I couldn't say

Billy:
So, Doc, would you swear to that statement in court?

Doctor:
Oh, yeah.

Billy:
Good...you wanna button your fly?

Velma:
Whilst I on the other hand
Put my face in a pail of slop
And I would smell like a pail of slop
I, on the other hand
Get run over by a truck
And I am deader than a duck

I know a girl who tells so many lies
Anything that's true would truly cross her eyes
But what that mouse is selling
That whole world buys
And nobody smells a rat.

Roxie:
Oh, please Ladies and Gentlemen of the press - leave the two 
of us alone so that we can rest.

Velma:
The two of us?
Can you imagine?
I mean, can you imagine?

Reporter:
Can I have one last picture, please?

Roxie:
Oh, sure, anything for the press.

Velma:
Do you believe it?
I mean, do you believe it?

Roxie:
My dear little baby

Velma:
"My dear little baby."

Me and My Baby       
            Roxie:
Me and my baby
My baby and me
We're 'bout as happy
As babies can be
What if I find
That I'm caught in a storm?
I don't care
My baby's there
And baby's bound to keep me warm
We're sticking together
And ain't we got fun
So much together
You'd count us as one
Tell old man, worry, to go climb a tree
'Cause I've got my baby
My sweet little baby
Look at my baby and me

Mary Sunshine:
I don't see how you could possibly delay the trial another 
second, Mr. Flynn. My readers wouldn't stand for it. The 
poor child! To have her baby born in a jail!

Billy:
I can assure you she'll come to trial at the earliest possible moment. 
And you can quote me on that.

Amos:
Hey, everybody. I'm the father! I'm the father!

All:
Yuk! Yuk! Yuk! Yuk!

Roxie:
Looka my baby
My baby and me
A dream of a duo
Now, don't you agree?
Why keep it mum
When there's nothing to hide?
And what I feel
I must reveal
Is more than I can keep inside
Let me assure you
It won't go away
I can assure you
It grows every day
I was a one once
But now I'm a "we"
'Cause I got my baby
My dear little baby
Look at my baby and me

Matron:
I think it's sweet. First time we ever had one of our girls knocked up.

Billy:
I've got it and it's brilliant. I'm gonna get Amos to divorce 
you. That way all the sympathy will go to you - not him. 
You'll be the poor, little deserted mother-to-be and that 
crumb is running out on you.

Amos:
That's my kid! That's my kid!

Roxie and Boys:
Looka my baby
My baby and me
Facing the world 
Optimistically
Nothing can stop us
So nobody try
'Cause baby's rough
And full of stuff
And incidentally, so am I!
(Baby dance break.)
Get out of our way, folks
And give us some room
Watch how we bubble
And blossom and bloom
Life was a prison
But we got the key
Me and my baby
My dear little baby
My cute little baby 
My sweet little baby
My fat little baby
My soft little baby
My pink little baby 
My bald little baby
Looka, my baby and me

Amos:
I'm the father! Papa! Dada! Did you hear me? Did you? 
No, you didn't hear me. That's the story of my life. 
Nobody ever knows I'm around. Nobody. Not even my 
parents noticed me. One day I went to school and when 
I came home, they moved.

Mr. Cellophane       
            Amos:
If someone stood up in a crowd
And raised his voice up way out loud
And waved his arm and shook his leg
You'd notice him

If someone in the movie show
Yelled "Fire in the second row
This whole place is a powder keg!"
You'd notice him

And even without clucking like a hen
Everyone gets noticed, now and then,
Unless, of course, that personage should be
Invisible, inconsequential me!

Cellophane
Mister Cellophane
Shoulda been my name
Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me
And never know I'm there...

I tell ya
Cellophane
Mister Cellophane
Shoulda been my name
Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me
And never know I'm there...

Suppose you was a little cat
Residin' in a person's flat
Who fed you fish and scratched your ears?
You'd notice him

Suppose you was a woman, wed
And sleepin' in a double bed
Beside one man, for seven years
You'd notice him

A human being's made of more than air
With all that bulk, you're bound to see him there
Unless that human bein' next to you
Is unimpressive, undistinguished
You know who...

Cellophane
Mister Cellophane
Shoulda been my name
Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me
And never know I'm there...
I tell ya
Cellophane
Mister Cellophane
Shoulda been my name
Mister Cellophane
'Cause you can look right through me
Walk right by me
And never know I'm there
Never even know I'm there.

Hope I didn't take up too much of your time.

            Velma:
Billy, I been thinkin' a lot about my trial. Couldn't I just 
show you what I thought I might do on the witness stand?

Billy:
Go ahead.

Velma:
Good! Hit it!
Well then, when I got on the stand I thought I'd take a peek 
at the jury. Then I'd cross my legs like this, you know.

Quartette:
When Velma takes the stand

Velma:
Then, when Harrison cross examines me, I thought I'd give 'em 
this...and then if he yells at me I thought I'd tremble like 
this..."ooh, no, please stop!"

Quartette:
When Velma takes the stand
Look at little Vel
See her give 'em hell
When she turns it on
Ain't she doin' grand?
She's got 'em eating out of the palm of her hand!

Velma:
Then, I thought I'd let it all be too much for me, like real 
dramatic. Then, I thought I'd get thirsty and say, "Please, 
someone, could I have a glass of water?"

Quartette::
When Velma takes the stand
See that Kelly girl
Make that jury whirl
When she turns it on
She's gonna get 'em goin'
'Till she's got 'em gone

Velma:
Ah! Ah! Ah! Then, I thought I'd cry. Buckets. Only I don't 
have handkerchief - that's when I have to ask you for yours! 
I really like that part. Don't you? Then, I get up and try to
walk; oh, but I'm too weak, and I slump and I slump and I 
slump and I slump until finally, I faint!

Quartette:
When she rolls her eyes
Watch her take the prize
When Velma takes the stand!
