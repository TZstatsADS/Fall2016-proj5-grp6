            CHORUS
Wrap your feet in Price and Son
Our work is tried and true
Practical, Pragmatical
Steadfast and Steady Too (Steady Too)
If you stroll or saunter and/or bike, jog, hike or run
The prudent shoe for you to choose is
Price and Son

MR. PRICE
You might think beauty comes in spring and sparrow
When the sun rise, itâs the morning dew
But if you walk the straight and narrow
Youâll find the elegance and comfort is aâ
Do you know what the most beautiful thing in the world is Charlie?

MR. PRICE
Charlie, itâs beautiful

For generations have paved the way before you
Youâll be next in line when my time is through
And thereâs a saying handed down Iâve found of value
That you can tell about the fella from his

YOUNG LOLA

Or bravely soaring up into the blue
Just like a rocket looks with sparks and fire
Feels like the magic never ends inside these

UNKNOWN
Take those things off your feet and get inside here stupid boy!

NICOLA
Charlie, here are the shoes I told you about! Come have a look-see!
Arenât they the most necessary things ever? 
If you want to slip a ring on my finger, youâll first slip these shoes on my feet.

CHARLIE
Itâs a tad posh for life in North Hampton, wouldnât you say?

NICOLA
Then good thing weâre moving to London! 
And wonât they make a fittin farewell to the stink of cattle farms and tanin leather? 
Oh we may have been born in a small factory town, 
But we sure as hell donât have to die there!

CHARLIE
You see the price? Thereâs three months rent!

NICOLA
Pinch or pay for em, that is up to you, but these shoes are in my future!

To new beginnings
Hello to sunny days
Weâre upward mobile now
Goodbye to small town ways
Till itâs impossible to find
a trace of what we left behind
And a defining element is in these
Shoes!

NICOLA AND CHORUS
The most beautiful thing in the world!
The most beautiful thing in the world,

Your life, your future, is right here at this factory! You belong here!

CHARLIE
No Dad, I belong with Nicola in London.

MR. PRICE
No, you belong here.

CHARLIE
Will you toast my journey?

MR. PRICE
But to leave your home and family for a job shopping in London!


CHARLIE
Marketing, Dad. 
Richard Bailey has offered Nicola and me positions marketing real estate.

MR. PRICE
Youâre breaking my heart, Charlie.

CHARLIE
To you, Dad.

MR. PRICE
Shoes can protect a manâs journey, but only his heart can choose the path. 
And so a toast to our own Charlie. 
May you never fail to point your shoes back home.

            HARRY
Remember the pub where our fathers went
To spend the end of the day?

CHARLIE
Remember the yard behind the pub
Where we would run and play?

HARRY

CHARLIE
You'd always say that one of these days
You'd get out of Northampton town

HARRY

CHARLIE
Never knew what I wanted before

Sometimes, you've got to re-write the plot
You've got to take what you've got

CHARLIE
Everybodys telling me what I need to be
Change with the times, move to London town
Or live out a legacy
Well, maybe this time, Ill take a chance
Leap into the vast expanse
Maybe this time, Ill seize my destiny

Land of Lola       
            Leave expectations at the door
Just let your eyes explore
My cinematic flair
From my boot to derriÃ¨re

I've got a lacy silken feel
With arms as hard as steel
I am freedom, I'm constriction
A potpourri of contradiction

Once you walk inside these doors you're mine
Now let me blow your mind.

Charlie's Soliloquy       
            Charlie:
Do I belong here?
Am I what's wrong here?
Know what I'm doing?
Or am I a fraud?
Do I fit in?
Where do I begin?
Same old Charlie,
Frightened and flawed.
So, I pretend
and keep my head up like I
Know how this will end.

Maybe these pieces
Are falling together.
Making me feel like
I'm not alone.
Punching holes
Into this leather
This kind'a feels like
I'm back home.

I'm watching myself
And I know what to do.
Hey look at me now
It's a shoe.

Step One       
            This is time for a shake-up,
Look at me wake up, taking control.
This is a new beginning, my gears are spinning,
Letâs rockânâroll.
Just put.  One foot. Onward and forward.
I used to be a zero but now I clearly feel that
I may be the hero who reinvents the heel.
I may be facing the impossible,
I may be chasing after miracles.
And there may be the steepest mountain to overcome.
But this is step one.
Yeah this is step one.
Who knew I had it in me,
Let me begin, see where this could go.
Iâve got knowledge and know how,
Donât stop the show now,
Donât stop the flow.
Just put. One foot. Onward and forward.
I used to live in limbo never dying to begin.
But now itâs sink or swim, so Iâd better dive right in.
I may be facing the impossible,
I may be chasing after miracles.
And there may be the steepest mountain to overcome.
But this is step one.
Itâs not just a factory. This is my family.
No oneâs gonna shut us down.
Not  while Charlie Price is around.
We may be facing the impossible,
We may be chasing after miracles.
And there may be the steepest mountain to overcome.
We may be facing the impossible,
We may be chasing after miracles.
And there may be the steepest mountain to overcome.
But this is step one.
Look what Charlie Boy has done.
This is step one.

Sex Is In The Heel       
            The sex is in the heel
even if you break it
The sex is in the feel
Honey, you can't fake it
Jack it up 'cause I'm no flat tire
Mack it up six inches higher
The sex is in the heel
so just embrace it

stilettos are an "ism"
in red and neon light
Gimme Jimmy Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo Choo shoes
in New York, Paris, encore
Live it like an "ism"
Seduction at the thigh
The heel is the transmission

The sex is in the heel
fierce as you can make it
The sex is the appeal
Kinky boys can shake it
Funk it up till it's ostentatious
Dress it up, it feels contagious
The sex is in the heel
so just embrace it

From London to Milan

Red's the color of panic, passion
Burgundy's the color of allergic reaction
It's not Shlomo, it's Manolo
La dolce vita at the go-go
Kinky boots with lots of swagger
It's high-heeled heaven with a dagger

The History of Wrong Guys       
            LAUREN:
Oh, no. You don't dare. Girl, girl, girl. I\'m warning you! No! 
I think I have a crush. I can't. I think I\'m falling for him.

Oh, no.
Why not?

Women have been making bad choices
Since the beginning of time.
Are you gonna be another one of mine? Ohh

Used to think you were from outer space
Who\'s that bright-eyed guy in your place?
You\'re kind of cute
When you're not so shy.
Oh.

But I've been here before
Have I come back for more?
Another chapter in the history of wrong guys
You used to be so "eh"
A limp lackluster bore
But now you\re changing into
Something I just can't ignore.

Charlie, honestly
I`ve been hurt like this before
Is there really more to you
Then I always thought?
How can you surprise me anymore?
Oh. Oh. Oh.

He's got a girlfriend, you flake. 
Why are they only nice when they are unavailable?

Don't want to be another star-crosses lover.
We all know how that ends.
I'm better off without him
We're better off as friends.
But I've been here before
Have I come back for more?

Another chapter in the history of wrong guys.
Yesterday no spark
No heart aching allure
But today I'm feeling
Something I just can't ignore.

Charlie, honestly
Iv\'e been hurt like this before
Oh. Oh. Oh.

The history of wrong guys:
Chapter one - he's a bum
Two - he's not into you
Three - he's a sleaze
Four- loves the girl next door
Five- loves the boy next door
Six - don't love you no more
-makes you insecure
-makes you so unsure
-is so immature
-loves his mother more
-or...
... has a girlfriend named Nicola

Charlie, honestly
I've been hurt like this before
I can see there's more to you
Than what I always thought
But I won't be burned anymore
Oh, oh, oh

TRISH:
Where you off to?

LAUREN:
I been exec-utized.

Not My Father's Son       
            When i was just a kid
Everything i did, was to be like him
Under my skin
My father always thought
If i was strong and fought
Not like some albatross, id begin
To fit in


Look at me powerless and holding my breath
Trying hard to repress what scared him to death
It was not that easy to be his type of man
To breathe freely was not in his plan
And the best part of me
Is what he wouldn't see

I'm not my fathers son
I'm not the image of what he dreamed of
With the strength of sparta and the patience of job
Still couldn't be the one
To echo what he'd done
And mirror what was not in me

So i jumped in my dreams and found an escape
Maybe i went to extremes of leather and lace
But the world seems brighter 6 inches off the ground
And the air seemed lighter
I was profound and i felt so proud
Just to live out loud

I'm not my fathers son
I'm not image of what he dreamed of
With the strength of sparta and the patience of job
Still couldn't be the one
To echo what he'd done
And mirror what was not
In me

The endless story of expectations wiring inside my mind
Wore me down
I came to a realization and i found a way to turn it around
To see
That i could just be me

(charlie)
I'm not my fathers son
I'm not the image of what he dreamed of

(lola)
With the strength of sparta and the patience of job

(charlie/lola)
Still couldn't be the one
To echo what he'd done
And mirror what was not in me

What a woman wants to see
Stand back, Mr. I-Know-Everything
But it's what you blindly see

What a woman wants
Masculinity	
(What a Man)
Sensitivity
(What a Man)
In a fantasy
(What a Man)
What a woman wants
(What a Man)
A muffin to clutch
(What a Man)

Just a tender touch
You don't get out too much
To know the smoothness of her skin with a gentle caress 
Feel the feathery quality of her dress 
What separates a man like you from a man like me 

I'm a reflection, 
Her protection 
I'm her curious mystery

Look at you divinely dull, drab and dumpy 
A woman wants a man to give as much as she can take 
Just like me A bit of a slob ??????????
Oh piss off

SPOKEN:
Oh I have a challenge for you. 
Write down what you think 
I need to do to be a real man and 
I'll do the same for you. 
Whatever you tell me to do 
I will have to do. 
But you will have to do the same for me.
Deal?

I ain't wearing no poufy dress.
Chickening out already?

Soul of a Man       
            I'm bad news, a black and blues-er
Who's a loser, a merry-go-round spiraling down
I'm all used up, chaffed and chewed up
Who's just screwed up, the same old Charlie hitting the ground

Cause I'll never be the soul of a man, noble and wise
Like the soul of a man who lifted me high
Soul of a man, heroic and true
Like the soul of a man I looked up to
What else could I do

Stupid Hubris, no excuses
I blew my fuses, I guess I'm just a ruse in my fathers shoes
Not amusing, no confusing this streak of losing
Totally brutal and useless too

How can I be the soul of a man, noble and wise
Like the soul of a man who lifted me high
Soul of a man, heroic and true
Like the soul of a man that I looked up to
What else could I

Just when I'm reaching for that rung at the top
On that broken heel steady, ready ready to drop

When will I be the soul of a man, noble and wise
Like the soul of a man who lifted me high
Soul of a man, heroic and true
Like the soul of a man I looked up to
What else could I do

I'll never be, no I'll never be
I have gone and let you down
Whoa, soul, soul of a man
Here comes that familiar sound
Same old Charlie hitting the ground

You don't wanna see me dance.
You can't even take the chance
that it might reflect on you.
You missed out on the best part of me.
The part that made me who I am today.
O, but the best part of me is standing in front of you
and loves you anyway.
Hold me In your heart till you understand.
Hold me In your heart just the way that I am.
With all your faults, I love you.
Don't give up on me.
I wont give up on you.
Well you took my hand, taught me how to be strong
That's where I picked up when we went all wrong.
I know that I hurt you, and you hurt me too,
but you mean more to me, I must mean more to you.
Hold me In your heart till you understand.
Hold me In your heart just the way that I am
With all your faults I love you
I need you to love me that way too.

Raise You Up / Just Be       
            Once I was afraid, but then you came along.
Put your faith in me and I was challenged to be strong.
When I lost my way, you were there to see me through.
Now let Lola lend some love and do the same for you!
Feed your fire, to take you higher.
Weâll light you up like a live wire.
Celebrate you, to elevate you,
when you struggle to step, weâll take a helping hand.
If you hit the dust,
Let me raise you up.
When your bubble busts,
Let me raise you up.
If your glitter rusts,
Let me raise you up. (and up)
Raise you up
Raise you up
Raise you up.
Never put much heart in anything before.
You strut into my life and help me go for something more.
Now I stand up for myself.
Now I stand out from the crowd.
Now Iâm standing on high heels,
If Dad could see me now!
Feed your fire, to take you higher.
Weâll light you up like a live wire.
Celebrate you, to elevate you,
when you struggle to step, weâll take a helping hand.
If you hit the dust,
Let me raise you up.
When your bubble busts,
Let me raise you up.
If your glitter rusts,
Let me raise you up. (and up)
Raise you up
Raise you up
Raise you up.
I knew you had it in you
I knew what you could tell.
You believed in me,
Let me be right for you.
Your stumbling days are done,
Now weâre walking on air.
I was a loose shoe but you need two to make a pair.
Wait wait wait wait hold it right there buster. Are you saying youâd like to take me out?
Yes.
Are you saying you are Nikola are through?
Yes.
Are you saying you are actually available?
Yes.
And you still like girls?
Yes!
Oh. Carry on!
Feed your fire, to take you higher.
Weâll light you up like a live wire.
Celebrate you, to elevate you,
when you struggle to step, weâll take a helping hand.
Look out below,
Here come Don, and Don has brought some friends along.
When you start things out of certainty,
Then the ones you love
Are gonna set you free!
Feed your fire, to take you higher.
Weâll light you up like a live wire.
Celebrate you, to elevate you,
when you struggle to step, weâll take a helping hand.
If you hit the dust,
Let me raise you up.
When your bubble busts,
Let me raise you up.
If your glitter rusts,
Let me raise you up. (and up)
Raise you up
Raise you up
If you hit the dust,
Let me raise you up.
When your bubble busts,
Let me raise you up.
If your glitter rusts,
Let me raise you up. (and up)
Raise you up

Raise you up

Raise you up
Raise you up.
Weâre the same, Charlie Boy, you and me

Who you wanna be.
Never let âem tell you who you ought to be
Just be. With dignity.
Celebrate yourself triumphantly.
Youâll see.
Youâll see.

Ladies, gentlemen, and those who have yet to make up their minds-
As people all over the world clamor for kinky boots, we have to get back to work.
But before we go, we would like to leave you with the Brice and Simon secret to success:
Alright, now weâve all heard of the 12 step program, have we not?
Yes, but what you can do in 12, I want you to know that we all can do in 6 now, and it goes like this:
One: Pursue the truth
Two: Learn something new
Three: Accept yourself and youâll accept others too!
Four: Let love shine
Five: Let pride be your guide
Six: Change the world when you change your mind!
Just be. Who you wanna be.
Never let them tell you who you oughta be.
Just be. With dignity.
Celebrate yourself triumphantly.
Youâll see.
Itâs beautiful.
Youâll see
Itâs beautiful.
Just be.
Itâs beautiful.
Just be.
Youâll see.
Itâs beautiful.
Youâll see
Itâs beautiful.
Just be.
Itâs beautiful.
Just be.
Beautiful.
