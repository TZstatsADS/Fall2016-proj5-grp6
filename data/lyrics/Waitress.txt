What's Inside       
            Sugar, sugar
Sugar, butter
Sugar, butter
Sugar, butter, flour
Sugar, butter, flour
Sugar, butter, flour
Sugar, butter, flour

My hands pluck the things I know that I'll need
I take the sugar and butter from the pantry
I add the flour to begin what I am hoping to start
And then it's down with the recipe
And bake from the heart

Sugar
And butter
And flour
And mother

What's inside?
Everyone wants to know what's inside
And I always tell them but I
Feel more than words can say
You wanna know what's inside?
Simple question, so then what's the answer?
My whole life is in here
In this kitchen baking
What a mess I'm making

Opening Up       
            Cal:
(spoken) jenna! What's the special pie today?

Jenna: 
Uh, deep shit blueberry bacon.

Cal: 
Deep shit?

Jenna: 
Ye- uh, dish! Deep dish. Sorry, cal!

Cal: 
C'mon, girl.

Jenna: 
(sung) the day starts like the rest we've seen
Another carbon copy of an old routine

Becky: 
Days keep coming

Dawn: 
One out, one in

Becky, Dawn, Jenna: 
They keep coming

Cal: 
(spoken) and make the coffee strong enough to chew!

Jenna: 
(sung) i don't know what i wish i had
But there's no time now for thinking things like that
We've got too much to do

Becky, Dawn: 
Too much to do

Jenna, Becky, Dawn:
All these same things
We're always

Opening up
Letting the day in
Over a cup
We'll say "hello, how ya been?"
Looking around
Seeing the same things
Every day brings
"hello, how ya been?"
"thank you, come again!"
Some things never change

Becky:
I wouldn't call this place a happy end
But i been round the block and just came back again
A small town like ours ain't much
But sometimes home is where your ass ends up

Cal:
Order up!

Dawn:
Ordered up is how the day will find me
Everything in its place and time
And i like the way most of the days look exactly the same

Cal:
Order up!

Jenna, Becky, Dawn:
Check the clock
Tick, tick tock

Cal:
Don't stop!
Serve with a smile!

Jenna, Becky, Dawn:
Hurry up, fill the coffee cup
And then in a while
Take a breath when you need to be reminded that with days like these
We can only do the best we can
Till we do it again

Cal:
Come on, move it now!

Jenna, becky, dawn:
Opening up
Letting the day in
Opening up
Some things never change
"hello, how ya been?"
"thank you, come again!"
Some things never change

The Negative       
            Becky:
(spoken) Jenna, time to pee on a stick.

Jenna: 
Wh-? I don't wanna know.

Becky: 
(sung) come on honey, you've waited long enough

Becky, Dawn: 
Get to it and do it!

Jenna:

Dawn: 
I hope you drank enough this morning

Becky: 
Come on, sweetie, it's better to know
We'll be right here with you, so . . .

Dawn: 
It's no or it's yes
But either way you gotta take the test

Becky: 
A squat and a squeeze
A prayer and a please
It's nothing

Dawn: 
A stick and a line

Jenna: 
Just one of 'em, if i'm lucky

Becky, Dawn: 
A pot and a piss
Here we go, sis
And we'll keep our focus on

Jenna, Becky, Dawn: 
The negative!

Becky: 
(spoken) read the instructions.

Dawn:
(read in spanish)

Becky: 
English!

Dawn: 
Do not insert the test stick into your vagina.

Becky: 
Wooooow. Thank you, Dawn.

Jenna: 
(sung) how's i ever get myself in this mess?
One drunk night in that stupid red dress

Dawn: 
(spoken) oh, i love that red dress! The way it sparkles, it looks like an ice skating outfit.

Becky: 
Stay with us, Dawn!

Dawn: 
(sung) maybe his machinery is broken somehow?
What if his boys don't swim?! I mean, wow! (spoken) miraculous luck!

Becky: 
Yeah, miraculous! (sung) to get away with an unprotected f-

Jenna: 
Funny how one night can ruin your whole life

Becky, Dawn: 
Don't go there yet, we don't know what the test says

Jenna: 
I'm already panicked!

Becky: 
(spoken) just calm down, godammit!

Dawn: 
(sung) maybe it'll all be fine

Becky, Dawn: 
Maybe there'll be just one line

Jenna, Becky, Dawn:
Come on, negative!

Dawn: 
(spoken) i thought you don't sleep much with you husband much anymore?

Jenna: 
Well, i - he got me drunk. I do stupid things when i drink, like sleep with my husband.

Becky: 
Honey, we've all made that mistake.

Jenna, Becky, Dawn:
(sung) focus on the negative!

Becky: 
This will all be alright

Dawn: 
It was only one night

Jenna: 
Someone send me a sign

Becky, Dawn: 
One line

Jenna, Becky, Dawn: 
One line

Becky, Dawn: 
That means the test is ready
This is it . . .

Jenna: . . . . Shit.

What Baking Can Do       
            Make it work
Make it easy
Make it clever, craft it into pieces
Make it sweet
Crimp the edges
Or make it sour and serve with lemon wedges
Even doubt
Can be delicious
And it washes off of all the dirty dishes
When it's done
I can smile
It's on someone else's plate for a while

I'll place it on display
And then I'll slice and serve my worries away

I can fix this
I can twist it into sugar, butter covered pieces
Never mind what's underneath it
I have done it before
I'll bake me a door to help me get through
I learned that from you
Mama, it's amazing what baking can do

Make it up
And surprise them
Tell them all my secrets but disguise them
So they dance on the tongue
Of the very people that they're secrets from
Make it soon
Make it better
Though, better never lasts forever
I'll make it small so it fits . . . .

Even this . . .
Even now . . .
Even as the walls come tumbling down
Even as I can't stop remembering how
Every door we ever made, we never once walked out
Something I never got the chance to ask her about

So with flour on my hands
I'll show them all how
Goddamn happy I am
Sugar, butter, flour
Don't let me down!
Let's see the next amazing thing baking does now

When He Sees Me       
            Dawn:
I stick with real things,
Usually facts and figures.
When information's in its place,
I minimize the guessing game.
Guess what?

Jenna/becky:
What?

Dawn:
I don't like guessing games.
Or when i feel things,
Before i know the feelings.
How am i supposed to operate,
If i'm just tossed around by fate?
Like on an unexpected date?

With a stranger who might talk too fast,
Or ask me questions about myself,
Before i've decided that,
He can ask me questions about myself.
He might sit too close.
Or call the waiter by his first name,
Or eat oreos,
But eat the cookie before the cream?
But what scares me the most,
What scares me the most,

Is what if when he sees me, what if he doesn't like it?
What if he runs the other way and i can't hide from it?
What happens then?
If when he knows me, he's only disappointed?
What if i give myself away, to only get it given back?
I couldn't live with that.

So, i'm just fine, inside my shell-shaped mind.
This way i get the best view.
So that when he sees me, i want him to.

Jenna:
Dawn, don't you think you're being a little, i mean maybe just a tad-

Dawn:
I'm not defensive!
I'm simply being cautious.
I can't risk reckless dating,
Due to my miscalculating.
While a certain suitor stands in line,
I've seen in movies,
Most made for television,
You cannot be too careful,
When it comes to sharing your life.
I could end up a miserable wife.

Sorry girls,
But he could be criminal, some sort of psychopath
Who escaped from an institution,
Somewhere where they don't have girls.
He could have masterminded some way to find me.
He could be colorblind.
How untrustworthy is that.
He could be less than kind.
Or even worse he could be very nice, have lovely eyes.
And make me laugh, come out of hiding.
What do i do with that?
Oh, god.

What if when he sees me,
I like him and he knows it?
What if he opens up a door,
And i can't close it?
What happens then?
If when he holds me,
My heart is set in motion,
I'm not prepared for that.
I'm scared of breaking open.
But still i can't help from hoping,
To find someone to talk to,
Who likes the way i am.
Someone who when he sees me,
Wants to again.

It Only Takes a Taste       
            Dr. Pomatter (spoken): 
You know what's kind of funny? 
Just seeing you sitting here all by yourself in your uniform.

Dr. Pomatter (singing): 
You remind me of a girl i once knew.
God, by now she's well in middle age.
Probably 41. 42.

Jenna (spoken):
Huh. Thank you?

Dr. Pomatter (spoken): 
What? Oh my god! No! No! No! No!

Dr. Pomatter: 
She was a waitress at a shop i used to frequent quite a lot.
Nice teeth and small hands
And snuck me goodies i couldn't afford then.
But she was sweet too.
Reminds me of you

Jenna (spoken): 
Hmm. Oh well no one ever really notices me that way so...

Dr. Pomatter (spoken): 
Somebody did right?

Jenna (spoken): 
Hmm?

Dr. Pomatter (spoken): 
Yah, because you have th... The baby.

Dr. Pomatter: 
She'd bake the pies fresh every day

Dr. Pomatter (spoken): 
Like you i guess,

Dr. Pomatter: 
But i must say
If pies were books yours would be shakespeare's letters.
You remind me of her,
But better

It only takes a taste when it's something special.
It only takes a taste when you know it's good.
Sometimes one bite is more than enough
To know you want more of the thing you just got a taste of.

Jenna: that reminds me of a thing we would say.
Me and my mamma in the kitchen when we'd bake.
She's say "jenna, you can tell the whole story with a taste."

Dr. Pomatter (spoken): 
Yah.

Dr. Pomatter: 
No, that's exactly what i mean.
I swear that as those flavors mixed and melted
I could hear the sirens sing.
It was truly something special.
One taste and i want the whole thing.

I must say it felt like i was carried away.
Intoxicated.
Made me escape the room i was in.
I can't help but wonder
How your hand must have felt making that masterful thing.

Jenna: 
Just one bite caused all that wondering.

Dr. Pomatter: 
It only takes a taste

Both: 
It only takes a taste when you know it's good.
Sometimes one bite is more than enough.
To know you want more of the thing you just got a taste of.

You Will Still Be Mine       
            Earl:
Remember my clean shave
Back in our old days
When we would just kiss?
I had my six string,
And you had your own thing
Though i don't remember what it is.
I wrote you love songs,
And you liked that sad one,
So i played it all the time.
What was that one line?
Something 'bout sunshine.
I sang it every night.
"where the sun don't shine."

Earl (spoken): no. That can't be it.

Earl:
"when the sun don't shine."

Earl (spoken): what was it baby?

Jenna:
'Till the sun don't shine
You will still be mine

Earl (spoken): yah, that's right.

Earl:
Man, what a whirlwind?
So much is happ'nin',
And mostly to me.
We've come such a long way.
No turning back now, babe.
You're my family.

Earl (spoken): now, promise me.

Earl:
'Till the end of time
These are ties that bind

Earl (spoken): sing it, honey.

Jenna:
'Till the sun don't shine

Both:
You will still be mine

Earl:
Mine.
Mmm mine.
Mine

A Soft Place to Land       
            Sugar
Sugar, butter, flour
Sometimes I still see her
My mother the dreamer
She'd say, "Nothing's impossible child"

A dream needs believing
To taste like the real thing
Like some stranger you recognize
So pure, so pure, so electric
So sure, so sure, so connected
To those little believers inside
May we all be so lucky

But dreams are elusive
The kind we've gotten used to
Is nothing I can feel
Nothing I can hold
Nothing I can have
Nothing that I know
Dreams come and they go

But hold them and keep them
And know that you need them
When your breaking point's all that you have
A dream is a soft place to land
May we all be so lucky
Sugar, butter, flour

Never Ever Getting Rid of Me       
            I will never let you let me leave
I promise I'm not lying
Go ahead ask anybody who has seen me trying
I'm not going, if it seems like I did
I'm probably waiting outside

Such a stubborn man you'll likely never meet another
When we have our family dinner you can ask my mother
She's the best, learn more about her on our family history test

I'm gonna do this right
Show you I'm not moving
Wherever you go, I won't be far to follow
Oh, I'm gonna love you so
You'll learn what I already know
I love you means you're never, ever, ever getting rid of me
You can try, oh, but I
I love you means you're never, ever, ever getting rid of me

I grew up an only child in a suburb of the city
Spent my days alone my only friend was a stray kitty called Sardine
I though it was hilarious to call a cat a kind of fish
She played hard to get hissing while she scratched me
What she was trying to say was "Ogie come and catch me"
I learned quickly, perserverance stood between a cat and her new best friend, me

Oh, I'm gonna do this right
Show you I'm not moving
Wherever you go, I won't be far to follow
Oh, I'm gonna love you so
You'll learn what I already know
I love you means you're never, ever, ever getting rid of me
You can try, oh, but I

It's a bad idea, me and you
I've never known anything so true
It's a terrible idea, me and you

You have a wife
You have a husband
You're my doctor
You've got a baby coming
It's a bad idea, me and you
Let's just keep kissing til we come to

Heart, stop racing
Let's face it, making mistakes like this will make worse what was already pretty bad
Mind, stop running

It was a pretty good bad idea, wasn't it though?

It's a bad idea, me and you
It's a bad idea, me and you
Hold me close while I think this through

I got a wife
I got a husband
I'm your doctor
My dumb baby's coming
It's a bad idea, me and you
Maybe one more kiss will make us come to

Heart, stop racing
Let's face it, making mistakes like this
will make worse what was already pretty bad
Mind, stop running
It's time we just let this thing go
It was a pretty good bad idea, wasn't it though?

It's not right for me
It's the only thing I've ever done
What if I never see myself ever be anything more
than what I've already become?
I need a bad idea
I need a bad idea
I need a bad idea
I need a bad idea
Just one

Heart, keep racing
Let's make mistakes
Let us say "so what?" and make worse what was already pretty bad
This secret is safe
No reason to throw it away when there's love to be had
Hold me tight as I tell myself that you might make sense
And make good what has been just so bad
Let's see this through
It's a pretty good bad idea
Me and you

I Didn't Plan It       
            Go ahead
Throw your rocks at me
From your little glass house
And then take off running
You're no better than me
We've both made mistakes haven't we

I won't undo what I'm doing
Sit in judgment of what makes us human
I don't claim to be proud
But my head won't be hung in shame

I didn't plan it
But the light turned red, and I ran it
And I'm still standing
It's not what I wanted, but now that it's right here

I understand it
A story written by my own hand
It's life biting right at your heels
I didn't plan it
But it's finally something to feel
Oh

Look around you
Ain't no saints here baby
We're all just looking for a little less crazy
And sometimes it's a hard left turn
Down a road you'd never thought you'd see

I didn't plan it
Taking back what's been taken for granted
'Cause I can't stand it
I'm sick of the way I've been waiting to break free
I needed saving
And a good mistake needed making
Maybe you need the same thing

Something to feel
To race through your blood
And remind you you're here
To open your eyes and look around
And see the sky when you're on the ground

I didn't plan it
But that's life and I'm finally feeling alive
It's not right but it's mine
And it's finally something to feel

You Matter to Me       
            I could find the whole meaning of life in those sad eyes
They've seen things that you never quite say, but I hear
Come out of hiding, I'm right here beside you
And I'll stay there as long as you let me

Because you matter to me
Simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody
You matter to me
I promise you do, you, you matter too
I promise you do, you see?
You matter to me

It's addictive the minute you let yourself think
The things that I say just might matter to someone
All of this time I've been keeping my mind on the running away
And for the first time I think I'd consider the stay

Because you matter to me
Simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody
You matter to me
I promise you do, you, you matter too
I promise you do, you see?
You matter to me

And you matter to me
Simple and plain and not much to ask from somebody
You matter to me
I promise you do, you

You matter too

I promise you do, you, you matter too

Take it from an old man.
Time's just sand slipping past.
We wanna hold it in our hands,
But no one ever sees
What falls through the cracks.
Take it from an old man.
My mistakes have made me,
And i am what i am,
And though i dont believe in silver linings,
I belive there's something in you.
Something good is trying to break through.
You might have to fight the good fight.
And when you think you can't, you can.
Take it from an old man.

Take it from an old man.
The days don't stretch any longer.
They've left tracks upon my skin,

But i believe there's something in you.
Something you should be seeing too.
Let it all on yourself at least one time.

She Used to Be Mine       
            It's not simple to say
That most days I don't recognize me
That these shoes and this apron
That place and it's patrons
Have taken more than I gave them
It's not easy to know
I'm not anything like I used to be
Although it's true
I was never attention's sweet center
I still remember that girl

She's imperfect but she tries
She is good but she lies
She is hard on herself
She is broken and won't ask for help
She is messy but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up
And baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone but she used to be mine

It's not what I asked for
Sometimes life just slips in through a back door
And carves out a person
And makes you believe it's all true
And now I've got you
And you're not what I asked for
If I'm honest I know I would give it all back
For a chance to start over
And rewrite an ending or two
For the girl that I knew

Who'll be reckless just enough
Who'll get hurt but
Who learns how to toughen up when she's bruised
And gets used by a man who can't love
And then she'll get stuck and be scared
Of the life that's inside her
Growing stronger each day
'Til it finally reminds her
To fight just a little
To bring back the fire in her eyes
That's been gone but it used to be mine

Used to be mine
She is messy but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up and baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone but she used to be mine

But i am changed, i am a mother
Oh in an instant
And who i was has disappeared
It doesn't matter, now you're here
So innocent
I was lost for you to find
And now i'm yours and you are mine

Two tiny hands, a pair of eyes
An unsung melody is mine for safekeeping
And i will guard it with my life
I'd hang the moon for it to shine on her sleeping
Starting here and starting now
I can feel the heart of how

Jenna, Becky, Dawn:
Everything changes

Jenna:
I didn't know, but now i see
Sometimes what is, is meant to be
You saved me
My blurry lines, my messy life
Come into focus and in time, maybe
I can heal and i can breathe
'Cause i can feel myself believe

Ensemble:
Everything changes

Jenna and Ensemble:
Oh, my heart's at the wheel now

Jenna:
And all my mistakes
They make sense when i turn them around
Everything changes
What i thought was so permanent fades
In the blink of an eye, there's a new life in front of my face
And i know in due time, every right thing will find its right place
And i swear i'll remember to say we were both born today! Cause everything changed!
Everything changes

Opening Up (Finale)       
            The day starts like the rest I've seen
And all the carbon copy of where I've already been.
Days keep coming one on one, and they keep coming.

Don't know what I wish I had,
But there's no time now,
For thinking things like that.
I've got too much to do (too much to do)
We've got too much to do, too much to do.

Opening up, letting the day in.
Pour you a cup and say, "Hello, how ya been?"
Looking around, seeing the same things.
It's comforting how some things never change.
Never change, never change. Do they?

I wouldn't call this place a happy end,
But I've been 'round the block and just came back again.
Could be worse, so make it work, no place is perfect.

Hey, no good in the outside world,
Because I feel too much and find it usually hurts.
I like the way most of the days look exactly the same.

Opening up, everyday starts
Over a cup, served with, "Hello, how ya been?"
Welcoming in, whatever the day brings
More of the same things.

Check the clock, tick, tick, tock
Don't stop, serve with a smile, hurry up.
Fill the coffee cup, and then in a while,
Take a breath, when you need to be reminded
That days like these, we can only do the best we can.
And do it all again.

It's the heartbeat, the center, the lifeline, you enter.
It's the heartbeat, the center, the lifeline, you enter.
It's the heartbeat, the center, the lifeline, you enter.

Opening up, letting the day in.
Pour you a cup and say, "Hello, how ya been?"
Looking around, seeing the same things.
It's comforting how some things never change.
Never change, never change and never change.

Dear Baby       
            Jenna (spoken):

Dear Baby,
If you ever wanna know the story of how we bought your crib, I'll tell you.
Your crib was bought with the money I was gonna use to buy us a new life.
The Springfield Pie Contest is starting next week and you and I will not be in attendance
