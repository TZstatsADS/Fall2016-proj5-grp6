Tradition       
            [TEVYE]
Tradition, tradition! Tradition!
Tradition, tradition! Tradition!

[TEVYE & PAPAS]
Who, day and night, must scramble for a living,
Feed a wife and children, say his daily prayers?
And who has the right, as master of the house,
To have the final word at home?

The Papa, the Papa! Tradition.
The Papa, the Papa! Tradition.

[GOLDE & MAMAS]
Who must know the way to make a proper home,
A quiet home, a kosher home?
Who must raise the family and run the home,
So Papa's free to read the holy books?

The Mama, the Mama! Tradition!
The Mama, the Mama! Tradition!

[SONS]
At three, I started Hebrew school. At ten, I learned a trade.
I hear they've picked a bride for me. I hope she's pretty.

The son, the son! Tradition!
The son, the son! Tradition!

[DAUGHTERS]
And who does Mama teach to mend and tend and fix,
Preparing me to marry whoever Papa picks?

The daughter, the daughter! Tradition!
The daughter, the daughter! Tradition!

[MATCHMAKER]
Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match.
Find me a find, catch me a catch.
Matchmaker, matchmaker, look through your book
And make me a perfect match.

Matchmaker, matchmaker, I'll bring the veil.
You bring the groom, slender and pale.
Bring me a ring, for I'm longing to be
The envy of all I see.

For Papa, make him a scholar.
For Mama, make him rich as a king.
For me, well, I wouldn't holler
If her were as handsome as anything.

Matchmaker, matchmaker, make me a match.
Find me a find, catch me a catch.
Night after night, in the dark, I'm alone.
So, find me a match of my own.

[TSEITEL]
Hodel, oh Hodel, have I made a match for you.
He's handsome! He's young! All right, he's 62.
But he's a nice man, a good catch. True? True!
I promise you'll be happy. And even if you're not,
There's more to life than that. Don't ask me what!

Chava! I've found him! Will you be a lucky bride!
He's handsome. He's tall! That is, from side to side.
But he's a nice man, a good catch, Right? Right!
You've heard he has a temper. He'll beat you every night.
But only when he's sober- so you're all right!

Did you think you'd get a prince?
Well I do the best I can.
With no dowry, no money, no family background,
Be glad you got a man!

Matchmaker, matchmaker, you know that I'm
Still very young. Please, take your time.
Up to this minute, I've misunderstood
That I could get stuck for good.

Dear Yenta, see that he's gentle.
Remember, you were also a bride.
It's not that I'm sentimental.
It's just that I'm terrified!

Matchmaker, matchmaker, plan me no plans.
I'm in no rush. maybe I've learned
Playing with matches a girl can get burned.
So bring me no ring, groom me no groom,
Find me no find, catch me no catch.
Unless he's a matchless match!

Matchmaker       
            Hodel:
Well, somebody has to arrange the matches,
Young people can't decide these things themselves.

Tzeitel:
Since when are you in a match, Chava?  I thought you had your eye on your books.

(Hodel chuckles)

Tzeitel con't:
And you have your eye on the Rabbi's son.

Hodel:
Well, why not?
We have only one Rabbi and he has only one son.
Why shouldn't I want the best?

Tzeitel:
Because you're a girl from a poor family.
So whatever Yenta brings, you'll take, right?
Of course right!

(throws scarf over her head, imitating Yenta)

Have I made a match for you!

Catch me no catch
Unless he's a matchless match.

If I Were a Rich Man       
            [TEVYE]
"Dear God, you made many, many poor people.
I realize, of course, that it's no shame to be poor.
But it's no great honor either!
So, what would have been so terrible if I had a small fortune?"

If I were a rich man,
Ya ha deedle deedle, bubba bubba deedle deedle dum.
All day long I'd biddy biddy bum.
If I were a wealthy man.
I wouldn't have to work hard.
Ya ha deedle deedle, bubba bubba deedle deedle dum.
If I were a biddy biddy rich,
Yidle-diddle-didle-didle man.

I'd build a big tall house with rooms by the dozen,
Right in the middle of the town.
A fine tin roof with real wooden floors below.
There would be one long staircase just going up,
And one even longer coming down,
And one more leading nowhere, just for show.

I'd fill my yard with chicks and turkeys and geese and ducks
For the town to see and hear.
And each loud "cheep" and "swaqwk" and "honk" and "quack"
Would land like a trumpet on the ear,
As if to say "Here lives a wealthy man."

If I were a rich man,
Ya ha deedle deedle, bubba bubba deedle deedle dum.
All day long I'd biddy biddy bum.
If I were a wealthy man.
I wouldn't have to work hard.
Ya ha deedle deedle, bubba bubba deedle deedle dum.
If I were a biddy biddy rich,
Yidle-diddle-didle-didle man.

I see my wife, my Golde, looking like a rich man's wife
With a proper double-chin.
Supervising meals to her heart's delight.
I see her putting on airs and strutting like a peacock.
Oy, what a happy mood she's in.
Screaming at the servants, day and night.

The most important men in town would come to fawn on me!
They would ask me to advise them,
Like a Solomon the Wise.
"If you please, Reb Tevye..."
"Pardon me, Reb Tevye..."
Posing problems that would cross a rabbi's eyes!
And it won't make one bit of difference if i answer right or wrong.
When you're rich, they think you really know!

If I were rich, I'd have the time that I lack
To sit in the synagogue and pray.
And maybe have a seat by the Eastern wall.
And I'd discuss the holy books with the learned men, several hours every day.
That would be the sweetest thing of all.

If I were a rich man,
Ya ha deedle deedle, bubba bubba deedle deedle dum.
All day long I'd biddy biddy bum.
If I were a wealthy man.
I wouldn't have to work hard.
Ya ha deedle deedle, bubba bubba deedle deedle dum.
Lord who made the lion and the lamb, 
You decreed I should be what I am.
Would it spoil some vast eternal plan? If I were a wealthy man...

Sabbath Prayer       
            [MOTHERS AND FATHERS]
May the Lord protect and defend you.
May He always shield you from shame.
May you come to be
In Israel a shining name.

May you be like Ruth and like Esther.
May you be deserving of praise.
Strengthen them, Oh Lord,
And keep them from the strangers' ways.

May God bless you and grant you long lives.
(May the Lord fulfill our Sabbath prayer for you.)
May God make you good mothers and wives.
(May He send you husbands who will care for you.)

May the Lord protect and defend you.
May the Lord preserve you from pain.
Favor them, Oh Lord, with happiness and peace.
Oh, hear our Sabbath prayer. Amen.

To Life       
            To life! To life! L'chai-im! 
L'chai-im, l'chai-im, to life! 
If you've been lucky, then Monday was No worse than Sunday 
was, 
Drink l'chai-im, to life. 

To life, l'chai-im! 
L'chai-im, l'chai-im, to life! 
One day it's honey and raisin cake, 
Next day a stomach ache, 
Drink L'chai-im, to life! 

Our great men have written words of 
Wisdom to be used 
When hardship must be faced; 
Life obliges us with hardship 
So the words of wisdom 
shouldn't go to waste. 

To us and our good fortune 
Be happy be healthy, long life! 
And if our good fortune never comes 
Here's to whatever comes, 
Drink l'chaim, to life! 

To life, to life, l'chai-im,! 
L'chai-im, l'chai-im, to life! 
Life has a way of confusing us 
Blessing and bruising us, 
Drink l'chaim, to life, 

To life, l'chaim! 
L'chaim, l'chaim, to life! 
A gift we seldom are wise enough 
Ever to prize enough, 
Drink l'chaim, to life! 

God would like us to be joyful 
Even though our hearts lie panting on the floor; 
How much more can we be joyful, 
When there's really something 
To be joyful for. 

To life, to life, L'chai-im! 
L'chai-im, l'chai-im, to life! 
It gives you something to think about, 
Something to drink about, 
Drink l'chai-im, to life! l'chai-im ! 

 the blessing and bruising us part comes first. 

the honey and raisin cake is not in the song at all. 

you forgot the part about there lives being more 
pleasent 

then there future ones. 

This may be a version of "To Life", but it's not the 
version from either the play or the movie. In "Fiddler," 
the song is about the wedding of Tevye's daughter. 

To Life 

Here's to our prosperity, our good health and happiness, 
and most important ... 
To life, to life, la kayim, 
La kayim, la kayim, to life, 
Here's to the father I tried to be, 
Here's to my bride-to-be, 
Drink la kayim, to life, 
To life, la kayim, 
La kayim, la kayim, to life, 
Life has a way of confusing us, 
Blessing and bruising us, 
Drink la kayim, to life! 
God would like us to be joyful, even when our hearts lie 
panting on the floor. 
How much more can we be joyful, when there's really 
something to be joyful for? 
To life, to life, la kayim, 
To Tzeitel, my daughter--my wife, 
It gives you something to think about, 
Something to drink about, 
Drink la kayim, to life! 

(Le Morta! 
Yes, Lazar Wolf? 
Drinks for everyone! 
What's the occasion? 
I'm taking myself a bride! 
Who is it? 
Tevye's eldest, Tzeitel!) 

To Lazar Wolf-- 
To Tevye! 
To Tzeitel, your daughter--my wife! 
May all your futures be pleasant ones, 
Not like our present ones, 
Drink la kayim, to life, 
To life, la kayim, 
La kayim, la kayim, to life, 
It takes a wedding to make us say, 
"Let's live another day," 
Drink la kayim, to life! 
We'll raise a glass and sip a drop of schnapps in honor of 
the great 
good luck that favors you, 
We know that when good fortune favors two such men, it 
stands to reason, 
we deserve it too! 
To us and our good fortune! 
Be happy, be healthy, long life! 
And if our good fortune never comes, 
Here's to whatever comes, 
Drink la kayim, to life! 

Heaven bless you both, to your health and may we live 
together in peace! 
May you both be favored with the future of your choice, 
May you live to see a thousand reasons to rejoice! 

We'll raise a glass and sip a drop of schnapps in honor of 
the great 
good luck that favors you, 
We know that when good fortune favors two such men, it 
stands to reason, 
we deserve it too! 
To us and our good fortune! 
Be happy, be healthy, long life! 
And if our good fortune never comes, 
Here's to whatever comes, 
Drink la kayim, to life!

Tevye's Monologue       
            Tevye: 
They gave each other a pledge. Unheard of, absurd.
You gave each other a pledge? 
Unthinkable. Where do you think you are? 
In Moscow? In Paris? Where do think they are? America? 
And what do you think you're doing?
You stitcher, you nothing! Who do think you are? King Solomon? 
This isn't the way it's done, not here, not now. 
Some things I will not, I cannot, allow. 
Tradtion-Marriages must be arranged by the papa. This should never changed. 
One little time you pull out a prop, and where does it stop? Where does it stop?

Where does it stop? 
Do I still have something to say about my daughter, 
or dosen't anybody have to ask the father any more?

Motel: 
I have wanted to ask you for some time, 
Reb Tevye, but first I wanted to save up for my own sewing machine.

Tevey: 
Stop talking nonsense. You're just a poor tailor.

Motel: 
That's true, Reb Tevey, but even a poor tailor is entitled to some happiness. 
I promise you, Reb Tevey, your daughter will not starve.

Tevey: 
He's beginning to talk like a man. 
But what kind of match would that be, with a poor tailor? 
On the other hand, he's an honest, hard worker. 
On the other hand, he has absolutely nothing. On the other hand,
Things could never get worse for him, they coulud only get better. 
They gave each other a pledge-unheard of, absurd. 
They gave each other a pledge-unthinkable. 
But look at my daughter's face-she loves him, 
She wants him-and look at my daughters eyes, so hopeful.

Tradition!

Well, children, when shall we make the wedding?

Tzeitel: 
Thank you, Papa.

Motel: 
Thank you, Papa.

Tevey: 
Thank you, Papa! Golde! What do I do about Golde? Help!

Miracle of Miracles       
            Wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles-
God took up Daniel once again,
Stood by his and side and- miracle of miracles- 
Walked him through the lions den!

Wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles-
I was afraid that God would frown,
But like he did so long ago, at Jericho,
God just made a wall fall down!

When Moses softened Pharaohs heart, that was a miracle.
When God made the waters of the red sea part, that was a miracle too!
But of all God's miracles large and small,
The most miraculous one of all 
Is that out of a worthless lump of clay,
God has made a man today.

Wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles-
God took the tailor by the hand
Turned him around and- miracle of miracles- Led him to the promised land!

When David slew Goliath (yes!), that was a miracle.
When God gave us manna in the wilderness, that was a miracle too.
But of all God's miracles large and small,
The most miraculous one of all 
Is the one I thought could never be: 
God has given you to me.

Tevye:
AAAh! help help!

Golde:
Tevye? Tevye wake up

(Tevye screams)

What's the matter with you? Why are you howling like that?

Tevye:
Where is she? Where is she?

Golde:
Where is who? What are you talking about?

Tevye:
Fruma Sarah, the butcher's first wife. She was standing there a minute ago!

Golde:
What's the matter with you Tevye? Fruma Sarah's been dead for years! You must have been dreaming. Tell me what
you dreamed and I'll tell you what it meant.

Tevye:
All right, only... don't be frightened! In the beginning I dreamt that we were having a celebration of some kind.
Everybody we knew was there. Musicians too. Suddenly, in comes your grandma Tzietl, may she rest in peace.
Naturally, I went up to greet her, and she said:

A tailor? She must have heard wrong. She meant a butcher.

(sung)
Tevye:
You must have heard wrong Grandma
There's no tailor
You mean the butcher Grandma
By the name of Lazer-Wolfe

Grandma Tzietl:
Noooo! 
I mean a tailor Tevye
My great-grandchild
My little Tzietl who you named for me
Motel's bride was meant to be!

For such a match I prayed
(Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov)
In heaven it was made
(Mazel Tov, Mazel Tov)
A fine upstanding boy
A comfort and a joy
The tailor Motel Camzoil

(spoken)
Golde:
But we announced it already!
We made a bargain with the butcher!

(sung)
Tevye:
But we announced it Grandma
To our neighbors
We made a bargain Grandma
With the butcher Lazer-Wolfe

Grandma Tzietl:
Noooo No!
So you announced it Tevye
That's your headache
And as for Lazer-Wolfe I say to you
Tevye, that's your headache too!

If my grandma Tzietl, may she rest in peace,
Took the time to come all the way from the other world to tell us
About the tailor all I can say is that it's for the best.
And couldn't possibly get any better. Amen.

when did she get to be a beauty,
when did he grow to be so tall?

one season following another,
laiden with happiness and tears.

(tevye)
what words of wisdom can i give them,
how can i help to ease their way?

(golde)
now they must learn from one another,
day by day.

(perchik)
they look so natural together.

(hodel)
just like two newlyweds should be.

Now I Have Everything       
            (Perchik)
I used to tell myself,
That i had everything,
But that was only half true,
I had an aim in life,
And that was eveyrthing,
But now i even have you.

I have,
Something that i would die for,
Something that i would live for too-
Yes!

Now i have everything,
Not only everything, 
I have a little bit more
Besides haviing everything,
I know what everything's for.

I used to wonder "could there be a wife?"
To share such a difficult,
Wand'ring kind of life.

(hodel)
I was only out of sight,
Waiting right here.

(perchik)
Who knows tomorrow where our home will be.

(hodel)
I'll be with you and that's home enough for me.

Everything is right at hand.

Besides having everything, i know what everything's for

Do You Love Me?       
            (Tevye)
"Golde, I have decided to give Perchik permission to become engaged to our daughter, Hodel."

(Golde)
"What??? He's poor! He has nothing, absolutely nothing!"

(Tevye)
"He's a good man, Golde. 
I like him. And what's more important, Hodel likes him. Hodel loves him. 
So what can we do? 
It's a new world... A new world. Love. Golde..."

Do you love me?

(Golde)
Do I what?

(Tevye)
Do you love me?

(Golde)
Do I love you?
With our daughters getting married
And this trouble in the town
You're upset, you're worn out
Go inside, go lie down!
Maybe it's indigestion

(Tevye)
"Golde I'm asking you a question..."

Do you love me?

(Golde)
You're a fool

(Tevye)
"I know..."

But do you love me?

(Golde)
Do I love you? 
For twenty-five years I've washed your clothes
Cooked your meals, cleaned your house
Given you children, milked the cow
After twenty-five years, why talk about love right now?

(Tevye)
Golde, The first time I met you 
Was on our wedding day
I was scared

(Golde)
I was shy

(Tevye)
I was nervous

(Golde)
So was I

(Tevye)
But my father and my mother
Said we'd learn to love each other
And now I'm asking, Golde
Do you love me?

(Golde)
I'm your wife

(Tevye)
"I know..."
But do you love me?

(Golde)
Do I love him?
For twenty-five years I've lived with him
Fought him, starved with him
Twenty-five years my bed is his
If that's not love, what is?

(Tevye)
Then you love me?

(Golde)
I suppose I do

(Tevye)
And I suppose I love you too

(Both)
It change a thing
But even so
After twenty-five years
It's nice to know

 The Rumor        
            (Yente)
"Rifka, I have such news for you"

Remember Perchik, that crazy student?
Remember at the wedding
When Tzeitel married Motel
And Perchik started dancing
With Tevye's daughter Hodel?
Well, I just heard
That Perchik's been arrested, in Kiev

(Others)
No!

(Yente)
Yes!

(Woman 1)
"Shaindel, Shaindel Wait till I tell you."

Remember Perchik, that crazy student?
Remember at the wedding
He danced with Tevye's Hodel
Well, I just heard
That Hodel's been arrested, in Kiev

(Others)
No! terrible, terrible

(Woman 2)
"Mirala."

Do you remember Perchik
That student from Kiev?
Remember how he acted
When Tzeitel married Motel?
Well, I just heard
That Motel's been arrested
For dancing at the wedding

(Others)
No!

(Woman 2)
In Kiev!

(Mendel)
"Rabbi... Rabbi."

Remember Perchik, with all his strange ideas?
Remember Tzeitel's wedding?
Where Tevye danced with Golde
Well, I just heard
That Tevye's been arrested
And Golde's gone to Kiev

(Others)
No!

(Mendel)
God forbid

(Others)
She didn't

(Mendel)
She did

(Avram)
"Terrible news. Terrible."

Remember Perchik
Who started all the trouble
Well, I just heard from someone who should know
That Golde's been arrested
And Hodel's gone to Kiev
Motel studies dancing
And Tevye's acting strange
Shprintze has the measels
And Bielke has the mumps

(Yente)
And that's what comes from men and women dancing!

Far from the Home I Love       
            Far From The Home I Love 
How can I hope to make you understand
Why I do what I do,
Why I must travel to a distant land,
Far from the home I love.
Once I was happily content to be
As I was, where I was,
Close to the people who are close to me,
Here in the home I love.
Who could see that a man could come
Who would change the shape of his dreams.
Helpless now I stand with him,
Watching older dreams grow dim.
Oh, what a melancholy choice this is,
Wanting home, wanting him,
Closing my heart to ev'ry hope but his,
Leaving the home I love,
There where my heart has settled long ago
I must go, I must go, I must go,
Who could imagine I'd be wand'ring so
Far from the home I love
Yet there with my love, I'm home.

How can she think we wouldn't understand
Why she does what she does,
Why she must travel to a distant land,
Far from the home she loves.
Once she was happily content to be
As she was, where she was,
Safe in the bosom to her family,
Here in the home she loves.
Who could see that a man could come
Who would change the shape of my dreams.
Helpless now she stands with him,
Watching older dreams grow dim.
Oh, what a melancholy choice this is,
Wanting home, wanting him,
Closing her heart to ev'ry hope but his,
Leaving the home she loves,
There where her heart has settled long ago
She must go, she must go, she must go,
Who could imagine she'd be wand'ring so
Far from the home she loves
Yet there with her love, she's home.

Anatevka       
            Anatevka, Anatevka
Underfed overworked Anatevka
Where else could sabbath be so sweet?

Anatevka, Anatevka
intimate, obstinate Anatevka
Where I know everyone I meet.

Soon I'll be a stranger in a strange new place
Searching for an old familiar face 
from Anatevka

Anatevka, Anatevka
I belong in Anatevka
Dear little village little town of mine
