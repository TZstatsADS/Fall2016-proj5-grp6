At night when you turn off all the lights
There's no place that you can hide
Oh no, the rhythm is gonna get'cha

In bed, throw the covers on your head
You pretend like you are dead
But I know it
The rhythm is gonna get'cha

Rhythm is gonna get 'cha

Rhythm is gonna get you
The rhythm is gonna get you tonight

No way, you can fight it every day
But no matter what you say
You know it
The rhythm is gonna get'cha

No clue, of what's happening to you
And before this night is throug
Ooh baby
The rhythm is gonna get'cha

O eh, o eh, o eh, oo aah
O eh, o eh, o eh, oo aah

            Anything for you
Though you're not here
Since you said we're through
It seems like years
Time keeps dragging on and on
And forever's been and gone
Still I can't figure what went wrong

I'd still do anything for you
I'll play your game
You hurt me through and through
But you can have your way

I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you
And though you'll never see me cryin'
You know inside I feel like dying

And I'd do anything for you
In spite of it all
I've learned so much from you
You made me strong
But don't you ever think that I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye

I hope you find someone to please you
Someone who'll care and never leave you
But if that someone ever hurts you
You just might need a friend to turn to

And I'd do anything for you
I'll give you up
If that's what I should do
To make you happy

I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care and I don't need you
And though inside I feel like dying
You know you'll never see me cryin'

Don't you ever think that I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right

I See Your Smile       
            I get a little tongue twisted
Every time I talk to you, when I see you
And I'm so glad that you just missed it
The way I stare to memorize your face
To kiss you in my mind
Love you all the time

Cause when I close my eyes
I still can see your smile
Its bright enough to light my life
Out of my darkest hour
Please believe its true
When I tell you I love you

I've taken too many chances
Searching for the truth of love, that's in my heart
Tell me if I've made the wrong advances
Tell me if I've made you feel ashamed

Cause I know I have to do this
Would you hold my hand right through it

Cause when I close my eyes
I still can see your smile
Its bright enough to light my life
Out of my darkest hour
Please believe its true
When I tell you I Love you

Had to let you just what would happen
Yes I had to let you know the truth

I know I've got to do this
Would you hold my hand right through it
Would you
Cause when I close my eyes
I still can see your smile
Its bright enough to light my life
Out of my darkest hour
Cause when I close my eyes
I still can see your smile

Its bright enough to light my life
Out of my darkest hour

You know now this is true
When I tell you I love you

Mi Tierra       
            De mi tierra bella, de mi tierra santa
Oigo ese grito de los tambores
Y los timbales al cumbanchar
Y ese pregon que canta un hermano
Que de su tierra vive lejano
Y que el recuerdo le hace llorar
Una cancion que vive entonando
De su dolor, de su propio llanto
Y se le escucha penar

La tierra te duele, la tierra te da
En medio del alma cuando tu no estas
La tierra te empuja de raiz y cal
La tierra suspira si no te ve mas

La tierra donde naciste no la puedes olvidar
Porque tiene tus raices y lo que dejas atras

La tierra te duele, la tierra te da
En medio del alma cuando tu no estas
La tierra te empuja de raiz y cal
La tierra suspira si no te ve mas

Siguen los pregones, la melancolia
Y cada noche junto a la luna
Sigue el guajiro entonando el son
Y cada calle que va a mi pueblo
Tiene un quejido, tiene un lamento
Tiene nostalgia como su voz
Y esa cancion que sigue entonando
Corre en la sangre y
Sigue llegando
Con mas fuerza al corazon

La tierra te duele, la tierra te da
En medio del alma cuando tu no estas
La tierra te empuja de raiz y cal
La tierra suspira si no te ve mas

Tiene un quejido... !mi tierra!
Tiene un lamento... !mi tierra!
Nunca la olvido... !mi tierra!
La llevo en mi sentimiento, !si senor!
Oigo ese grito... !mi tierra!
Vive el recuerdo... !mi tierra!
Corre en mi sangre... !mi tierra!
La llevo por dentro !como no!
Canto de mi tierra bella y santa
Sufro ese dolor que hay en su alma
Aunque este lejos yo la siento
Y un dia regreso yo lo se

Here We Are       
            Here we are
Face to face
We forget, time and place
Hold me now
Don't let go
Though it hurts and we both know
The time we spent together's gonna fly
And everything you do to me
Is gonna feel so right
Baby when you're loving me
I feel like I could cry
'Cause there's nothing I can do
To keep from loving you
Here we are
All alone
Trembling hearts, beating strong
Reaching out, a breathless kiss
I never thought could feel like this
I want to stop the time from passing by
I wanna close my eyes and feel
Your lips are touching mine
Baby when you're close to me
I want you more each time
And there's nothing I can do
To keep from loving you
There's nothing I can do
I'm helpless in your arms
Oh baby what you do
I'm in love, this is it
There's no turning back this time
No no no
Here we are
Once again
But this time we're only friends
Funny world
Sometimes lies
Become the game, when love's the prize
And though no one knows what's going on inside
And all the love I feel for you
Is something I should hide
When I have you close to me
The feeling's so sublime
That there's nothing I can do
To keep from loving you

When Someone Comes Into Your Life       
            When someone comes into your life
Take a chance, my love
Forget all the pain that's inside
Open up your heart
You'll forget as she's touching
Your face that I once held you
In my embrace
It might even feel right when you
Kiss her goodnight and not me
If someone should hold down her hand
Make her yours, my love
Don't know how long it may last,
Oh, how fast love goes
You'll forget me one day, don't you know

But your memories I'll never let go
I will love you the same as I did that
First day I found you
When someone comes into your life
Never close the door
What you're looking for
Might be in your arms at last
Don't run away
When someone comes into your life
Hold fast
When someone looks into your eyes
Don't refuse their love
You can't live the rest of your life
With a broken heart

You'll forget me one day, don't you know
But your memories I'll never let go
And when love comes to stay
I hope she loves you the way
I love you
When someone comes into your life
Never close the door
What you're looking for
Might be in your arms at last
Don't run away
When someone comes into your life
If someone comes into your life
When someone comes into your life
Hold fast, hold fast

Conga

Do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Come on, shake your body baby,
Do the conga

Don't you fight it till you've tried it
Do the conga beat

Everybody gather 'round now
Let your body feel the heat.
Don't you worry if you can't dance
Let the music move your feet.
It's the rhythm of the island
And like sugarcane, so sweet.
If you want to do the conga
You've got to listen to the beat.

Come on, shake your body baby,
Do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you've tried it
Do the conga beat

Feel the fire of desire
As you dance the night away.
'Cos tonight we're gonna party
Till we see the break of day.
Better get yourself together
And hold on to what you got.
Once the music hits your system
There's no way you're gonna stop.

Come on, shake your body baby,
Do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you've tried it

Get on Your Feet       
            You say I know it's a waste of time
There's no use trying
So scared that life's gonna pass you by
Your spirit dying
Not long ago
I could feel your strenght and your devotion
What was so clear is now overcast
With mixed emotions
Deep in your heart is the answer
Find it, I know it will pull you through

Get on your feet
Get up and make it happen
Get on your feet
Stand up and take some action
Get on your feet
Don't stop before it's over
Get on your feet
The weight is off your shoulder

I think it's true that we've all been through
Some nasty weather
Let's understand that we're here
To handle things together
You gotta keep looking onto tomorrow
There's so much in life
That's meant for you

Get on your feet
Get up and make it happen
Get on your feet
Stand up and take some action
Get on your feet
Don't stop before it's over
Get on your feet
The weight is off your shoulder

Live for Loving You       
            Ooooh, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Lying awake I turn to you as you are softly sleeping.
I think of what I'd like to do while you are
Somewhere dreaming.
I, I feel so happy by your side, oh why, I
Wonder, wonder, wonder why.
Find it hard to find the words to say what
I am feeling.
I'm so in love, I'm so alive and I know you're
The reason, why
Why I'm so crazy (happy) all the time, oh why,
I wonder, wonder, wonder why.

I need nothing else in live than to hold you
I, oh , I am in so deep I don't need no sleep
Just baby you and me.

Baby, I live for loving you, oh la, la, la, la...
Live for loving you, all I wanna do is love you,
Love you

It would never cross my mind to find another lover.
'Cause after having been with you, there could
Be no other.
I, just touching you I'm satisfied, oh why,
I wonder, wonder, wonder why.

You'll Be Mine (Party Time)       
            When the sun is setting in the sky
Everybody knows it's party time
And when the moon is
Rising high
I'll be yours, I know you will be
Mine (party time)

All day the world goes round
& round
You can feel the changes
Coming down
It doesn't matter who you are
With love to give you will go far

We see the treasures all around
And burn ourselves into
The ground
Everyone's is trying to survive
We're not just born to be alive

I know
What I feel inside is true
You know
Every road I follow's leading
Me to you

When the sun is setting in the sky
Everybody knows it's party time
And when the moon is rising high
I'll be yours, I know you'll be mine
(party time)

We live our lives in mystery
While everything is meant to be
No reason here to wonder why
All that we seek is in the sky

You are the one I want to hold
I feel you deep inside my soul
Only our love will set us free
This night belongs to you and me

I know
What I feel inside is true
You know
Every road I follow's leading me to you

When the sun is setting in the sky
Everybody knows it's party time
And when the moon is rising high
I'll be yours, I know you'll be mine

I know, you know
Every road I follow's leading me to you

And when the moon is rising high

Oye Mi Canto       
            Libre... libre para expresar
Lo que siento en el corazon
No tengo que callar

Tienes... esa libertad tambien
Que es dificil de compartir
Y tu lo sabes bien

Hay que buscar la solucion
En vez de decir adios

Alguien tiene que escuchar
Oye este canto que ya va a empezar

Pronto los anos pasaran
Y no quiero un dia despertar
Y ver que es tarde ya

Algo... algo tiene que pasar
Si miramos alrededor
Esta por comenzar

Hablamos de amor... palabra comun
Y no lo ofrecemos nunca

Alguien tiene que escuchar
Oye este canto que ya va a empezar
Someday it'll be alright
Changes happen overnight

Creo en el amor pero sin condiciones
Oye mi canto
Y en ayudarnos sin tener otras razones
Oye mi canto
Los celos y el odio son ya tradiciones
Oye mi canto
Hay que dejarlas atras
No buscar explicaciones

Famous       
            What in this world, feels so alive
Makes us then breaks us
Then helps us survive
Buries our hopes, then revives
Our desire to succeed
We're all greed

Who in this world, see's when i cry
Throws me then shows me
That i'm justified
Measure my worth then decide
That i'm not what they need
They've agreed

Where in this world can i hide
Where can i find
Someone that see's me inside
To confide

How in this world, can i go on
Wondering if you'll think
Of me when i'm gone
Shielding my eyes from
The pityless light of the glare
Should you care

When in this world is it enough
I never thought
It could be quite this rough
Living my life as if
Millions of people don't stare
They're not there

Why should i have to defend
Or derive
Most of the rules of the game,
I've defied
Though it's been hard on my pride
It's been one hell of a ride
Curiously..
I didn't set out to be..

Wrapped       
            I keep every tear like an ocean
For every day that my fortune
Kept me from being with you
I cradle your faith that reveals me
Grows like a flower then heals me
Fills me with promise anew

I carry your worn disillusion
When my pathetic confusion
Kept me from speaking the truth
I'm simply a coin in your fountain
Lost like the seconds I'm counting
Till I am closer to you

I cherish every morning that found us
With the night scattered around us
faded and painting me blue
I carry your joy in my footsteps
Making my way to your harbor
Don't need to go any farther
You are my sun and my moon

Wrapped in your arms where it's a peaceful
Back in your arms where I'm happy
I would do anything gladly
Only to see you again

Wrapped in your arms I can wander
Out to the heavens above me
Hearing you say that you love me
Back in your arms where I'm free

I keep every phrase barely spoken
That from your lips may have broken free
As you give me your love
My yearing in constant and steady
When I'm with you I'm already
Everything I can become

I cherish every morning that found us
With the night scattered around us
faded and painting me blue
I carry your joy in my footsteps
Making my way to your harbor
Don't need to go any farther
You are my sun and my moon

Wrapped in your arms where it's a peaceful
Back in your arms where I'm happy
I would do anything gladly
Only to see you again

Wrapped in your arms I can wander
Out to the heavens above me
Hearing you say that you love me
Back in your arms where I'm free

Wrapped in your arms where it's a peaceful
Back in your arms where I'm happy
I would do anything gladly
Only to see you again

Wrapped in your arms I can wander

Don't Wanna Lose You       
            Sometimes it's hard to make things clear
Or know when to face the truth
And I know that the moment is here
I'll open my heart and show you inside
My love has no pride
I feel with you I've got nothing to hide
So open your eyes and see who I am
And not who you want for me to be
I am only myself, myself

I don't wanna lose you now
We're gonna get through somehow
I don't wanna lose you now or ever
'Cause baby, I've finally found
The courage to stand my ground
But if you want me
I'll be around, Forever

We all make mistakes, We all lose our way
But we stood the test of time and I hope
That's the way it will stay
It's all up to you to tell me to go
'Cause it won't be me to walk away
When you're all that I know
And I know that

I don't wanna lose you now
We're gonna get through somehow

'Cause baby, I've finally found
The courage to stand my ground
But if you want me

Reach       
            Some dreams live on in time forever
Those dreams, you want with all
Your heart

And I'll do whatever it takes
Follow through with the promise I made
Put it all on the line
What I hoped for at last would be mine

If I could reach, higher
Just for one moment touch the sky
From that one moment
In my life
I'm gonna be stronger
Know that I've tried my
Very best
I'd put my spirit to the test
If I could reach

Some days are meant to be
Remembered
Those days we rise above
The stars

So I'll go the distance
This time
Seeing more the higher
I climb
That the more I believe
All the more that this
Dream will be mine

Coming Out of the Dark       
            Why be afraid if I'm not alone
Though life is never easy the rest is unknown
Up to now for me it's been hands against stone
Spent each and every moment
Searching for what to believe

Coming out of the dark, i finally see the light now
It's shining on me
Coming out of the dark I know the love that saved me
You're sharing with me

Starting again is part of the plan
And I'll be so much stronger holding your hand
Step by step I'll make it through I know I can
It may not make it easier but I have felt you
Near all the way

Coming out of the dark, i finally see the light now
It's shining on me
Coming out of the dark I know the love that saved me
You're sharing with me

Forever, forever I stand on the rock of your love
Forever I'll stand on the rock
Forever, forever I stand on the rock of your love
Love is all it takes, no matter what we face

Coming out of the dark, i finally see the light now
It's shining on me
Coming out of the dark I know the love that saved me
You're sharing with me

Mega Mix       
            Doctor I've got this feelin' deep
Inside of me, deep inside of me
I just can't control my feet when
I hear the beat, when I hear the beat
I just don't know, don't know
How I'm gonna deal with you
Doc, Doc, Doc, Doc, Doctor Beat
I just don't know, don't know
Won't you help me Doctor Beat
Doc, Doc, Doc, Doc, Doctor Beat
won't you help me Doctor Beat
Doc, Doc, Doc, Doc, Doctor Beat
Shake Shake Shake your body
Baby Shake Shake Shake Shake your body baby
Shake Shake Shake your body
Baby shake your body baby,
Do the conga
I know you can't control yourself any longer
Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
Don't you fight it till you've tried it
Do the conga beat
Everybody gather 'round now
Let your body feel the heat.
Don't you worry if you can't dance
Let the music move your feet.
At night when you turn off all the lights
There's no place that you can hide
Oh no, the rhythm is gonna get'cha
The rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get'cha
Rhythm is gonna get you
The rhythm is gonna get you tonight
7,6,5,4,3,2,1
1-2-3-4 come on baby say you love me
5-6-7 times
8-9-10-11 I'm just gonna keep on counting
Until you are mine
Get on your feet
Get on your feet
Get up and make it happen
Get on your feet
Get on your feet
You say I know it's a waste of time
There's no use trying
So scared that life's gonna pass you by
Your spirit dying
Deep in your heart is the answer
Find it, I know it will pull you through
Get on your feet
Get on your feet
