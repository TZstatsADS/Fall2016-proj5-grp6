Anybody Have a Map?       
            HEIDI:
Another stellar conversation for the scrapbook
Another stumble as I'm reaching for the right thing to say
It's a mystery at best
And with every second - second guessed
The answers feel lightyears away

See it used to be you'd come to me and solve all the problems
I could scare off any monster
Find Waldo every time
It was Super Mom to the rescue
You thought I knew it all

But I somehow went from bounding over buildings
To searching in the dark
As you became this total question mark
So...

So, does anybody have a map?
Anybody maybe happen to know how the hell to do this?
I don't know if you can tell
But this is me just pretending to know

So where's the map?
I need a clue
'Cause the scary truth is
I'm flying blind
I'm making this up as I go

CYNTHIA:
Another masterful attempt ends with disaster
Pour another cup of coffee
Watch it all crash and burn
It's a puzzle
It's a maze
I've tried to steer through it a million ways
But, each day is another wrong turn

Is there a class that I can take to learn your language?
'Cause I am trying to get with it
I use Google as a verb
Somebody come to the rescue before I'm too far gone

BOTH:
Does anybody have a map?
Anybody maybe happen to know how the hell to do this?
I don't know if you can tell
But this is me just pretending to know

So where's the map?
I need a clue
'Cause the scary truth is

CYNTHIA:
I'm flying blind (I'm flying blind)
I'm flying blind (I'm flying blind)

BOTH:
I'm flying blind
And I'm making this up as I go
As I go

Waving Through a Window       
            I've learned to slam on the brake
Before I even turn the key
Before I make the mistake
Before I lead with the worst of me
Give them no reason to stare
No slipping up if you slip away
So I've got nothing to share
No, I got nothing to say

Step out, step out of the sun
If you keep getting burned
Step out, step out of the sun
Because you've learned, because you've learned

On the outside always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
I'm waving through a window
I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear

While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
I'm waving through a window
Oh, can anybody see, is anybody waving
Back at me?

We start with stars in our eyes
We start believing that we belong
But every sun doesn't rise
And no one tells you where you went wrong

Step out, step out of the sun
If you keep getting burned
Step out, step out of the sun
Because you've learned, because you've learned

On the outside always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been?
'cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
Waving through a window
I try to speak, but nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
Waving through a window
Oh, can anybody see, is anybody waving?

When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
Do you ever really crash, or even make a sound
Did I even make a sound
Did I even make a sound
It's like I never made a sound
Will I ever make a sound?

On the outside always looking in
Will I ever be more than I've always been
'cause I'm tap, tap, tapping on the glass
Waving through a window
I try to speak
But nobody can hear
So I wait around for an answer to appear
While I'm watch, watch, watching people pass
Waving through a window
Can anybody see, is anybody waving back at me?
Oooh, is anybody waving
Waving, waving, whoa-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

For Forever       
            EVAN:
End of May or Early June
This picture perfect afternoon we shared
Drive the winding country road
Grab a scoop at A La Mode
And then we're there

An open field that's framed with trees
We pick a spot and shoot the breeze
Like buddies do

Quoting songs by our favorite bands
Telling jokes no one understands
Except us two
And we talk and take in the view

All we see is sky for forever
Let the world pass by for forever
Feels like we could go on for forever this way
Two friends on a perfect day

We walk a while and we talk about
The things we'll do when we get out of school
Bike the Appalachian trail or
Write a book
Or learn to sail
Wouldn't that be cool

There's nothing that we can't discuss
Like girls we wish would notice us but never do
He looks around and says to me
"There's nowhere else I'd rather be"
I say "me too"

And we talk and take in the view
We just talk and take in the view

All we see is sky for forever
Let the world pass by for forever
Feels like we could go on for forever this way
This way

All we see is light for forever
'Cause the sun shines bright for forever
Life will be all right for forever this way
Two friends on a perfect day

And there he goes
Racing toward the tallest tree
From far across the yellow field I hear him calling "follow me"
And there we go
Wondering how the world might look from up so high

One foot after the other
One branch then to another
I climb higher and higher
I climb until the entire
Sun shines on my face

And I suddenly feel the branch give way
I'm on the ground
My arm goes numb
I look around
And I see him coming to get me
He's coming to get me
And everything's okay

All we see is sky for forever
Let the world pass by for forever
Buddy, you and I for forever this way
This way

All we see is light
'cuz the sun shines bright
Life will be all right for forever this way
Two friends
True friends
On a perfect day

Sincerely, Me       
            CONNOR:
Dear Evan Hansen,
We've been way too out of touch
Things have been crazy and it sucks that we don't talk that much
I should tell you that I think of you each night
I rub my nipples and start moaning with delight

EVAN: (spoken) Why would you write that?

JARED: (spoken) I'm just trying to tell the truth

EVAN:
(spoken) You know what? If you aren't going to take this seriously...

JARED: (spoken) Okay you need to calm yourself!

EVAN: (spoken) This has to be perfect, okay?
The emails have to prove that we were actually friends.
They've got to be completely realistic

JARED: (spoken) There is nothing unrealistic about the love that one man feels for another.

EVAN: (spoken) Let's go back.

JARED: (spoken) In fact, it's something quite beautiful.

EVAN: (spoken) Let's go back Jared!

CONNOR: I've gotta tell you life without you has been hard

JARED: (spoken) Hard?

CONNOR: Has been bad

JARED: (spoken) Bad?

CONNOR: Has been rough

JARED: (spoken) Lame!

CONNOR: And I miss talking about life and other stuff

JARED: (spoken) Very specific

EVAN: (spoken) Shut up

CONNOR: I like my parents

JARED: (spoken) Who says that?

CONNOR:
I love my parents
But each day's another fight
If I stop smoking drugs then everything might be alright

JARED: (spoken) Smoking drugs

EVAN: (spoken) Just fix it!

JARED: (spoken) This isn't realistic at all! It doesn't even sound like Connor!

EVAN: (spoken) Well I want to show that I was a good friend,
Y'know? That I was trying to help him

JARED: (spoken) You are just cute as a freaking button

CONNOR: If I stop smoking crack

EVAN: (spoken) Crack?!

CONNOR:
If I stop smoking pot then everything might be alright
I'll take your advice
I'll try to be more nice
I'll turn it around
Wait and see

Itâs all that it takes
Is a little reinvention
Itâs easy to change if you give it your attention
All you gotta do is just believe you can be who you want 
to be sincerely, me

JARED: (spoken) Are we done yet?

EVAN: (spoken) Well I mean I can't just show them one email

JARED: (spoken) Okay, please stop hyperventilating

EVAN: (spoken) I'm not hyperventilating

JARED: (spoken) You're having considerable trouble breathing

EVAN: (spoken) I'm having no trouble breathing

JARED: (spoken) Do you need a paper bag to breath into?

EVAN: (spoken) I'm not hyperventilating!

EVAN: (sung)
Dear Connor Murphy,
Yes I've also missed our talks
Stop doing drugs
Just try to take deep breaths and go on walks

I'm sending pictures of the most amazing trees

JARED: (spoken) No!

EVAN: You'll be obsessed with all my forest expertise

JARED: (spoken) Ridiculous!

EVAN:
Dude I'm proud of you
Just keep pushing through
You're turning around
I can see

CONNOR: Just wait and see

ALL:
Itâs all that it takes
Is a little reinvention
Itâs easy to change if you give it your attention
All you gotta do is just believe you can be who you want to be sincerely, me

CONNOR: My sister's hot

EVAN: (spoken) What the hell?

JARED: (spoken) My bad

CONNOR: Dear Evan Hansen, thanks for every note you send

EVAN: Dear Connor Murphy, I'm just glad to be your friend

EVAN & CONNOR: Our friendship goes beyond your average kind of bond

But not because we're Gay
No not because we're gay
We're close, but not that way
The only man that I love is my dad

CONNOR: Well anyway

EVAN: You're getting better everyday

CONNOR: I'm getting better everyday

EVAN & CONNOR: We're getting better everyday

ALL: Hey hey hey hey!

Itâs all that it takes
Is a little reinvention
Itâs easy to change if you give it your attention
All you gotta do is just believe you can be who you want to be sincerely,

Miss you dearly

Requiem       
            ZOE:
Why should I play this game of pretend?
Remembering through a secondhand sorrow?
Such a great son and wonderful friend
Oh don't the tears just pour

I can curl up and hide in my room
There in my bed still sobbing tomorrow
I could give in to all of the gloom
But tell me, tell me what for

Why should I have a heavy heart?
Why should I start to break in pieces?
Why should I go and fall apart for you?

Why should I play the grieving girl and
Lie saying that I miss you
And that my world has gone dark without your light
I will sing no requiem tonight

LARRY: (spoken) I'm going to bed

CYNTHIA: (spoken) Come sit with me

LARRY: Cynthia

CYNTHIA: For five minutes?

LARRY: I'm exhausted

CYNTHIA: You know Larry, at some point you're going to have to start-

LARRY: Not tonight. Please. I'll leave the light on for you.

LARRY: (sung)
I gave you the world, you threw it away,
leaving these broken pieces behind you
Everything wasted, nothing to say
So I can sing no requiem

CYNTHIA:
I hear your voice, feel you near
Within these words I finally find you
And now that I know that you are still here
I will sing no requiem tonight

ZOE & LARRY: Why should I have a heavy heart?

ZOE:
Why should I say I'll keep you with me?
Why should I go and fall apart for you?
Why should I play the grieving girl and lie saying that I miss you
And that my world has gone dark without your light
I will sing no requiem
Tonight
'Cuz when the villains fall, the kingdoms never weep
No one lights a candle to remember
No, no one mourns at all
They lay them to sleep
So don't tell me that I didn't have it right
Don't tell me that it wasn't black and white
After all you've put me through, don't say it wasn't true
That you were not the monster that I knew,
'Cuz I cannot play the grieving girl and lie
Saying that I miss you and that my world has gone dark

LARRY: I will sing no requiem

CYNTHIA: I will sing no requiem

ZOE: I will sing no requiem tonight

If I Could Tell Her       
            EVAN:
He said
There's nothing like your smile
Sort of subtle and perfect and real
He said
You never knew how wonderful
That smile could make someone feel

And he knew
Whenever you get bored
You scribble stars on the cuffs of your jeans
And he noticed
That you still fill out the quizzes
that they put in those teen magazines

But he kept it all inside his head
What he saw he left unsaid
And though he wanted to
He couldn't talk to you
He couldn't find the way
But he would always say

If I could tell her
Tell her everything I see
If I could tell her
How she's everything to me
But we're a million worlds apart
And I don't know how I would even start
If I could tell her
If I could tell her

ZOE: (spoken) Did he say anything else?

EVAN: (spoken) About you?

ZOE: Never mind, I don't really care

EVAN: (spoken) No, no, no, he said so many things,
I'm just trying to remember the best ones.

EVAN: He thought
You looked really pretty, er-
It looked pretty cool when you put indigo streaks in your hair

ZOE: (spoken) He did?!

EVAN: And he wondered how you learned to dance
Like all the rest of the world isn't there

But he kept it all inside his head
What he saw he left unsaid

If I could tell her
Tell her everything I see
If I could tell her
How she's everything to me

EVAN & ZOE: But we're a million worlds apart

EVAN: And I don't know how I would even start if I could tell her

If I could tell her
But what do you do
When there's this great divide

ZOE: He just seemed so far away

EVAN:
And what do you do
When the distance is too wide

ZOE: I think I don't know anything

EVAN: And how do you say I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

But we're a million worlds apart
And I don't know how I would even start
If I could tell her
If I could

Disappear       
            CONNOR:
Guys like you and me
We're just the losers
And we keep waiting to be seen, right?
And no one seems to care
Or stops to notice that we're there
So we get lost in the in between

But if you can somehow keep them thinking of him
And make me more than an abandoned memory
That means we matter too
It means someone will see that you are there

No one deserves to be forgotten
No one deserves to fade away
No one should come and go
And have no one know he was ever even here
No one deserves to disappear
To disappear
Disappear

It's true
But even if you've always been that
Barely in the background kind of guy

EVAN: You still matter

CONNOR: And even if you're somebody who can't escape the feeling 
that the world's past you by

EVAN: You still matter

CONNOR:
If you never get around to doing some remarkable thing
That doesn't mean that you're not worth remembering
But the people who need to know

EVAN: They need to know

CONNOR: You need to know

EVAN: I'll show them

CONNOR: That no one deserves to be forgotten

EVAN:
No one deserves to be forgotten
No one deserves to fade away, to fade away

EVAN & CONNOR:
No one should flicker out
Or have any doubt that it matters that they are here

EVAN: No one deserves

CONNOR: No one deserves

EVAN & CONNOR: To disappear, to disappear, to disappear

CONNOR:
When you're falling in a forest and there's nobody around
All you want is somebody to find you
When you're falling in a forest
And when you hit the ground
All you need is somebody to find you

EVAN: No one deserves to be forgotten

EVAN, ALANA & JARED: No one deserves to fade away

CYNTHIA: No one deserves to be forgotten

EVAN, ALANA, JARED & CYNTHIA:
No one deserves to be forgotten
No one should flicker out or have any doubt

No one deserves, no one deserves, no one deserves to be forgotten
No one deserves to disappear

You Will Be Found       
            So maybe let that feeling wash away
Maybe thereâs a reason to believe youâll be okay
âCuz when you donât feel strong enough to stand
You can reach out your hand

And oh, someone will coming running
And I know, theyâll take you home
Even when the dark comes crashing through
when you need a friend to carry you
when youâre broken on the ground
You will be found

So let the sun come streaming in
Cuz youâll reach up and youâll rise again
Lift your head off the ground and look around
You will be found
You will be found
You will be found
You will be found

Thereâs a place where we donât have to be alone
Every time that you call out
Youâre a little less alone
If you only say the word
Across the silence
Your voice is heard

Even when the dark comes crashing through
When you need a friend to carry you
When youâre broken on the ground
You will be found
So let the sun coming streaming in
Cuz youâll reach up and youâll rise again
If you only look around
You will be found
You will be found
You will be found

Out of the shadows, morning is breaking
All is new, all is new

Suddenly I see that
All is new, all is new
You are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone

Even when the dark comes crashing through
And you need someone to carry you
When youâre broken on the ground
You will be found
When the sun comes streaming in
Youâll reach up and youâll rise again
If you only look around
You will be found

To Break In A Glove       
            LARRY:
No one will tell you how to really do it right
That's a secret method only known to very few
So if you need some pointers, just in case you might
Well, then, maybe I could show you what to do

LARRY: (spoken) Shaving cream

EVAN: (spoken) Shaving cream?

LARRY:
You rub that in for about five minutes
And then you tie it all up in rubber bands
Put it under your mattress, and sleep on it
And then the next day, you repeat
And you gotta do it for at least a week, every day, consistently

LARRY: (sung)
And though this method isn't easy
Every second that you spend is gonna pay off
It'll pay off in the end
It just takes a little patience
Takes a little time
A little perseverance
A little uphill climb
You might not think it's worth it
You might begin to doubt
But you can't take any shortcuts
You gotta stick it out
And it's the hard way, but it's the right way
The right way to break in a glove

LARRY: (spoken)
But nowadays, with your generation
I hate to say it, but it's all about instant gratification
Who wants to read a book when you can read the Facebook instead?

EVAN: (spoken) Totally

LARRY: (spoken)
Speaking of instant gratification, I figured we might need it
I mean, only if you want to

EVAN: (spoken) Definitely

LARRY: (sung)
Some people say just use a microwave
Or try that "run it through hot water" technique
Well, they can gloat about the time they saved
'til they gotta buy another glove next week
It just takes a little patience
Takes a little time
A little perseverance
And a little uphill climb
And it's the hard way, but it's the right way
The right way...

There's a right way in everything you do
Keep that grit
Follow through
Even when everyone around you thinks you're crazy
Even when everyone around you lets things go
And if you're prepping for some test
Or if you're miles from some goal
Or you're just trying to do what's best
For a kid who's lost control

You do the hard thing
And that's the right thing
Yeah, that's the right way

Only Us       
            ZOE:
I don't need you to sell me on reasons to want you
I don't need you to search for the proof that I should
You don't have to convince me
You don't have to be scared you're not enough
'Cause what we've got going is good

I don't need more reminders of all that's been broken
I don't need you to fix what I'd rather forget
Clear the slate and start over
Try to quiet the noises in your head
We can't compete with all that

So what if it's us
What if it's us
And only us
And what came before won't count anymore or matter
Can we try that?

What if it's you
And what if it's me
And what if that's all that we need it to be
And the rest of the world falls away
What do you say?

EVAN: I never thought there'd be someone like you who would want me

ZOE: Well...

EVAN:
So I give you ten thousand reasons to not let me go
But if you really see me
If you like me for me and nothing else
Well, that's all that I've wanted for longer that you could possibly know

So it can be us
It can be us
And only us
And what came before won't count anymore or matter
We can try that

EVAN & ZOE: It's not so impossible

EVAN: Nobody else but the two of us here

EVAN & ZOE: 'Cause you're saying it's possible

ZOE: We can just watch the whole world disappear

EVAN & ZOE: 'Til you're the only one I still know how to see

EVAN: It's just you and me

ZOE:
It'll be us
It'll be us
And only us
And what came before won't count anymore

EVAN & ZOE:
We can try that
You and me

Good For You

So you found a place where the grass is greener
And you jumped the fence to the other side
Is it good?
Are they giving you a world I could never provide?

Well I hope you're proud of your big decision
Yeah, I hope it's all that you want and more
Now you're free from the agonizing life you were living before

Say what you need to say
So that you get to walk away
It would kill you to have to stay trapped
When you've got something new
Well I'm sorry you had it rough
I'm sorry I'm not enough
Thank God they rescued you

So you got what you always wanted
So you got your dream come true
Good for you
Good for you, you , you
Got a taste of a life so perfect
So you did what you had to do
Good for you

ALANA: (spoken) Why did Connor kill himself?

EVAN: (spoken) Wait what?

ALANA: (spoken)
He was doing better
That's what he told you in every single email
and then a month later he kills himself?
How does that make sense?

EVAN: (spoken)
Why are you so obsessed with this?
You didn't even know him

ALANA: (spoken) Because it's important!

EVAN: (spoken)
Because he was your lab partner?
Or because, I don't know
Maybe because you want to add another extracurricular for your college application

ALANA: (spoken)
Because I know what it's like to feel invisible, just like Connor!
To feel invisible and alone and like nobody would even notice if you vanished into thin air
I bet you used to know what that felt like, too!

EVAN: (spoken)
We need more emails
Emails showing that he was getting worse
This isn't funny!

JARED: (spoken) Oh I think it's hilarious!
I think everyone would probably think it's hilarious

EVAN: (spoken) What is that supposed to mean?

JARED: (spoken) It means you should remember who your friends are

EVAN: (spoken) I thought the only reason you even talk to me is because of your car insurance?

JARED: (spoken) So?

EVAN: (spoken) So? Maybe the only reason you talk to me, Jared, is because you don't have any other friends!

JARED: (spoken) I could tell everyone everything!

EVAN: (spoken) Great! Go ahead, do it! Tell everyone how you helped write emails pretending to be a kid who killed himself.

JARED: (spoken) Fuck you, Evan! Asshole

ALANA:
Did it cross your mind to be slightly sorry?
Do you even care that you might be wrong?
Was it fun?
Well I hope you had a blast while you dragged me along

JARED:
And you say what you need to say
And you play who you need to play
And if somebody's in your way
Crush them and leave them behind
Well I guess since I'm not of use
Go ahead you can cut me loose
Go ahead now

JARED & ALANA: I won't mind

HEIDI:
I'll shut my mouth and I'll let you go
Is that good for you?
Would that be good for you you you?

HEIDI & ALANA:
I'll just sit back while you run the show
Is that good for you?
Would that be good for you you you?

HEIDI, ALANA & JARED:
I'll shut my mouth and I'll let you go
Is that good for you?
Would that be good for you you you?
I'll just sit back while you run the show
Is that good for you?
Good for you

EVAN:
[?] time to think
but the book is about to sink
Can't erase what I wrote and [?]
Tell me how could you change the story?

EVAN:
Stop it stop it!Just let me go!

ALANA, JARED & HEIDI:
So you got what you always wanted
So you got your dream come true
Good for you
Good for you, you , you
Got a taste of a life so perfect
Now you've changed into someone new
Good for you
Good for you
Good for you
Good for you

So you got what you always wanted

Words Fail       
            EVAN:
So I just stand here sorry
Searching for something to say
Something to say

Words fail, words fail
There's nothing I can say

I guess I thought I could be part of this
I never had this kind of thing before
I never had that perfect girl
who somehow could see the good part of me
And I never had the dad who stuck it out
No corny jokes or baseball gloves
No mom who just was there
'Cause mom was all that she had to be

That's not a worthy explanation
I know there is nothing
Nothing can make sense of all these things I've done

Words fail, words fail
There's nothing I can say
Except sometimes you see everything you want
And sometimes you see everything you wish you had
It's right there, right there, right there
In front of you
And you wanna believe it's true
So you make it true
And you think maybe everybody wants it
And needs it a little bit too

This was just a sad invention
It wasn't real, I know
But we were happy
I guess I couldn't let that go
I guess I couldn't give that up
I guess I wanted to believe it
'Cause if I just believe
Then I don't have to see what's really there

No, I'd rather pretend I'm something better than
These broken parts
Pretend I'm something other than this mess that I am
'Cause then I don't have to look at it
And no one gets to look at it
No one can really see

'Cause I've learned to slam on the brake
Before I even turn the key
Before I make a mistake
Before I lead with the worst of me
I never let them see the worst of me

'Cause what if everyone saw?
What if everyone knew?
Would they like what they saw?
Or would they hate it too?
Will I just keep running away from what's true?

All I ever do is run
So how do I step in
Step into the sun
Step into the sun

So Big/So Small       
            HEIDI:
It was a February day
When your dad before going away
A U-Haul truck in the driveway
The day was suddenly real

I told you not to come outside
But you saw that truck
And you smiled so wide
A real live truck in your driveway
We let you sit behind the wheel
Good-bye, good-bye
Now it's just me and my little guy
And the house felt so big, and I felt so small
The house felt so big, and I felt so small

That night I tucked you into bed
I will never forget how you sat up and said
"Is there another truck coming to our driveway
A truck that will take mommy away?"
And the house felt so big, and I felt so small
The house felt so big, and I knew
There would be moments like this
And I knew
There would be space I couldn't fill
And I knew
I'd come up short a million different ways
And I did
And I do
And I will

But like that February day
I will take your hand, squeeze it tightly and say
There's not another truck in the driveway

Your mom isn't going anywhere
Your mom is staying right here
Your mom isn't going anywhere
Your mom is staying right here
No matter what
I'll be here

When it feels so big
'til it all feels so small
When it feels so big
'til it all feels so small
'til it all feels so small

For Forever (Reprise)       
            EVAN: (spoken)
Dear Evan Hansen,
Today is going to be a good day and here's why
because today, no matter what else, today at least, you're you.
No secrets or lying.
Just you
Maybe someday everything that happened,
Maybe it will all feel like a distant memory.
Maybe ten years from now, no-one will even remember about the Connor Project or me.
They'll just come here and pick apples and enjoy their picnics and that'll be it.

EVAN: (sung)
All we see is sky for forever
Let the world pass by for forever
Feels like we could go on for forever this way
This way

EVAN: (spoken)
Maybe some day some other kid is going to be standing out here, staring at the trees.
Feeling so alone,wondering if the world might look different from all the way up there.
Then maybe he'll start climbing one branch at a time
and he'll keep going, even when it seems like he can't find another foothold.
Even when it feels hopeless, like everything is telling him to just let go.
This time, maybe this time he won't let go.
He'll just hold on.
He'll hold on and he'll keep going.
He'll keep going until he sees the sun.

WHOLE CAST:
All we see is light for forever
(all we see is light for forever)
'cause the sun shines bright for forever
(the sun shines bright)
Life will be alright for forever this way
This way

All we see is light
Watch the sun burn bright
We will be alright for forever this way
All we see is sky for forever

EVAN: All I see is sky for forever
