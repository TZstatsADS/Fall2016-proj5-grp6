Arabian Nights       
            Oh I come from a land, from a faraway place
Where the caravan camels roam
Where they cut off your ear
If they don't like your face
It's barbaric, but hey, it's home }

When the wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west
And the sand in the glass is right
Come on down
Stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly
To another Arabian night

Arabian nights
Like Arabian days
More often than not
Are hotter than hot
In a lot of good ways

Arabian nights
'Neath Arabian moons
A fool off his guard
Could fall and fall hard
Out there on the dunes

One Jump Ahead       
            [Aladdin:] Gotta keep
One jump ahead of the breadline
One swing ahead of the sword
I steal only what I can't afford
( That's Everything! )

One jump ahead of the lawmen
That's all, and that's no joke
These guys don't appreciate I'm broke

[Crowd:] Riffraff! Street rat! Scoundrel! Take that!

[Aladdin:] Just a little snack, guys
[Crowd:] Rip him open, take it back, guys


[Aladdin:] I can take a hint, gotta face the facts
I can use a friend or two!
[Crowd:] True!


Oh it's that Aladdin's hit the bottom.
He's become a one-man rise in crime
I'd blame parents except he hasn't got 'em
[Aladdin:] Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
Tell you all about it when I got the time!

One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom 
Next time gonna use a nom de plume
One jump ahead of the hitmen
One hit ahead of the flock
I think I'll take a stroll around the block

[Crowd:] Stop, thief! Vandal! Outrage! Scandal!

[Aladdin:] Let's not be too hasty
[Lady:] Still I think he's rather tasty
[Aladdin:] Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
Otherwise we'd get along
[Crowd:] Wrong!

[Aladdin:] One jump ahead of the hoofbeats
(Vandal!)
One hop ahead of the hump
(Street rat!)
One trick ahead of disaster
(Scoundrel!)
They're quick, but I'm much faster
(Take that!)
Here goes, better throw my hand in
Wish me happy landin'
All I gotta do is jump

Proud of Your Boy       
            Aladdin
(Spoken) I'm gonna become somebody
I don't know how exactly, but I am
I have to...somehow

(Sung)Proud of your boy 
I'll make you proud of your boy 
Believe me, bad as I've been, Ma 
You're in for a pleasant surprise 

I've wasted time 
I've wasted me 
So say I'm slow for my age 
A late bloomer, Okay, I agree 

That I've been one rotten kid 
Some son, some pride and some joy 
But I'll get over these lousin' up 
Messin' up, screwin' up times 

You'll see, Ma, now comes the better part 
Someone's gonna make good 
Cross his stupid heart 
Make good and finally make you 
Proud of your boy 

Tell me that I've been a louse and loafer 
You won't get a fight here, no ma'am 
Say I'm a goldbrick, a good-off, no good 
But that couldn't be all that I am 

Water flows under the bridge 
Let it pass, let it go 
There's no good reason that you should believe me 
Not yet, I know but... 

Someday and soon 
I'll make you proud of your boy 
Though I can't make myself taller 
Or smarter or handsome or wise 

I'll do my best, what else can I do ? 
Since I wasn't born perfect like Dad or you 
Mom, I will try to 
Try hard to make you 
Proud of your boy

These Palace Walls       
            JASMINE
(Spoken) A princess must say this.
A princess must marry a total stranger, its absurd!

(Sung) Suitors talk of love, but itâs an act 
Merely meant to throw me
How can someone love me when, in fact
They donât know meâ

They want my royal treasure, 
When all is said and done.
Itâs time for a desperate measure
So I wonder

Why shouldnât I fly so far from here?
I know the girl I might become here
Sad and confined
And always locked behind these palace walls

LADY #1
(Spoken) I don't know princess...for someone like you the outside world might be, kinda overwhelming

JASMINE
(Spoken) Is that a promise?

LADY #2
(Spoken) I think it'd do her some good!

JASMINE
(Spoken) You do?

LADY #2
(Spoken) Honey I've never seen somebody who needed to get out more!

LADIES
Told to show devotion every day
And not second guess it

JASMINE
If a new emotion comes my way

LADIES
You suppress it

JASMINE
What would be your suggestion?

LADIES
Stand on your own two feet
And ask why a certain question keeps repeating

JASMINE
Why shouldnât I fly so far from here?
I know the girl I might become here
Follow your heart or you might end up cold and callous

ALL
Love comes to those who go and find it
If you've a dream then stand behind it

JASMINE
Maybe thereâs more beyond these palace walls
What if I dared?
What if I tried?
Am I prepared for whatâs outside?

Why shouldnât I fly so far from here?
Something awaits beyond these palace walls

ALL
Something waits beyond these palace walls

Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim       
            A good pals, blood brothers
Me and three others
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim

Four friends, none closer
Get mad? Heck no, sir!
Not us, four-strong, a permanent team

Four guys out poundin'
The pavements of Agraba
Poor guys with one Alabian dream

To stay this lazy
And play like crazy
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim

True friends, no phonies
Me and my cronies
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim

Four bums, none better
Not one, go-getter
Unmontivated in the extreme

Folks say, "Hey, go earn a living in Agraba!
Grow up, go earn the city's esteem!"
We say, "Tough noogie!
No way! Let's boogie!"
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim

Four guys out passing the turban in Agraba
For lettring off some musical stream
That's our finale

'Kay guys, let's blow this alley
Babkak, Omar, Aladdin and
How's that so far? Not bad!
It's eight eyes with one impermanent gleam

A Million Miles Away       
            [Aladdin:]
(Spoken) Have you ever imagined what it'd be like to take off, and never look back?

[Jasmine:]
(Spoken) Only ever hour of every day

[Aladdin:]
(Spoken) What's stopping us?

(Sung) We'll join a caravan tonight,
Count on the stars to be our guides.
We'll simply vanish out of sight,
Go where the dessert road decides.
There won't be any obligations

[Jasmine:]
Or fathers to obey.

[Aladdin:]
'Cause we'll be a million miles away,
Leave everything behind.
When you choose to loose yourself,
Who knows what you might find.
And once the journeys done,
You'll have some faith in me.
After a million miles or so, 
We might feel like we're free.

[Jasmine:]
Maybe we'll travel on the sea.

[Aladdin:]
Ah ha! I'll tend the sails, and you can steer.

[Jasmine:]
Watch the waves roll on endlessly,

[Aladdin:]
And the horizon disappear.

[Jasmine:]
We'll leave all thoughts about the future,
'Till some future day.  

[Both:]
'Cause we'll be a million miles away,
Leave everything behind.
When you choose to loose yourself,
Who knows what you might find.
And once the journeys done,
It won't seem quite so far.
After a million miles or so,
We'll find out who we are.

[Jasmine:]
Follow wherever the wind starts blowing.

[Aladdin:]
A million miles away.
The kind of a life people dream of knowing.

[Jasmine:]
A million miles away.

[Both:]
We'll never turn back,
Just keep on going.
Vanishing from view,
Becoming someone new.

We'll be a million miles away,
Leave everything behind.
When you choose to loose yourself,
Who knows what you might find.
And once the journeys done,
We'll have no need to roam. 
After a million miles or so,
We might find out we're home.

After a million miles or so,
We might find out we're home.

Diamond in the Rough       
            [Jafar (spoken):] 
You're the one that I need
You're nimble, stealthy, skilled.
Do you want to continue abusing those skills?
Stealing bits of bread and worthless bobbles?
Or do you want to make a name for yourself
And do something that would make any mother proud?

(Sung) You have the profile of a prince
With a physique that matches
Beneath the dirt and patches
You are a diamond in the rough

I say we work together since
You're braver then which you are
We're just as shocked as you are
That you're a diamond in the rough

[Aladdin:]
Hey I'm no diamond in the rough

[Jafar:]
Under the filth and the fleas there are gifts that you've been neglecting
And truth be told you are not quite the guy that we were expecting
And though you might need finesse, and perhaps some... disinfecting
You'll be the one who succeeds when the lamp of their needs collecting

[Aladdin (Spoken):]
Uhhh, I dunno guys, I've got a funny feeling about this.
I better just be on my way.
[Jafar (Spoken):]
Take one step and die you brainless miscreant! 
[Iago (Spoken):]
Happy place!
[Jafar (Spoken):]
Apologies
What I meant to say is

[Jafar:] 
You just don't know how swell you are 
[Iago:]
 You just don't know how swell you are!
[Jafar:] 
So far the only hitch is 
[Iago:] 
There's just an itty bitty hitch
[Jafar:]
You're an embarrassment of riches 
[Iago:] 
Embarrassing? Too true!
[Jafar:] 
You are the diamond in the rough
[Iago:] 
Let's all rejoice the spooky voice and
You're the diamond in the rough!

[Jafar:]
Look here's the diamond in the
[Iago:]
Three cheers, the diamond in the
[Jafar and Iago:]
We found the diamond in the rough!

[Aladdin (Spoken):]
You better find somebody else!
[Jafar (Spoken):]
There is nobody else!
[Iago (Spoken):]
Talk about the girl

[Jafar:]
Oh- Then, of course there's Princess Jasmine
It's clear she took a shying to you
But, let me be frank,
With no cash in the bank,
You'll never win her heart
It just tears me apart
To see her slip right through your fingers

[Aladdin (Spoken):]
Which way is this cave of yours?

[Jafar:]
That a boy!
Go through you!
Might be a bum 
But you're one
Of noble spirit

[Iago:]
It's just a cave that might eat you alive
No need to fear it!

[Aladdin:]
Well it's a risk that I might have to take

[Jafar and Iago:]
We're glad to hear it
[Jafar:]
So please no missteps or blunders
[Iago:]
Cue the Cave of Wonders!
[Jafar and Iago:]
We've waited long enough

[Cave of Wonders (Spoken):]
Who disturbs my slumber?
[Aladdin (Spoken):]
Uhh, it is I, Aladdin
[Cave of Wonders (Spoken):]
You are the diamond in the rough
The one whose worth lies deep within
You may enter
[Aladdin (Spoken):]
I don't believe it
My mother always said if I only applied myself - If I only believed!
[Jafar (Spoken):]
We don't have time for self-discovery!
Fetch me the lamp. Now!
[Aladdin (Spoken):]
Wish me luck!
[Jafar (Spoken):]
Luck!

[Jafar:]
Goodbye you diamond in the
[Iago:]
Please try you diamond in the
[Jafar and Iago:]
Don't die you diamond in the rough

[Jafar:]
At last!

Oh ye people of Agrabah
This is your lucky day

Hail, high and low, great and small
Lucky people of Agrabah,
Someone's coming to call
(Take it away Babkak)

Someone who tamed the cyclops
Then fought forty theives single handed
He's richer than Krisos
He goes where he pleases
And this time he's chosen your land

Oh, oh-woah
Your land
Uh come on!
(Nobody's coming)

So here he is now with his band!

Make way for Prince Ali 
Say hey, hey, hey!

Hey you, let us through!

To meet his eye!

Ring bells! Bang the drums! 
Are you gonna love this guy!

Genuflect, show some respect 
Down on one knee!

Brush up your sunday salaam 
Then come and meet his spectacular coterie 

Prince Ali! 
Mighty is he! 
Ali Ababwa 
Strong as ten regular men, definitely!

He once slew seventy Turks,
Mustaches, Sabres, real jerks!

Ba-badabada
(Hit me one more time)
Ba-badabada
[Over the top] There's no question this Ali's impressive
Ba-badabada
Though, his entourage might be excessive 
Ba-badabada
All those elephants at once can quite unnerve one
Ba-badabada
Still, the man gives a parade new meaning
And the sight of all those peacocks preening
He's a prince without a peer
And we deserve one!

There's no question this Ali's alluring                     Prince Ali, fabulous he
Never ordinary!                                                       Ali Abwabwa

Everything about the man just plain impresses      How can I speak?
He's a winner, he's a wizz                                       I'm weak at the knee
A wonder!                                                                Well get on out in that square 
He's about to put my heart asunder                       Adjust your veil and prepare
And I absolutely love the way he dresses               To gawk and grovel and stare
                                                                                 At Prince Ali!

He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys 
(He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys) 
And to view them he charges no fee 
(He's generous, so generous) 
He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies 
(Proud to work for him) 
They bow to his whim (love serving him)
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali! 
Prince Ali! 

Prince Ali! 
Amorous he!
Ali Ababwa 
Heard your princess was a sight (ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Lovely to see 
And that, good people, is why 
He got dolled up and dropped by 
With sixty elephants, llamas galore 
With his bears and lions 
A brass band and more 
With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers 
His birds that warble on key 
Make way for prince...
Prince Ali! 

Say hey to prince Ali! (Prince Ali) 
Say hey, hey, hey to prince ali!

We'll run away, just you and me
Why not escape as evening falls?
Theres a whole world you've yet to see

High Adventure       
            Convince those guys, my lord and master 
Well, do it faster, let's be gone 
In wasting time we court disaster 
Pick up that sword and strap it on

Fate blows her kiss 
Chills your heart 
Takes your hand

Fate feels like this 
Play your part 
This was planned

And lo, before you know 
You grab your horse, you grab your gear 
Your moment's now, your moment's here

It's time for high adventure 
You're off and riding, sabre flashing 
Your banner high, your molars gnashing

You feel so dashing on a high adventure 
Get set to give some guy a thrashing 
'Cause high adventure's in the air

There's high adventure in the air, guys 
Someone's out there, guys, someone bad 
He's got a damsel in despair, guys 
Heck, that's not fair, guys, and I'm mad

Fate blows her kiss 
Winks her eye 
Plots her scheme 
Plots it for Babkak, Omar, and Kassim

And so 
We three will go 
Until it's through 
Until it ends 
Here comes Aladdin's only friends 
Off on a 
High adventure

To confrontations so exciting 
They're playing music while we're fighting 
Sctatching and biting on a 
High adventure 
Feel that adrenaline igniting 
'Cause high adventure's in the air

adventure 
Heigh-ho, the stallions are stampeding 
With Allah's wisdom ever leading 
My finger's bleeding! Well, that's 
High adventure 
What we've collectively been needing 
Is high adventure in the air

Hark! Something calls like a dream from afar 
Calls out to Babkak, Kassim and Omar 
It's - wait! - the voice of fate 
It calls to me, it calls to you 
And to, Aladdin's muttley crew, 
It's time for high adventure

Danger to danger we go flying 
Completely unafraid of dying 
Omar, stop crying, this is 
High adventure

There's no ignoring or denying 
The kind of thrills that it's supplying 
And the effect's electrifying 
When high adventure's in the air

Somebody's Got Your Back       
            (Genie)
As a Teeny Genie Blue
I would dare to dream
I'd be given freedom free and clear
So forgive me if I sing
Or make a whole big thing
But I just can't maintain my cool veneer

You don't mind if I squeal do you?
(Aladdin)
Be my guest!
(Genie)
Oooooh! I can't believe this is actually happening!
Well

(Aladdin)
You save me
Then I'll save you
I won't bail a 23 Skidoo
Say ain't it great to know somebody's got your back

(Genie)
I'll free you in one second,
I wanna sing this one little verse:
That I owe you
That you owe me
Means we're Ollie Ollie Oxen Free!
Say ain't it great to know that somebody's got your back!

(Both)
Ooooooh!
(Genie)
I always knew that I could trust you kid
(Both)
Ooooooh!
It's squid pro-quo then it's quo-pro-quid!

(Genie)
I knew you'd see that fair is fair
(Aladdin)
Cross my heart and double pinky swear
(Both)
Say ain't it great to know that somebody's got your back
Say ain't it great to know that somebody's got your back!

(Genie)
No, after you
Sure I'll take it

-Music break-

Hello?

(All)
Alright!
Ooooooh!
Without Genie, we don't stand a chance!
Ooooooh!
This is the start of a fine bromance!

Our bond will last like Mutt and Jeff's
OMG the guys are BFFs!
Say ain't it great to know that somebody's got your back!

It's give and take!
It takes some tact
We gonna divvy things up
I down with that
If "Poof, Ka-Blam"
Comes easily
It's part of Genie Genie-ology!

We don't do tricks
Like Genies do
But we got your back
And sing back up too!
Sayin' ain't it great to know that somebody's got your
Ain't it great to know that somebody's got your
Ain't it great to know that somebody's got your
Baaaack!
Got your back!

Doing just what they all do best.
