When I Climb to the Top of Mount Rock       
            I was strumming my axe
in my basement I
With my totally kick-ass band!
When an army of A&R; men will arrive
with pens and contracts in hand!
Then theyâll whisk me away
in a big black car,
and the record accepts
and the girls will PR.
And theyâll know from the start
what a major league star
I will be!
Just wait and see!
When I climb to the top of Mountain Rock!
And there staring down from the heights.
With the crowd at my feet
and a 7 inch bulge
in my lizard skin spandex tights.
Iâll dive on an x rate into a crowd
When theyâre screaming my name out loud.
And the gates will unlock!!!!
At the top of mount rock.
Iâll be blowin out amps
playing stadium shows
Iâm a sold out gonctic tour!
I will blister the ears
of the first thousand rows
And leave while they beg for more!
And iâll pop a champagne
And the party will rage
No brown M&Ms; in my green room backstage.
Bigger than Hendrix, and Clapton, and Page
And the rest!
The all time best!!!!
When I climb to the top of mount rock!
And perched at the uppermost peak.
With a legion of groupies all dukin it out
For my chiseled wreck god physique
And iâll spread hit singles all over the land!
With all of my 12 Grammys in hand
Watch the fan-boys all flock!!!!
At the top of Mount Rock.
All the doubters, and the haters,
and the hipsters, let âem laugh.
Cause theyâll all be beggin for my Roadieâs autograph.
I know my time is comin.
And hopefully itâs comin.
Iâm pretty sure itâs comin any day!!!!
Once they hear me play!!!!!!!!
Then the dreams that I had since the day I turned 10
Will be finally comin true.
And no oneâll ever call me a loser again
Or tell me what I canât do!
So I hold my head high and keep strumming those strings,
And grab any chance that my destiny brings.
And iâll rise, and iâll rise, and iâll rise,
And the wings of my soul!!!!!
Up where I belong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And iâll climb to the top of Mountain Rock!
And be part of that heavenly scene.
With Odin and Zeus on Bass and the drums
And Thor playing tambourine.
When Amus and Jambus and Judas appear!
And Jesus eâll toss me a beer.
And weâll jam âround the clock!!!!
At the top of Mount Rock!
At the top of Mount Rock!
At the top of Mount Rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If Only You Would Listen       
            You always talk, talk, talk all the time.
You never let me get in a word.
I wish i had, i had a dime
For evâry thought iâve swallowed unheard.
No matter what it is that i do,
Itâs like i just canât seem to get through.

Iâve got so much to say,
If only you would listen.
Iâve tried evâry which way,
And still you never listen.
Canât you see iâm hurting?
I couldnât be more clear.
But i promise,
One day iâll make you hear.

You know i try, try, try to explain--
Iâm not the kid you want me to be.
And yet itâs all, itâs all in vain--
You just donât wanna see the real me.
You think you know what iâm all about--
And yet you just keep shutting me out!

Iâve got so much to share,
If only you would listen.
You could prove that you care,
If only you would listen.
Iâm not gonna beg you--
Youâll never see a tear.
But i promise, one day, iâll make you hear.

Yeah, youâll see one day,
Iâm gonna make you hear me.
Gotta find a way,
But you are gonna hear me.
Got so much to say
And iâm gonna make you hear me.

Maybe then youâll listen!
You gotta listen!
You need to listen!
You better listen!

Iâve got so much inside,
If only you would listen!
Joy and anger and pride,
If only you would listen!
Itâs not much iâm asking
I only want your ear.
Yeah, i promise, one day iâll make you hear.
Itâs not much iâm asking,
I only want your ear.

And i promise, one day iâll shake you,
So damn hard that at last iâll wake you,
Yeah, i promise, one day iâll make you hear!

In the End of Time (A Cappella Version)       
            *It starts off...a dark stage and then a beam of light, and you can see me and my guitar*

In the end of time
There was a man who knew the road
And the writing, was written on the stone

*And then a thin layer of fog comes in around my ankles
Roadies that means dry ice we're gonna talk about this later*

In the ancient time
An artist led the way
But no one, seemed to understand

*Chimes, Freddy*

In his heart he knew
The artist must be true
But the legend, of the rent was way past due

*And then Katie you come in with the bass*

Well you think you'll be just fine...without me, but your mine!
You think you can, kick me out of the band

*And then Zach you come in with the face melter*

Well there's just one problem there
The band is mine
How can you kick me out...of what is mine

*And then...Hawaii 5-0, you ever see that show? O.K. well there's a drum solo in there...
Shigadugadugdugadugaduga*

You?re not hardcore
Unless you live hardcore

*And then... that's where I want the back-up singers to be like*

Well you?re not hardcore
(No you?re not hardcore)
Unless you live hardcore
(Unless you live hardcore)
But the legend of the rent was way hardcore

*Boom! Big ol' explosion...some like confetti comes down
Anyway, that's all I got so far, it's a work in progress*

Stick It to the Man       
            When the world has screwed you,
And crushed you in itâs fist.
When the way your treated,
Has got you good and pissed.
There's been one solution,
Since the world began.
Donât just sit and take it,
Stick it to the man.
Rant and rave
and scream and shout.
Get all of your aggression out.
They try to stop you,
let âem know
exactly where they all can go.
And do it just as loudly as you can!
Stick it to the man.
Parents overwork ya,
Stick It To The Man!
Hate The Way They Jerk Ya!
Tired of the system!
Stick it to the man!
Rise up every system!
Stick it to the man!
Break the rules,
Ignore the signs!
And color way outside the line!
Go off the script!
Do what you like!
They hate it, they can take a hike.
And do it just as loudly as you can!!
Stick it to the man!
âIf you're feeling angry,
then put into your music!!!
Failing MP Sessions!
Stick it to the man!
Parents all up in your face yes!?
Stick it to the man!
Bullied for eating good snack foods!
Stick it to the man!
Rock the house and make a scene
And cranks the amps to 17.
And scream until their ears are shot
They all can kiss your you know what.
Do everything they ever tried to ban!!
Stick it to the man!
When the world has screwed you,
And crushed you in itâs fist.
When the way your treated,
Has got you good and pissed.
Thereâs been one solution,
Since the world began.
Donât just sit and take it,
Stick it to the man!
Rant and rave and scream and shout!
Stick your middle finger out!
Just be rude,
And rip your jeans.
And show âem what rebellion means.
Letâs barge in someone elseâs camera van!
Especially those weâre SO much cooler than!
Itâs time to throw some shit against a fan!
There's no way you can stop,
The School Of Rock!!!!!!!!!!!
Stick it to the man!

Where Did the Rock Go?       
            Back when I was younger, wild and bold and free,
I can still remember, how the music used to be.
Chords like rolling thunder, loud beyond control,
Every note and lyric branded right across my soul.

Where did the rock go?
Where's the rush of those electric guitars?
Where are all those voices raised in heaven, 
Blazing down like shooting stars?

Tell me where is the passion?
Where's the rattle and the roar and the buzz?
Where do last year's one-hit-wonders go to?
And what happened to the girl I was?

Somehow I got older, year by busy year.
Guess the songs kept playing, but I didn't stop to hear.
All that youth and swagger turned to grown-up doubt, 
as the world spun like a record, and the music faded out.

Where did the rock go?
Where's the pounding of the drums in my veins?
When did all the static fill the airwaves?
When it's gone, then what remains?

Tell me where did the time go?
Where's the joy I used to know, way back when?
Where's the power and the beauty?
Then the frantic end, the rapture?
Where's the magic of the moments only rock could ever capture?
Now the only thing I'm hearing, are the echoes disappearing.

Sorry for the outburst. Please, I'll be okay.
Let's keep this our secret. Who'd believe it anyway?
We'll pretend it never happened, file it and forget.
Still, thanks for the reminder that there's music in the end.

Where did the rock go?
All those feelings that I learned to ignore?
If you flip the record and start over, does it sound the way it did before?
Where did the rock go?

School Of Rock (Teacher's Pet)       
            Baby, we was makin' straight A's
But we were stuck in a dumb daze
Don't take much to memorize your lies
I feel like I've been hypnotized

And then, that magic man, he come to town.
Woo-Wee! He come n spun my head around
He said "Recess is in session,
Two and two make five."
And now, baby, oh, I'm alive.
Ah Yea! I am alive.

And if you wanna be the teacher's pet
Well, baby, you just better forget it.
Rock got no reason, rock got no rhyme
You better get me to school on time.

Oh, you know I was on the Honor Roll
Got good grades, and got no soul
Raise my hand before I can speak my mind
I've been biting my tongue too many times

And then that magic man took to obey (uh huh)
Do what magic man do, not what magic man say
Now, can I please have the attention of the class.
Today's ass-ignment... (hem hem)
KICK SOME ASS!

And if you wanna be the teacher's pet
Well, baby, you just better forget it.
Rock got no reason, rock got no rhyme
You better get me to school on time.

And if you wanna be the teacher's pet
Well, baby, you just better forget it.
Rock got no reason, rock got no rhyme
You better get me to school on time.

This is my final exam
Now ya'll know who I am
I might not be that perfect son
But ya'll be rockin' when I'm done
