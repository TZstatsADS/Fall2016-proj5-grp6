Alexander Hamilton       
            How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten 
spot in the Caribbean by Providence impoverished in squalor
grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

The Ten dollar, founding father without a father
got a lot farther by working a lot harder
by being a lot smarter by being a self-starter 
by fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter

And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted away 
across the waves he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside he was longing for something to be a part of 
the brother was ready to beg steal borrow or barter

Then a hurricane came and devastation rained 
our man saw his future drip-dripping down the drain 
put a pencil to his temple connected it to his brain
and he wrote his first refrain a testament to his pain

Well the word got around they said this kid is insane man
took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
Get your education don't forget from whence you came. And the world is gonna know your name. 
What's ya name, man?

Alexander Hamilton.
My name is Alexander Hamilton.
And there's a million things I haven't done. 
But just you wait, just you, wait.

When he was 10, his father split
Full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother, bed-ridden
Half-dead, sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick
And Alex got better but his mother went quick

Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride
Somethin' new inside
A voice saying Alex, you gotta fend for yourself
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf

There would've been nothin' left to do
For someone less astute
He would've been dead and destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and other things he can't afford

Scannin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future, see him now as he stands on
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man (x4) In New York (New York)                          Just you wait (x3)

Alexander Hamilton
We are waiting in the weeds for you
You could never back down
You never learned to take your time
Alexander Hamilton
America Sings for you
Do they know what you overcame
Do they know you control your name
The world will never be the same, oh

The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him
Another immigrant comin' up from the bottom
His enemies destroyed his rep, America forgot him

We, fought with him
Me, I died for him
Me, I trusted him
Me, I loved him
And me, I'm the damn fool that shot him
There's a million things I haven't done, but just you wait
Whats ya name man? 
ALEXANDER HAMILTON

Aaron Burr, Sir       
            [COMPANY]
1776. New York City

[HAMILTON]
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

[BURR]
That depends. Whoâs asking?

[HAMILTON]
Oh, well, sure, sir
Iâm Alexander Hamilton, Iâm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

[BURR]
Iâm getting nervous

[HAMILTON]
Sirâ¦
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. Itâs a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

[BURR]
You punched the bursar

[HAMILTON]
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, Iâm not stupid

So howâd you do it? Howâd you graduate so fast?

[BURR]
It was my parentsâ dying wish before they passed

[HAMILTON]
Youâre an orphan. Of course! Iâm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that weâre worth more
Than anyone bargained forâ¦

[BURR]
Can I buy you a drink?

[HAMILTON]
That would be nice

[BURR]
While weâre talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

[HAMILTON]
What?

[BURR]
Smile more

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Donât let them know what youâre against or what youâre for

[HAMILTON]
You canât be serious

[BURR]
You wanna get ahead?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[BURR]
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

[LAURENS]
Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Show time!

[BURR]
â¦like I saidâ¦

[LAURENS]
Show time! Show time! Yo!
Iâm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints oâ Sam Adams, but Iâm workinâ on three, uh!
Those redcoats donât want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till Iâm free!

[LAFAYETTE]
Oui oui, mon ami, je mâappelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say âBonsoir!â
Tell the King âCasse toi!â Whoâs the best?
Câest moi!

[MULLIGAN]
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovinâ it, yes I heard ya mother said âCome again?â

[LAFAYETTE & LAURENS]

Itâs hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsetsâ¦

[LAFAYETTE]
Wow

[LAURENS]
No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Letâs raise a couple moreâ¦

[LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
To the revolution!

[LAURENS]
Well, if it ainât the prodigy of Princeton college!

[MULLIGAN]
Aaron Burr!

[LAURENS]
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

[BURR]
Good luck with that: youâre takinâ a stand
You spit. Iâm âa sit. Weâll see where we land

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Boooo!

[LAURENS]
Burr, the revolutionâs imminent. What do you stall for?

[HAMILTON]
If you stand for nothing, Burr, whatâll you fall for?

[LAURENS]
Ooh
Who are you?	[MULLIGAN]
Ooh

Who are you?	[LAFAYETTE]
Ooh


Who are you?

My Shot       
            [HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, Iâm just like my country
Iâm young, scrappy and hungry
And Iâm not throwing away my shot!
Iâm âa get a scholarship to Kingâs College
I probâly shouldnât brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
Iâm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryinâ to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Evâry burden, evâry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I donât have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, itâs getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am theâ

[HAMILTON/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-Râwe areâmeant to beâ¦

[HAMILTON]
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittinâ on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ainât ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

[LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN/LAURENS]
(He says in parentheses)

[HAMILTON]
Donât be shocked when your histâry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, youâll see my ascendancy

[HAMILTON]
And I am not throwing away
My shot
I am not throwing away
My shot
Hey yo, Iâm just like my country
Iâm young, scrappy and hungry
And Iâm not throwing away my shot

Hey yo, Iâm just like my country
Iâm young, scrappy and hungry
And Iâm not throwing away my shot
Itâs time to take a shot!

[LAFAYETTE]
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to âonarchy?
âOnarchy? How you say, how you say, âanarchy?â
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With myâ

[MULLIGAN]
Yo, Iâm a tailorâs apprentice
And I got yâall knuckleheads in loco parentis
Iâm joining the rebellion cuz I know itâs my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewinâ some pants!
Iâm gonna take aâ

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]

[LAURENS]
But weâll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have anotherâ

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE/MULLIGAN]
Shot!

[BURR]
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
Iâm with you, but the situation is fraught
Youâve got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, youâre gonna get shot!

[HAMILTON]
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Letâs hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callinâ the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppinâ a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkinâ too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that Iâll make yâall proud

[LAURENS]
Letâs get this guy in front of a crowd

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
Whenâs it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it cominâ, do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought Iâd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livinâ fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, thatâs plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, itâs the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claiminâ our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
Is that a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitinâ
But Jesus, between all the bleedinâ ân fightinâ
Iâve been readinâ ân writinâ
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? Whatâs the state of our nation?
Iâm past patiently waitinâ. Iâm passionately
Smashinâ every expectation
Every actionâs an act of creation!
Iâm laughinâ in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, Iâm thinkinâ past tomorrow

you're searching for an urchin that will feed you ideals

Ah, so you've discussed me?
I'm a trust fund baby, you can trust me

I've been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine
Some may say that I'm intense or I'm insane
You want a revolution? I want a revelation!
So, listen to my declaration:
"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal"
And when I meet Thomas Jefferson
I'm a' compel him to include women in the sequel, work!

Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad.
Remember despite our estrangement, I'm your man

You'll be back
Soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back 
Time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise, empire fall

I will send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love

'Cause you're my favorite subject
My sweet submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
For ever
And ever
And ever and ever and ever

You'll be back 
Like before 
I'll fight the fight and win the war
For your love
For your grace  
And I'll love you til my dying days
When you're gone, I'll go mad

[ENSEMBLE]
Here comes the General!

[BURR]
George Washington!

[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, Iâm gonna need a right-hand man.	 
[ENSEMBLE]
What?

What?


Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!



Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!

[WASHINGTON]
Check itâ
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now Iâm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writinâ letters to relatives
Embellishinâ my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons goâ¦

[ENSEMBLE]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people Iâm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look

[WASHINGTON]
We are outgunned

Outmanned

Outnumbered
Outplanned

We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, Iâm gonna need a right-hand man

Incoming!

Theyâre battering down the Battery check the damages

[MULLIGAN]
Rah!

[HAMILTON]
We gotta stop âem and rob âem of their advantages

[MULLIGAN]
Rah!

[HAMILTON]
Letâs take a stand with the stamina God has granted us
Hamilton wonât abandon ship
Yo, letâs steal their cannonsâ

[MULLIGAN]
Shh-boom!	[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray andâ¦

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
Goes the cannon, weâre abandoninâ Kips Bay andâ¦

Thereâs another ship andâ¦

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We just lost the southern tip andâ¦

[COMPANY]
Boom!

[WASHINGTON]
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we canât afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, theyâre skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny:
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
Iâm in dire need of assistanceâ¦

[BURR]
Your excellency, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Who are you?

[BURR]
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

[WASHINGTON]
As you were

[BURR]
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

[WASHINGTON]
Huh

[BURR]
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

[WASHINGTON]
Yes?

[BURR]
Wellâ

[HAMILTON]
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir

[HAMILTON AND BURR]
We keep meeting

[BURR]
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

[WASHINGTON]
Burr?

[BURR]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Close the door on your way out

[HAMILTON]
Have I done something wrong, sir?

[WASHINGTON]
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

[HAMILTON]
Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Donât get me wrong, youâre a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Green and Henry Knox wanted to hire youâ¦

[HAMILTON]
To be their Secretary? I donât think so

[WASHINGTON]
Whyâre you upset?

[HAMILTON]
Iâm notâ

[WASHINGTON]
Itâs alright, you want to fight, youâve got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyinâ like a martyr?

[HAMILTON]
Yes

[WASHINGTON]
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

[HAMILTON]
Why are you telling me this?

[WASHINGTON]
Iâm being honest
Iâm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

[COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON)]
I am not throwinâ away my shot!
I am not throwinâ away my shot!

Scrappy and hungry!

[WASHINGON AND COMPANY]
We are outgunned, outmanned!

[HAMILTON]
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Outnumbered, outplanned!

[HAMILTON]
Weâll need some spies on the inside
Some Kingâs men who might let some things slide

[HAMILTON]
Iâll write to Congress and tell âem we need supplies, you rally the guys, master the element of surprise

Iâll rise above my station, organize your information, âtil we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir!

A Winter's Ball       
            [BURR]
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamiltonâs skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common? Weâre
Reliable with the

Down for the count, and Iâm drowninâ in âem

[ELIZA]
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughinâ at my sister as sheâs dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went âBoom!â
Tryinâ to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybodyâs dancinâ and the bandâs top volume

[ELIZA AND WOMEN]
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine

[ELIZA]
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, âYo, this
Oneâs mine.â

My sister made her way across the room to you
And I got nervous, thinking âWhatâs she gonna do?â
She grabbed you by the arm, Iâm thinkinâ âIâm throughâ
Then you look back at me and suddenly Iâm

I panic for a second, thinking
âweâre throughâ
But then he shakes your hand and says
âBe trueâ
And you turn back to me, smiling, and Iâm

An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I haveâs my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
Weâll get a little place in Harlem and weâll figure it out
Iâve been livinâ without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But Iâll never forget my motherâs face, that was real
And long as Iâm alive, Eliza, swear to God
Youâll never feel soâ¦

Satisfied       
            Angelica:                                 Chorus:
A toast to the groom         (To the groom x3)
To the bride                      (To the Bride x3)
From your sister                  (Angelica x3)
Is always by your side       (By your side x2)
To your union             (To the union) (to the revolution)
And the hope that you provide (Provide, you provide)
May you always                      (Always)
Be satisfied                            (Rewind)

Angelica:
I remember that night I just might regret that night for the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys tripping over themselves to win our praise.
I remember that dreamlike candlelight like a dream that you can't quite place.
But Alexander I'll never forget the first time I saw your face.
I have never been the same.
Intelligent eyes in a hunger pain fame.
And when you said hi I forgot my dang name.
You set my heart aflame, every part aflame, this is not a game. 


Hamilton:
You strike me as a woman who has ever been satisfied.

Angelica:
I'm sure I don't know what you mean you forget yourself.

Hamilton:
You're like me, I'm never satisfied.

Angelica:
Is that right?

Hamilton:
I have never been satisfied

Angelica:
My name is Angelica Schuyler.

Hamilton:
Alexander Hamilton

Angelica:
Where's your family from?

Hamilton:
Unimportant. There's a million things I haven't done. 
But just you wait, just you wait.

Angelica:
So so so so this is what it feels like to match wits with someone at your level.
What the hell is the catch?
It's the feeling of freedom of seeing the light.
It's Ben Franklin with the key and the kite.
You see it right?
The conversation lasted 2 minutes maybe 3 minutes,
Everything we said in total agreement
It's a dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance.
He's a bit of a flirt but I'm-a give it a chance.
I asked about his family, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting he looked he scanned.
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants.
Handsome, boy does he know it.
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it.
I wanna take him far away from this place,
Then I turn to see my sister's face and she is,

Eliza:
Helpless.

Angelica:
And I know she is,

Eliza:
Helpless

Angelica:
And her eyes are just, 

Eliza:
Helpless

Angelica:
And I realize three fundamental truths at the exact same time.

Hamilton:
Where are you taking me?

Angelica:
I'm about to change your life

Hamilton:
Then by all means lead the way.

Angelica:
I'm a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich.
My father has no sons, so I'm the one who has to social climb for one.
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in New York City is insidious 
And Alexander is penniless,
That doesn't mean I want him any less.

Eliza:
Elizabeth Schuyler, it's a pleasure to meet you.

Hamilton:
Schuyler?

Angelica:
My sister.
He's after me cause I'm a Schuyler sister that elevates the status
I'd have to be naive to set that aside.
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza now that's his bride.
Nice going Angelica, he was right you will ever be satisfied.

Eliza:
Thank you for all your service.

Hamilton:
Well if takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have well been worth it.

Angelica:
I'll leave you to it
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind.
If I tell her that I love him, she'd be silently resign,
He'd be mine.
She would say I'm fine.
She'd be lying.

But when I fantasize at night it's Alexander's eyes.
As I romanticize what might have been,
If I hadn't sized him up so quickly.
At least my dear Eliza's his wife.
At least I keep his eyes in my life.

Angelica:                                 Chorus:
To the groom                    (To the groom x3)
To the bride                      (To the Bride x3)
From your sister                  (Angelica x3)
Is always by your side       (By your side x2)
To your union             (To the union) (to the revolution)
And the hope that you provide (Provide, you provide)
May you always                      (Always)
Be satisfied                          (Satisfied x3)

Angelica:
And I know she'll be happy as his bride.
And I know you will be satisfied.
I will never be satisfied.

Youâre very kind, but Iâm afraid itâs unlawful, sir

[HAMILTON]
What do you mean?

[BURR]
Sheâs married

[HAMILTON]
I see

[BURR]
Sheâs married to a British officer

[HAMILTON]
Oh shitâ¦

[BURR]
Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
Iâll see you on the other side of the war

[HAMILTON]
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?

Theodosia writes me a letter everyday
I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it

My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher

Just a legacy to protect

Stay Alive

Stay aliveâ¦

[ELIZA/ANGELICA/ENSEMBLE WOMEN]
Stay aliveâ¦

[HAMILTON]
I have never seen the General so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes, âGeorge, attack the British forces.â
I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence

[WASHINGTON]
The cavalryâs not coming

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
Alex, listen. Thereâs only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright

[HAMILTON]
Thatâs right

[WASHINGTON]
Donât engage, strike by night
Remain relentless âtil their troops take flight

[HAMILTON]
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight

Weâre gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast

[HAMILTON/LAURENS/LAFAYETTE]

[MULLIGAN]
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

[LAFAYETTE]
I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship

[LAURENS]
I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every dayâs a test of our camaraderie
And bravery

[HAMILTON]
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And evâry day
âSir, entrust me with a command,â
And evâry day

[WASHINGTON]
No

[HAMILTON]
He dismisses me out of hand

[HAMILTON]
Instead of me
He promotes
Charles Lee
Makes him second-in-command:	 

[LEE]
Charles Lee.	[ELIZA/ANGELICA]
Stay alive...

[LEE]
Iâm a General. Whee!!!!

[HAMILTON]
Yeah. Heâs not the choice I would have gone with

[WASHINGTON]
Have Lafayette take the lead!

[HAMILTON]
Yes, sir!

[LAURENS]
A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

[LAFAYETTE]
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

[HAMILTON]
Charles Lee was left behind
Without a pot to piss in
He started sayinâ this to anybody who would listen:

[LEE]
Washington cannot be left alone to his devices
Indecisive, from crisis to crisis
The best thing he can do for the revolution
Is turn nâ go back to plantinâ tobacco in Mount Vernon

[COMPANY]
Oo!!

[WASHINGTON]
Donât do a thing. History will prove him wrong

[HAMILTON]
But, sir!

[WASHINGTON]
We have a war to fight, letâs move along

[LAURENS]
Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it

[HAMILTON]
I canât disobey direct orders

Ten Duel Commandments

One, two, three, four

[FULL COMPANY]
Five, six, seven, eight, nineâ¦

[BURR/HAMILTON/LAURENS/LEE]
Itâs the Ten Duel Commandments

[FULL COMPANY]
Itâs the Ten Duel Commandments
Number one!

[LAURENS]
The challenge: demand satisfaction
If they apologize, no need for further action

[COMPANY]
Number two!

[LAURENS]
If they donât, grab a friend, thatâs your second

[HAMILTON]
Your lieutenant when thereâs reckoning to be reckoned

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[LEE]
Have your seconds meet face to face

[BURR]
Negotiate a peaceâ¦

[HAMILTON]
Or negotiate a time and place

[BURR]
This is commonplace, âspecially âtween recruits

[COMPANY]
Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Number four!

[LAURENS]
If they donât reach a peace, thatâs alright
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site

[HAMILTON]
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility

[BURR]
You have him turn around so he can have deniability

[COMPANY]
Five!

[LEE]
Duel before the sun is in the sky

[COMPANY]
Pick a place to die where itâs high and dry
Number six!

[HAMILTON]
Leave a note for your next of kin
Tell âem where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in

[COMPANY]
Seven!

[LEE]
Confess your sins. Ready for the moment of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent

[COMPANY]
Number eight!

[LAURENS/LEE/HAMILTON/BURR]
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straightâ¦

[BURR]
Alexander

[HAMILTON]
Aaron Burr, sir

[BURR]
Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?

[HAMILTON]
Sure
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr

[BURR]
With his life? We both know thatâs absurd, sir

[HAMILTON]
Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?

[BURR]
Okay, so weâre doinâ this

[COMPANY]
Number nine!

[HAMILTON]
Look âem in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count

Without infightingâ

[HAMILTON]
Lee called you out. We called his bluff

You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south

You're absolutely right, John should have shot him in the mouth
That wouldâve shut him up

[WASHINGTON]
Sonâ

[HAMILTON]
Iâm notcha sonâ

[WASHINGTON]
Watch your tone
I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown

Charles Lee, Thomas Conway
These men take your name and they rake it
Through the mud

[WASHINGTON]
My nameâs been through a lot, I can take it

[HAMILTON]
Well, I donât have your name. I donât have your titles
I donât have your land
But, if youâ

[WASHINGTON]
Noâ

[HAMILTON]
If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, I could fly above my station after the war

[WASHINGTON]
Or you could die and we need you alive

[HAMILTON]
Iâm more than willing to dieâ

[WASHINGTON]
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you aliveâ

[HAMILTON]

Unable to provide for your life?

I relish being your wife
Look around, look aroundâ¦

Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that youâre alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough

And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough

I donât pretend to know
The challenges youâre facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind

But Iâm not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough

We donât need a legacy
We donât need money
If I could grant you peace of mind
If you could let me inside your heartâ¦

Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay
And I could be enough
And we could be enough
That would be enough

Yorktown       
            Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down) Lyrics

Choirs:
The Battle of Yorktown.
Seventeen Eighty-one.

Lafayette:
Monsieur Hamilton.

Hamilton:
Monsieur Lafayette.

Lafayette:
In command where you belong.

Hamilton:
Are you saying, 'No Sweat''
We're finally on the field,
We've had quite a run.

Lafayette:
Immigrants' 

Both:
We get the job done!

Hamilton:
So what happens if we win'

Lafayette:
I go back to France.
I bring freedom to me people,
If I'm given the chance.

Hamilton:
We'll be with you when you do.

Lafayette:
Go lead your men.

Hamilton:
I'll see you on the other side.

Lafayette:
'Till we meet again.

Hamilton:
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Yo, I'm just like my country,
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry,
And I am not throwing away my shot!

Choirs:
I am not throwing away my shot!

Hamilton:
('Till the world turns upside down.)

Choirs:
'Till the world turns upside down'

Hamilton:
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory.
This is where it gets me,
On my feet, the enemy ahead of me.
If this is the end of me,
At least I have a friend with me.
Weapon in my head,
In command of my men with me.

Then I remember my Eliza's expecting me,
Not only that, my Eliza's expecting.
You gotta go,
Gotta get the job done,
Gotta start a new nation,
Gotta meet my son.

Get yo bullets out yo guns,
Get yo bullets out yo guns.
We move under cover,
And we move as one.
Through the night we have one shot to live another day.
We can not let a stray gunshot give us away.

We will fight up close,
Seize the moment and stay in it.
It's either that or meet the business end of a bayonet.
The code word is, 'Ro-Sham-Bo.'
Dig me'

Choirs:
Ro-Sham-Bo!

Hamilton:
You have your orders now,
Go man, go!

And so the American experiment begins,
With my friends all scattered to the winds,
Laurens is South Carolina,
Redefining bravery.
We'll never be free until we end slavery.

When we finally drive the British away,
Lafayette is there waiting,
In Chesapeake Bay.

How did we know that this plan would work'
We had a spy on the inside,
That's right: 

Choirs:
Hercules Mulligan!

Mulligan:
Tell I'm spying on the British Government,
I take the measurement information and then I smuggle it,
To my brothers, revolutionary coming in,
I'm running with the sons of liberty and I am loving it!

See that's what happens when you're up against the ruffians.
We in the s*** now,
Somebody gotta shovel it.

Hercules Mulligan,
I need no introduction,
When you knock me down,
I get the f*** back up again!

**Record Scratch Break**

Hamilton:
After a week of fighting,
A young man in a red coat stands on a parapet.

Lafayette:
We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief.

Mulligan:
And just like that it's over,
We tend to our wounded,
We count our dead.

Laurens:
Black and White soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom.

King George:
Not yet.

Hamilton:
We negotiate the terms of surrender.
I see George Washington smile.
We escort their men out of Yorktown.
They stagger home, single file.
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets,
There are screams and church bells ringing.
And as our fallen foes retreat,
I hear the drinking song they're singing.

Choirs:
The world turned upside down.
The world turned upside down.
The world turned upside down.
The world turned upside down, down...
Down, down, down!

Lafayette:
Freedom for America,
Freedom for France!

Choirs:
Down, down, down!

Hamilton:
Gotta start a new nation,
Gotta meet my son!

Choirs:
Down, down, down!

Laurens:
We won!

Mulligan:
We won!

Lafayette:
We won!

Hamilton:
We won!

Choirs:
The world turned upside...

Down!

What Comes Next?       
            [KING GEORGE]
They say
The price of my warâs not a price that theyâre willing to pay
Insane
You cheat with the French, now Iâm fighting with France and with Spain
Iâm so blue
I thought that weâd made an arrangement
When you went away
You were mine to subdue
Well, even despite our estrangement, Iâve got
A small query for you:

What comes next?
Youâve been freed
Do you know how hard it is to lead?

Youâre on your own
Awesome. Wow
Do you have a clue what happens now?

Oceans rise
Empires fall
Itâs much harder when itâs all your call

All alone, across the sea
When your people say they hate you, donât
Come crawling back to me

Da da da dat da dat da da da
Da ya da
Da da dat
Da da ya da...

Youâre on your ownâ¦

Dear Theodosia what to say to you
You have my eyes
You have your mother's name
When you came into the world you cried and it broke my heart

I'm dedicating everyday to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile, you knock me out I fall apart and I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you
We'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you
We'll give the world to you and you'll blow us all away
Someday x2

Someday x2

Oh, Phillip when you smile I am undone, my son
Look at my son
Pride is not the word I'm looking for
There is so much more inside me now

Oh, Phillip you outshine the morning sun, my son
When you smile, I fall apart and I thought I was so smart

Seems to be calling me.

I practiced the law, I practicâly perfected it
Iâve seen injustice in the world and Iâve corrected it
Now for a strong central democracy

There as a New York junior delegate:

[HAMILTON]
Now what Iâm going to say may sound indelicateâ¦

[BURR]
Goes and proposes his own form of government!

His own plan for a new form of government!

Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!

Is this a legal matter?

HAMILTON
Yes, and itâs important to me

[BURR]
What do you need?

[HAMILTON]
Burr, youâre a better lawyer than me

[BURR]
Okay

[HAMILTON]
I know I talk too much, Iâm abrasive
Youâre incredible in court. Youâre succinct, persuasive
My client needs a strong defense. Youâre the solution

[BURR]
Whoâs your client?

[HAMILTON]
The new U.S. Constitution?

[BURR]
No

Burr, thatâs why we need it

The constitutionâs a mess

So it needs amendments

[BURR]
Itâs full of contradictions

[HAMILTON]
So is independence
We have to start somewhere

[BURR]
No. No way

Youâre making a mistake

Good night

Hey
What are you waiting for?

We won the war
What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?

Of course

Then defend it

And what if youâre backing the wrong horse?

Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
For the notion of a nation we now get to build
For once in your life, take a stand with pride
I donât understand how you stand to the side

[BURR]
Iâll keep all my plans
Close to my chest


Iâll wait here and see

Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!

How does the bastard orphan
Immigrant decorated war vet
Unite the colonies through more debt?
Fight the other founding fathers til he has to forfeit?
Have it all, lose it all
You ready for more yet?
Treasury Secretary. Washingtonâs the President
Evâry American experiment sets a precedent
Not so fast. Someone came along to resist him
Pissed him off until we had a two-party system
You havenât met him yet, you havenât had the chance
âcause heâs been kickinâ ass as the ambassador to France
But someoneâs gotta keep the American promise
You simply must meet Thomas. Thomas!

[JEFFERSON]
France is following us to revolution
There is no more status quo
But the sun comes up and the world still spins

[ENSEMBLE]
Aaa-ooo!

[JEFFERSON]
I helped Lafayette draft a declaration
Then I said, âI gotta go
I gotta be in Monticello.â Now the work at
Home beginsâ¦

[ENSEMBLE]
Aaa-ooo!

[JEFFERSON]
So whatâd I miss?
Whatâd I miss?
Virginia, my home sweet home, I wanna give you a kiss
Iâve been in Paris meeting lots of different ladies...
I guess I basicâlly missed the late eighties...
I traveled the wide, wide world and came back to thisâ¦

[ENSEMBLE]
Aaa-ooo!

[JEFFERSON]
Thereâs a letter on my desk from the President
Havenât even put my bags down yet
Sally be a lamb, darlinâ, wonâtcha open it?
It says the Presidentâs assembling a cabinet
And that I am to be the Secretary of State, great!
And that Iâm already Senate-approved...
I just got home and now Iâm headed up to New York

[ENSEMBLE]
Headinâ to New York!
Headinâ to New York!

Ready to face
Whateverâs awaiting
Me in N.Y.C.	 
[ENSEMBLE]
Believe that we are free



Me in N.Y.C.

[JEFFERSON]
But whoâs waitinâ for me when I step in the place?
My friend James Madison, red in the face

He grabs my arm and
I respond
âWhatâs goinâ on?â

Can you get us out of the mess weâre in?

Iâve been fighting for the South alone
Where have you been?

Aaa-ooo!	[JEFFERSON]
Uh...France.

We have to win

Whatâd I miss?

Headfirst into a political abyss!

I have my first cabinet meeting today

I guess I better think of something to say
Iâm already on my way
Letâs get to the bottom of thisâ¦

Wha? Wha? Whatâd I miss?

Iâve come home to this?

Cabinet Battle #1       
            [WASHINGTON]
Ladies and gentlemen, you coulda been anywhere in the world tonight, but youâre here with us in New York City. Are you ready for a cabinet meeting???

The issue on the table: Secretary Hamiltonâs plan to assume state debt and establish a national bank. Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir

[JEFFERSON]
âLife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.â
We fought for these ideals; we shouldnât settle for less
These are wise words, enterprising men quote âem
Donât act surprised, you guys, cuz I wrote âem

[JEFFERSON/MADISON]
Oww

[JEFFERSON]
But Hamilton forgets
His plan would have the government assume stateâs debts
Now, place your bets as to who that benefits:
The very seat of government where Hamilton sits

[HAMILTON]
Not true!

[JEFFERSON]
Ooh, if the shoe fits, wear it
If New Yorkâs in debtâ
Why should Virginia bear it? Uh! Our debts are paid, Iâm afraid
Donât tax the South cuz we got it made in the shade
In Virginia, we plant seeds in the ground
We create. You just wanna move our money around
This financial plan is an outrageous demand
And itâs too many damn pages for any man to understand
Stand with me in the land of the free
And pray to God we never see Hamiltonâs candidacy
Look, when Britain taxed our tea, we got frisky
Imagine what gonâ happen when you try to tax our whisky

[WASHINGTON]
Thank you, Secretary Jefferson. Secretary Hamilton, your response

[HAMILTON]
Thomas. That was a real nice declaration
Welcome to the present, weâre running a real nation
Would you like to join us, or stay mellow
Doinâ whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello?
If we assume the debts, the union gets
A new line of credit, a financial diuretic
How do you not get it? If weâre aggressive and competitive
The union gets a boost. Youâd rather give it a sedative?
A civics lesson from a slaver. Hey neighbor
Your debts are paid cuz you donât pay for labor
âWe plant seeds in the South. We create.â
Yeah, keep ranting
We know whoâs really doing the planting
And another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment
Donât lecture me about the war, you didnât fight in it
You think Iâm frightened of you, man?
We almost died in a trench
While you were off getting high with the French
Thomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the President
Reticentâthere isnât a plan he doesnât jettison
Madison, youâre mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine
Damn, youâre in worse shape than the national debt is in
Sittinâ there useless as two shits
Hey, turn around, bend over, Iâll show you
Where my shoe fits

[WASHINGTON]
Excuse me? Jefferson, Madison, take a walk! Hamilton, take a walk! Weâll reconvene after a brief recess. Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Sir!

[WASHINGTON]
A word

[MADISON]
You donât have the votes

[JEFFERSON/MADISON]
You donât have the votes

[JEFFERSON]
Aha-ha-ha ha!

[JEFFERSON/MADISON]
Youâre gonna need congressional approval and you donât have the votes

[JEFFERSON]
Such a blunder sometimes it makes me wonder why I even bring the thunder

[MADISON]
Why he even brings the thunderâ¦

[WASHINGTON]
You wanna pull yourself together?

[HAMILTON]
Iâm sorry, these Virginians are birds of a feather

[WASHINGTON]
Young man, Iâm from Virginia, so watch your mouth

[HAMILTON]
So we let Congress get held hostage by the South?

[WASHINGTON]
You need the votes

[HAMILTON]
No, we need bold strokes. We need this plan

[WASHINGTON]
No, you need to convince more folks

[HAMILTON]
James Madison wonât talk to me, thatâs a nonstarter

[WASHINGTON]
Winning was easy, young man. Governingâs harder

[HAMILTON]
Theyâre being intransigent

[WASHINGTON]
You have to find a compromise

[HAMILTON]
But they donât have a plan, they just hate mine!

[WASHINGTON]
Convince them otherwise

[HAMILTON]
What happens if I donât get congressional approval?

[WASHINGTON]
I imagine theyâll call for your removal

[HAMILTON]
Sirâ

[WASHINGTON]
Figure it out, Alexander. Thatâs an order from your commander

It changed the meaning. Did you intend this?
One stroke and youâve consumed my waking days
It says:

âMy dearest Angelicaâ

Thereâs nothing like summer in the city
Someone under stress meets someone looking pretty
Thereâs trouble in the air, you can smell it
And Alexanderâs by himself. Iâll let him tell it

[HAMILTON]
I hadnât slept in a week
I was weak, I was awake
You never seen a bastard orphan
More in need of a break
Longing for Angelica
Missing my wife
Thatâs when Miss Maria Reynolds walked into my life, she said:

[MARIA]
I know you are a man of honor
Iâm so sorry to bother you at home
But I donât know where to go, and I came here all aloneâ¦

[HAMILTON]
She said:

[MARIA]
My husbandâs doinâ me wrong
Beatinâ me, cheatinâ me, mistreatinâ me...
Suddenly heâs up and gone
I donât have the means to go on

[HAMILTON]
So I offered her a loan, I offered to walk her home, she said

[MARIA]
Youâre too kind, sir

[HAMILTON]
I gave her thirty bucks that I had socked away
She lived a block away, she said:

[MARIA]
This oneâs mine, sir

[HAMILTON]
Then I said, âwell, I should head back home,â
She turned red, she led me to her bed
Let her legs spread and said:

[MARIA]
Stay?

[HAMILTON]
Heyâ¦

[MARIA]
Heyâ¦

[HAMILTON]
Thatâs when I began to pray:
Lord, show me how to
Say no to this
I donât know how to
Say no to this

But my God, she looks so helpless
And her bodyâs saying, âhell, yesâ

Then her mouth is on mine, and I donât sayâ¦

[ENSEMBLE]
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!

[HAMILTON]
I wish I could say that was the last time
I said that last time. It became a pastime
A month into this endeavor I received a letter
From a Mr. James Reynolds, even better, it said:

[JAMES]
Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me: down on their luck
You see, that was my wife who you decided to

[HAMILTON]
Fuuuuâ

[JAMES]
Uh-oh! You made the wrong sucker a cuckold
So time to pay the piper for the pants you unbuckled
And hey, you can keep seeinâ my whore wife
If the price is right: if not Iâm telling your wife

[HAMILTON]
I hid the letter and I raced to her place
Screamed âHow could you?!â in her face
She said:

[MARIA]
No, sir!

[HAMILTON]
Half dressed, apologetic. A mess, she looked
Pathetic, she cried:

[MARIA]
Please donât go, sir!

[HAMILTON]
So was your whole story a setup?

[MARIA]
I donât know about any letter!

[HAMILTON]
Stop crying Goddamnit, get up!

[MARIA]
I didnât know any better

[HAMILTON]
I am ruined...

[MARIA]
Please donât leave me with him helpless
Just give him what he wants and you can have me

Whatever you want,	 
[HAMILTON]
I am helplessâhow could I do this?

I donât want you
I donât want you


[MARIA]
If you pay
You can stay



Tonight



Helpless



Whoa!


How can you
Say no to this?





[HAMILTON]
Yes



Yes


Yes


Yes.	[HAMILTON]
I donâtâ¦

Lord, show me how to
Say no to this
I donât know how to
Say no to this
Cuz the situationâs helpless

And her bodyâs screaming, âHell, yesâ

No, show me how to
Say no to this
How can I
Say no to this?
There is nowhere I can go

When her bodyâs on mine I do not sayâ¦


[MARIA]
Yes!


Yes!


Yes!


Yes!

The Room Where It Happens       
            [BURR]
Ah, Mister Secretary

[HAMILTON]
Mister Burr, sir

[BURR]
Didja hear the news about good old General Mercer?

[HAMILTON]
No

[BURR]
You know Clermont Street?

[HAMILTON]
Yeah

[BURR]
They renamed it after him. The Mercer legacy is secure

[HAMILTON]
Sure

[BURR]
And all he had to do was die

[HAMILTON]
Thatâs a lot less work

[BURR]
We oughta give it a try

[HAMILTON]
Ha

[BURR]
Now howâre you gonna get your debt plan through?

[HAMILTON]
I guess Iâm gonna finâly have to listen to you

[BURR]
Really?

[HAMILTON]
âTalk less. Smile more.â

[BURR]
Ha

Do whatever it takes to get my plan on the Congress floor

[BURR]
Now, Madison and Jefferson are merciless.

[HAMILTON]
Well, hate the sin, love the sinner

[MADISON]
Hamilton!

[HAMILTON]
Iâm sorry Burr, Iâve gotta go

[BURR]
Butâ

[HAMILTON]
Decisions are happening over dinner

[BURR]
Two Virginians and an immigrant walk into a room

[BURR AND ENSEMBLE]
Diametricâly opposed, foes

[BURR]
They emerge with a compromise, having opened doors that were

[BURR AND ENSEMBLE]
Previously closed

[ENSEMBLE]
Bros

BURR
The immigrant emerges with unprecedented financial power
A system he can shape however he wants
The Virginians emerge with the nationâs capital
And hereâs the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance:

No one else was in

No one really knows how the game is played

How the sausage gets made
We just assume that it happens
But no one else is in
The room where it happens.	 




[ENSEMBLE]
The room where it happened

The room where it happened



How the sausage gets made

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Thomas claimsâ

[JEFFERSON]
Alexander was on Washingtonâs doorstep one day
In distress ân disarray

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Thomas claimsâ

[JEFFERSON]
Alexander saidâ

[HAMILTON]
Iâve nowhere else to turn!

[JEFFERSON]
And basicâly begged me to join the fray

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Thomas claimsâ

[JEFFERSON]
I approached Madison and saidâ
âI know you hate âim, but letâs hear what he has to say.â

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Thomas claimsâ

[JEFFERSON]
Well, I arranged the meeting
I arranged the menu, the venue, the seating

[BURR]

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Meanwhileâ

[BURR]
Madison is grappling with the fact that not evâry issue can be settled by committee

[COMPANY]
Meanwhileâ

[BURR]
Congress is fighting over where to put the capitalâ

Company screams in chaos

[BURR]
It isnât pretty
Then Jefferson approaches with a dinner and invite
And Madison responds with Virginian insight:

[MADISON]
Maybe we can solve one problem with another and win a victory for the Southerners, in other wordsâ

[JEFFERSON]
Oh-ho!

[MADISON]
A quid pro quo

[JEFFERSON]
I suppose

[MADISON]
Wouldnât you like to work a little closer to home?

[JEFFERSON]
Actually, I would

[MADISON]
Well, I propose the Potomac

[JEFFERSON]
And youâll provide him his votes?

[MADISON]
Well, weâll see how it goes

[JEFFERSON]
Letâs go

[BURR]
No!

No one else was in

[BURR]
My God!

[BURR AND COMPANY]
In God we trust
But weâll never really know what got discussed
Click-boom then it happened

[BURR]
And no one else was in the room where it happened

[COMPANY]
Alexander Hamilton!

[BURR]
What did they say to you to get you to sell New York City down the river?

[COMPANY]
Alexander Hamilton!

[BURR]
Did Washington know about the dinner?
Was there Presidential pressure to deliver?

[COMPANY]
Alexander Hamilton!

[BURR]
Or did you know, even then, it doesnât matter
Where you put the U.S. Capital?

[HAMILTON]
Cuz weâll have the banks
Weâre in the same spot

[BURR]
You got more than you gave

[HAMILTON]
And I wanted what I got
When you got skin in the game, you stay in the game
But you donât get a win unless you play in the game
Oh, you get love for it. You get hate for it
You get nothing if youâ¦

[HAMILTON AND COMPANY]
Wait for it, wait for it, wait!

[HAMILTON]
God help and forgive me
I wanna build
Something thatâs gonna
Outlive me

They donât like you

Excuse me?

Oh, Wall Street thinks youâre great
Youâll always be adored by the things you create
But upstateâ

[HAMILTON]
Wait

[BURR]

Schuylerâs seat was up for grabs so I took it

[HAMILTON]
Iâve always considered you a friend

[BURR]
I donât see why that has to end

I swear your pride will be the death of us all

Cabinet Battle #2       
            [WASHINGTON]
The issue on the table: France is on the verge of war with England, and do we provide aid and our troops to our French allies or do we stay out of it? Remember, my decision on this matter is not subject to congressional approval. The only person you have to convince is me. Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir

[JEFFERSON]
When we were on deathâs door, when we were needy
We made a promise, we signed a treaty
We needed money and guns and half a chance
Who provided those funds?

[MADISON]
France

[JEFFERSON]
In return, they didnât ask for land
Only a promise that weâd lend a hand
And stand with them if they fought against oppressors
And revolution is messy but now is the time to stand
Stand with our brothers as they fight against tyranny
I know that Alexander Hamilton is here and he
Would rather not have this debate
Iâll remind you that he is not Secretary of State
He knows nothing of loyalty
Smells like new money, dresses like fake royalty
Desperate to rise above his station
Everything he does betrays the ideals of our nation

[ENSEMBLE]
Ooh!!

[JEFFERSON]
Hey, and if ya donât know, now ya know, Mr. President

[WASHINGTON]
Thank you, Secretary Jefferson. Secretary Hamilton, your response

[HAMILTON]
You must be out of your Goddamn mind if you think
The President is gonna bring the nation to the brink
Of meddling in the middle of a military mess
A game of chess, where France is Queen and Kingless
We signed a treaty with a King whose head is now in a basket
Would you like to take it out and ask it?
âShould we honor our treaty, King Louisâ head?â
âUhâ¦ do whatever you want, Iâm super dead.â

[WASHINGTON]
Enough. Hamilton is right

[JEFFERSON]
Mr. Presidentâ

[WASHINGTON]
Weâre too fragile to start another fight

[JEFFERSON]
But sir, do we not fight for freedom?

[WASHINGTON]
Sure, when the French figure out whoâs gonna lead âem

[JEFFERSON]
The people are leadingâ

[WASHINGTON]
The people are rioting
Thereâs a difference. Frankly, itâs a little disquieting you would let your ideals blind you to reality
Hamilton

[HAMILTON]
Sir

[WASHINGTON]
Draft a statement of neutrality

[JEFFERSON]
Did you forget Lafayette?

[HAMILTON]
What?

[JEFFERSON]
Have you an ounce of regret?
You accumulate debt, you accumulate power
Yet in their hour of need, you forget

[HAMILTON]
Lafayetteâs a smart man, heâll be fine
And before he was your friend, he was mine
If we try to fight in every revolution in the world, we never stop
Where do we draw the line?

[JEFFERSON]
So quick-witted

[HAMILTON]
Alas, I admit it

[JEFFERSON]
I bet you were quite a lawyer

[HAMILTON]
My defendants got acquitted

[JEFFERSON]
Yeah. Well, someone oughta remind you

[HAMILTON]
What?

[JEFFERSON]
Youâre nothing without Washington behind you

[WASHINGTON]
Hamilton!

[JEFFERSON]
Daddyâs calling!

Washington on Your Side       
            [BURR]
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side

[JEFFERSON]
Evâry action has its equal, opposite reactions
Thanks to Hamilton, our cabânetâs fractured into factions
Try not to crack under the stress, weâre breaking down like fractions
We smack each other in the press, and we donât print retractions
I get no satisfaction witnessing his fits of passion
The way he primps and preens and dresses like the pits of fashion
Our poorest citizens, our farmers, live ration to ration
As Wall Street robs âem blind in search of chips to cash in
This prick is askinâ for someone to bring him to task
Somebody gimme some dirt on this vacuous mass so we can at last unmask him
Iâll pull the trigger on him, someone load the gun and cock it
While we were all watching, he got Washington in his pocket

[JEFFERSON AND BURR]
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side

Look back at the Bill of Rights

[MADISON]
Which I wrote

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
The ink hasnât dried
It must be nice, it must be nice to have
Washington on your side

[MADISON]
So heâs doubled the size of the government
Wasnât the trouble with much our previous government size?

[BURR]
Look in his eyes!

[JEFFERSON]
See how he lies

[MADISON]
Follow the scent of his enterprise

[JEFFERSON]
Centralizing national credit
And making American credit competitive

[MADISON]
If we donât stop it we aid and abet it

[JEFFERSON]
I have to resign

[MADISON]
Somebody has to stand up for the South!

[BURR]
Somebody has to stand up to his mouth!

[JEFFERSON]
If thereâs a fire youâre trying to douse

[MADISON AND JEFFERSON]
You canât put it out from inside the house

[JEFFERSON]
Iâm in the cabinet. I am complicit in
Watching him grabbinâ at power and kissin' it
If Washington isnât gonâ listen
To disciplined dissidents, this is the difference:
This kid is out!

[MADISON/BURR/JEFFERSON]
Oh!
This immigrant isnât somebody we chose
Oh!
This immigrantâs keeping us all on our toes
Oh!
Letâs show these Federalists who theyâre up against!
Oh!

Get in the weeds, look for the seeds of
Hamiltonâs misdeeds

It must be nice. It must be nice

[MADISON]
Follow the money and see where it goes

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
It must be nice. It must be nice

[JEFFERSON]
The emperor has no clothes

It must be nice, it must be nice to have

One Last Time       
            [HAMILTON]
Mr. President, you asked to see me?

[WASHINGTON]
I know youâre busy

[HAMILTON]
What do you need, sir? Sir?

[WASHINGTON]
I wanna give you a word of warning

[HAMILTON]
Sir, I donât know what you heard
But whatever it is, Jefferson started it

[WASHINGTON]
Thomas Jefferson resigned this morning

[HAMILTON]
Youâre kidding

[WASHINGTON]
I need a favor

[HAMILTON]
Whatever you say, sir, Jefferson will pay for his behavior

[WASHINGTON]
Shh. Talk less

[HAMILTON]
Iâll use the press
Iâll write under a pseudonym, youâll see what I can do to himâ

[WASHINGTON]
I need you to draft an address

[HAMILTON]
Yes! He resigned. You can finally speak your mindâ

[WASHINGTON]
No, heâs stepping down so he can run for President

[HAMILTON]
Ha. Good luck defeating you, sir

[WASHINGTON]
Iâm stepping down. Iâm not running for President

[HAMILTON]
Iâm sorry, what?

[WASHINGTON]
One last time
Relax, have a drink with me
One last time
Letâs take a break tonight
And then weâll teach them how to say goodbye
To say goodbye
You and I

[HAMILTON]
No, sir, why?

[WASHINGTON]
I wanna talk about neutrality

[HAMILTON]
Sir, with Britain and France on the verge of war, is this the best timeâ

[WASHINGTON]
I want to warn against partisan fighting

[HAMILTON]
Butâ

[WASHINGTON]
Pick up a pen, start writing
I wanna talk about what I have learned
The hard-won wisdom I have earned

[HAMILTON]
As far as the people are concerned
You have to serve, you could continue to serveâ

[WASHINGTON]
No! One last time
The people will hear from me
One last time
And if we get this right
Weâre gonna teach âem how to say
Goodbye
You and Iâ

[HAMILTON]
Mr. President, they will say youâre weak

[WASHINGTON]
No, they will see weâre strong

[HAMILTON]
Your position is so unique

[WASHINGTON]
So Iâll use it to move them along

[HAMILTON]
Why do you have to say goodbye?

[WASHINGTON]
If I say goodbye, the nation learns to move on
It outlives me when Iâm gone
Like the scripture says:
âEveryone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree
And no one shall make them afraid.â
Theyâll be safe in the nation weâve made
I wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree
A moment alone in the shade
At home in this nation weâve made
One last time

[HAMILTON]
One last time

[HAMILTON]
Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration, I am unconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. I shall also carry with me

[HAMILTON]
The hope
That my country will
View them with indulgence;
And that
After forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal
The faults of incompetent abilities will be
Consigned to oblivion, as I myself must soon be to the mansions of rest
I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which I promise myself to realize the sweet enjoyment of partaking, in the midst of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence of good laws
Under a free government, the ever-favorite object of my heart, and the happy reward, as I trust
Of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers.	[WASHINGTON]

That canât be
Thatâs that little guy who spoke to me
All those years ago
What was it, eighty-five?
That poor man, theyâre gonna eat him alive!
Oceans rise
Empires fall
Next to Washington, they all look small
All alone
Watch them run
They will tear each other into pieces
Jesus Christ, this will be fun!

Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da da dat dat da ya daaaaa!

âPresident John Adamsâ
Good Luck

The Adams Administration       
            [BURR]
How does Hamilton the short-tempered
Protean creator of the Coast Guard
Founder of the New York Post
Ardently abuse his cabânet post
Destroy his reputation?
Welcome, folks, to

[BURR/COMPANY]
The Adams administration!

[BURR]
Jeffersonâs the runner-up, which makes him the Vice President

[JEFFERSON]
Washington canât help you now, no more mister nice President

[BURR]
Adams fires Hamilton
Privately calls him âcreole bastardâ in his taunts

[JEFFERSON]
Say what?!

[BURR]
Hamilton publishes his response

[HAMILTON]
Sit down, John, you fat motherâ[BLEEP]

[BURR]
Hamilton is out of control

[MADISON]
This is great! Heâs out of power. He holds no office. And he just destroyed President John Adams, the only other significant member of his party

[JEFFERSON]
Hamiltonâs a host unto himself. As long as he can hold a pen, heâs a threat. Letâs let him know what we know

We Know       
            [HAMILTON]
Mr. Vice President
Mr. Madison
Senator Burr
What is this?

[JEFFERSON]
We have the check stubs. From separate accountsâ¦

[MADISON]
Almost a thousand dollars, paid in different amountsâ¦

[BURR]
To a Mr. James Reynolds way back in
Seventeen ninety-one

[HAMILTON]
Is that what you have? Are you done?

[MADISON]
You are uniquely situated by virtue of your positionâ

[JEFFERSON]
Though âvirtueâ is not a word Iâd apply to this situationâ

[MADISON]
To seek financial gain, to stray from your sacred missionâ

[JEFFERSON]
And the evidence suggests youâve engaged in speculationâ

[BURR]
An immigrant embezzling our government fundsâ

[JEFFERSON/MADISON]
I can almost see the headline, your career is done

[BURR]
I hope you saved some money for your daughter and sons

[BURR/JEFFERSON/MADISON]
Ya best g'wan run back where ya come from!

[HAMILTON]
Ha! You donât even know what youâre asking me to confess

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
Confess

[HAMILTON]
You have nothing. I donât have to tell you anything at all
Unless

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
Unless

[HAMILTON]
If I can prove that I never broke the law
Do you promise not to tell another soul what you saw?

[BURR]
No one else was in the room where it happened

[HAMILTON]
Is that a yes?

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/BURR]
Um, yes

[BURR]
âDear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me: down on their luck
You see, it was my wife who you decided toââ

[JEFFERSON]
Whaaaatâ

[HAMILTON]
She courted me
Escorted me to bed and when she had me in a corner
Thatâs when Reynolds extorted me
For a sordid fee
I paid him quarterly
I may have mortally wounded my prospects
But my papers are orderly!
As you can see I kept a record of every check in my checkered
History. Check it again against your list nâ see consistency
I never spent a cent that wasnât mine
You sent the dogs after my scent, thatâs fine
Yes, I have reasons for shame
But I have not committed treason and sullied my good name
As you can see I have done nothing to provoke legal action
Are my answers to your satisfaction?

[JEFFERSON]
My God

[MADISON]
Gentlemen, letâs go

[HAMILTON]
So?

[JEFFERSON AND MADISON]
The people won't know what we know

[HAMILTON]
Burr!
How do I know you wonât use this against me
The next time we go toe to toe?

[BURR]
Alexander, rumors only grow. And we both
Know what we know

Hurricane       
            [HAMILTON]
In the eye of a hurricane
There is quiet
For just a moment
A yellow sky

When I was seventeen a hurricane
Destroyed my town
I didnât drown
I couldnât seem to die

I wrote my way out
Wrote everything down far as I could see
I wrote my way out
I looked up and the town had its eyes on me

They passed a plate around
Total strangers
Moved to kindness by my story
Raised enough for me to book passage on a
Ship that was New York boundâ¦

I wrote my way out of hell
I wrote my way to revolution
I was louder than the crack in the bell
I wrote Eliza love letters until she fell
I wrote about The Constitution and defended it well
And in the face of ignorance and resistance
I wrote financial systems into existence
And when my prayers to God were met with indifference
I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance

In the eye of a hurricane
There is quiet
For just a moment
A yellow sky

I was twelve when my mother died
She was holding me
We were sick and she was holding me
I couldnât seem to die

[BURR]
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for itâ¦


[BURR AND ENSEMBLE]
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for itâ¦



Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, waitâ¦	 

[HAMILTON]
Iâll write my way outâ¦




Write evârything down, far as I can seeâ¦



Iâll write my way outâ¦
Overwhelm them with honesty.

Burn       
            ELIZA: I saved every letter you wrote me
From the moment I read them I knew you were mine
You said you were mine
I thought you were mine
Do you know what Angelica said when we saw your first letter arrive?
She said be careful with that one love, he will do what it takes to survive
You and your words flooded my senses
Your sentences left me defenseless,
You built me palaces of paragraphs,
You built cathedrals.
I?m re reading the letters you wrote me
I?m searching and scanning for answers in every line
For some kind of sign 
And when you were mine
The world seemed to burn, burn.
You published the letters she wrote you.
You told the whole world how you brought this girl into our bed.
In clearing your name you have ruined our lives.
Do you know Angelica said when she read what you?d done?
She said you?ve married Icarus; he has flown to close to the sun.
You and your words, obsessed with your legacy,
Your sentences border on senseless,  
And you are paranoid at every paragraph how they perceive you
You, you, you.
I?m erasing myself from the narrative.
When future historians wonder how Liza reacted 
When you broke her heart.
You have torn it all apart
I?m watching it burn,
Watching it burn.
The world has no right to my heart.
The world has no place in our bed.
They don?t get to know what I said.
I?m burning the memories,
Burning the letters that might have redeemed you
You forfeit all rights to my heart.
You forfeit the place in our bed,
You?ll sleep in your office instead
With only memories of when you were mine.
I hope that you burn.

Blow Us All Away       
            [PHILIP]
Meet the latest graduate of Kingâs College!
I probâly shouldnât brag, but, dag, I amaze and astonish!
The scholars say I got the same virtuosity and brains as my pops!
The ladies say my brainâs not where the resemblance stops!
Iâm only nineteen but my mind is older
Gotta be my own man, like my father, but bolder
I shoulder his legacy with pride
I used to hear him say
That someday
I wouldâ

[ENSEMBLE]
Blow us all away

[PHILIP]
Ladies, Iâm lookin for a Mr. George Eacker
Made a speech last week, our Fourth of July speaker
He disparaged my fatherâs legacy in front of a crowd
I canât have that, Iâm making my father proud

[MARTHA]
I saw him just up Broadway a couple of blocks
He was goinâ to see a play

[PHILIP]
Well, Iâll go visit his box

[DOLLY]
God, youâre a fox

[PHILIP]
And yâall look pretty good in yaâ frocks
How âbout when I get back, we all strip down to our socks?

[BOTH]
Ok!

Blow us all away!

Shh

[PHILIP]
George!

[GEORGE]
Shh! Iâm tryinâ to watch the show!

[PHILIP]
Yaâ shoulda watched your mouth before you
Talked about my father though!

[GEORGE]
I didnât say anything that wasnât true
You fatherâs a scoundrel, and so, it seems, are you

[ENSEMBLE]
Ooooooooooh!

[PHILIP]
Itâs like that?

[GEORGE]
Yeah, I donât fool around
Iâm not your little schoolboy friends

[PHILIP]
See you on the dueling ground
That is, unless you wanna step outside and go now

[GEORGE]
I know where to find you, piss off
Iâm watchinâ this show now

[PHILIP]
Pops, if you had only heard the shit he said about you
I doubt you would have let it slide and I was not about toâ

[HAMILTON]
Slow down

[PHILIP]
I came to ask you for advice. This is my very first duel
They donât exactly cover this subject in boarding school

[HAMILTON]
Did your friends attempt to negotiate a peace?

[PHILIP]
He refused to apologize, we had to let the peace talks cease

[HAMILTON]
Where is this happening?

[PHILIP]
Across the river, in Jersey

[HAMILTON/PHILIP]
Everything is legal in New Jerseyâ¦

[HAMILTON]
Alright. So this is what youâre gonna do:
Stand there like a man until Eacker is in front of you
When the time comes, fire your weapon in the air
This will put an end to the whole affair

[PHILIP]
But what if he decides to shoot? Then Iâm a goner

[HAMILTON]
No. Heâll follow suit if heâs truly a man of honor
To take someoneâs life, that is something you canât shake
Philip, your mother canât take another heartbreak

[PHILIP]
Fatherâ

[HAMILTON]
Promise me. You donât want this
Young manâs blood on your conscience

[PHILIP]
Okay, I promise

[HAMILTON]
Come back home when youâre done
Take my guns. Be smart. Make me proud, son

[PHILIP]
My name is Philip
I am a poet
Iâm a little nervous, but I canât show it
Iâm sorry, Iâm a Hamilton with pride
You talk about my father, I cannot let it slide
Mister Eacker! How was the rest of your show?

[GEORGE]
Iâd rather skip the pleasantries
Letâs go
Grab your pistol

[PHILIP]
Confer with your men
The duel will commence after we count to ten

[ENSEMBLE]
Count to ten!

[PHILIP]
Look âem in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then slowly and clearly aim your gun towards the skyâ

It's Quiet Uptown       
            Eliza: There are moments that the words don?t reach
There is suffering too terrible to name.
You hold your child as tight as you can, and push away the unimaginable.
All the moments when you?re in so deep it feels easier to just swim down, then try to live with the unimaginable.

Chorus: The Hamilton?s move uptown, and try to live with the unimaginable.

Hamilton: When I was in the garden?I walked alone to the store. And it?s quiet uptown. I never liked the quiet before. I take the children to church on Sunday, the sign of the cross on the door. I pray, that never used to happen before.

Chorus: If you see him in the street, walking by himself, talking  to himself?have pity. 

Hamilton: Phillip you would like it uptown, it?s quiet uptown.

Chorus: He is working through the unimaginable.
Chorus (male): His hair has gone gray. He passes everyday, they say he walks the length of the city. 

Hamilton: You knock me out?I fall apart

Chorus: Can you imagine?

Hamilton: Look at where we are. Look at where we started. I know I don?t deserve you Eliza, but hear me out. That would be enough. If I could spare his life. If I could trade his life for mine?he?d be standing here right now, and you would smile, and that would be enough. I don?t pretend to know, the challenges we?re facing. I know there?s no replacing what we?ve lost, and you need time. But I?m not afraid, I know who I married. Just let me stay here by your side. That would be enough.

Chorus: If you see him in the street, walking by her side, talking by her side? have pity. 

Hamilton: Eliza do you like it uptown? It?s quiet uptown.

Chorus: He is trying to do the unimaginable. See them walking through the park, long after dark. Taking in the sights of the city.

Hamilton: Look around, look around Eliza.

Chorus: They are trying to do the unimaginable.

Angelica: There are moments that the words don?t reach. There?s a grace too powerful to name. We push away what we can never understand. We push away the unimaginable. They are standing in the garden, Alexander by Eliza?s side. She takes his hand? It?s quiet uptown.
Chorus: Forgiveness
Can you imagine?
Forgiveness.
Can you imagine?
If you see him in the street, walking by her side, talking  by her side?have pity. They are going through the unimaginable.

Can we get back to politics?

[MADISON]
Please?

[JEFFERSON]
Yo. Evâry action has an equal, opposite reaction
John Adams shat the bed. I love the guy, but heâs in traction
Poor Alexander Hamilton? He is missing in action
So now Iâm facingâ

[JEFFERSON AND MADISON]
Aaron Burr!

[JEFFERSON]
With his own faction

[MADISON]
Heâs very attractive in the North. New Yorkers like his chances

[JEFFERSON]
Heâs not very forthcoming on any particular stances

[MADISON]
Ask him a question: it glances off, he obfuscates, he dances

[JEFFERSON]
And they say Iâm a Francophile: at least they know I know where France is!

Oh!

[HAMILTON]
The people are asking to hear my voice

[ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[HAMILTON]
For the country is facing a difficult choice

[ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[HAMILTON]
And if you were to ask me who Iâd promoteâ

[ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[HAMILTON]
âJefferson has my vote

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[HAMILTON]
I have never agreed with Jefferson once

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[HAMILTON]
We have fought on like seventy-five diffârent fronts

[JEFFERSON/MADISON/ENSEMBLE]
Oh!

[HAMILTON]
But when all is said and all is done
Jefferson has beliefs. Burr has none

[ENSEMBLE]
Oooooooooooooh

[MADISON AND JEFFERSON]
Well, Iâll be damned

You won in a landslide

[BURR]
Congrats on a race well-run
I did give you a fight

[JEFFERSON]
Uh-huh

[BURR]
I look forward to our partnership

[JEFFERSON]
Our partnership?

[BURR]
As your vice-President

[JEFFERSON]
Ha. Yeah, right
You hear this guy? Man openly campaigns against me, talkinâ bout, âI look forward to our partnership.â

[MADISON]
Itâs crazy that the guy who comes in second becomes vice President

[JEFFERSON]
Yeah, you know what? We can change that. You know why?

[MADISON]
Why?

[JEFFERSON]
âcuz Iâm the President. Hey, Burr, when you see Hamilton, thank him for the endorsement

The Obedient Servant       
            [BURR]
How does Hamilton
An arrogant
Immigrant, orphan
Bastard, whoreson
Somehow endorse
Thomas Jefferson, his enemy
A man heâs despised since the beginning
Just to keep me from winning?
I wanna be in the room where it happensâ

[BURR AND COMPANY]
The room where it happens
The room where it happens

[BURR]
Youâve kept me fromâ

[BURR AND COMPANY]
The room where it happens

[BURR]
For the last time

Dear Alexander:

I am slow to anger
But I toe the line
As I reckon with the effects
Of your life on mine
I look back on where I failed
And in every place I checked
The only common thread has been your disrespect
Now you call me âamoral,â
A âdangerous disgrace,â
If youâve got something to say
Name a time and place
Face to face

I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant
A dot Burr

[HAMILTON]
Mr. Vice President:

I am not the reason no one trusts you
No one knows what you believe
I will not equivocate on my opinion
I have always worn it on my sleeve
Even if I said what you think I said
You would need to cite a more specific grievance
Hereâs an itemized list of thirty years of disagreements

[BURR]
Sweet Jesus

[HAMILTON]
Hey, I have not been shy
I am just a guy in the public eye
Tryinâ to do my best for our republic
I donât wanna fight
But I wonât apologize for doing whatâs right

I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant
A dot Ham

[BURR]
Careful how you proceed, good man
Intemperate indeed, good man
Answer for the accusations I lay at your feet or
Prepare to bleed, good man

[HAMILTON]
Burr, your grievance is legitimate
I stand by what I said, every bit of it
You stand only for yourself
Itâs what you do
I canât apologize because itâs true

[BURR]
Then stand, Alexander
Weehawken. Dawn
Guns. Drawn

[HAMILTON]
Youâre on

[BURR AND HAMILTON]
I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant

[HAMILTON]
A dot Ham

[BURR]
A dot Burr

Alexander, come back to sleep

[HAMILTON]
I have an early meeting out of town

[ELIZA]
Itâs still dark outside

[HAMILTON]
I know. I just need to write something down

[ELIZA]
Why do you write like youâre running out of time?

[HAMILTON]
Shhh

[ELIZA]
Come back to bed. That would be enough

[HAMILTON]
Iâll be back before you know Iâm gone

[ELIZA]
Come back to sleep

This meetingâs at dawn

The World Was Wide Enough       
            [MALE COMPANY]
One two three four

[FULL COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON AND BURR)]
Five six seven eight nineâ

[BURR]
There are ten things you need to know

[COMPANY]
Number one!

[BURR]
We rowed across the Hudson at dawn
My friend, William P. Van Ness signed on as myâ

[BURR AND COMPANY]
Number two!

[BURR]
Hamilton arrived with his crew:
Nathaniel Pendleton and a doctor that he knew

[COMPANY]
Number three!

[BURR]
I watched Hamilton examine the terrain
I wish I could tell you what was happâning in his brain
This man has poisoned my political pursuits!

[COMPANY]
Most disputes die and no one shoots!
Number four!

[BURR]
Hamilton drew first position
Looking, to the world, like a man on a mission
This is a soldier with a marksmanâs ability
The doctor turned around so he could have deniability

COMPANY
Five!

BURR
Now I didnât know this at the time
But we wereâ

[BURR AND PHILIP]
Near the same spot
Your son died, is that
Whyâ	[HAMILTON]
Near the same spot
My son died, is that
Whyâ

[COMPANY]
Six!

[BURR]
He examined his gun with such rigor?
I watched as he methodically fiddled with the trigger

[COMPANY]
Seven!

[BURR]
Confession time? Hereâs what I got:
My fellow soldiersâll tell you Iâm a terrible shot

[COMPANY]
Number eight!

[BURR/HAMILTON/ENSEMBLE MEN]
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight

[BURR]
They wonât teach you this in your classes
But look it up, Hamilton was wearing his glasses
Why? If not to take deadly aim?
Itâs him or me, the world will never be the same
I had only one thought before the slaughter:
This man will not make an orphan of my daughter

[COMPANY]
Number nine!

[BURR]
Look him in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count:

[COMPANY]
One two three four five six seven eight nine
Number ten paces! Fire!â

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
Is this where it gets me, on my feet, sevâral feet ahead of me?
I see it coming, do I run or fire my gun or let it be?
There is no beat, no melody
Burr, my first friend, my enemy
Maybe the last face I ever see
If I throw away my shot, is this how youâll remember me?
What if this bullet is my legacy?

Legacy. What is a legacy?
Itâs planting seeds in a garden you never get to see
I wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me
America, you great unfinished symphony, you sent for me
You let me make a difference
A place where even orphan immigrants
Can leave their fingerprints and rise up
Iâm running out of time. Iâm running, and my timeâs up
Wise up. Eyes up
I catch a glimpse of the other side
Laurens leads a soldiersâ chorus on the other side
My son is on the other side
Heâs with my mother on the other side
Washington is watching from the other side

Teach me how to say goodbye

Rise up, rise up, rise up
Eliza

My love, take your time
Iâll see you on the other side
Raise a glass to freedom...

[BURR AND COMPANY]
He aims his pistol at the skyâ

[BURR]
Wait!

[BURR]
I strike him right between his ribs
I walk towards him, but I am ushered away
They row him back across the Hudson
I get a drink

[COMPANY]
Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah

[BURR]
I hear wailing in the streets

[COMPANY]
Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah

[BURR]
Somebody tells me, âYouâd better hide.â

[COMPANY]
Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah

[BURR]
They say

[BURR AND ANGELICA]
Angelica and Elizaâ

[BURR]
Were both at his side when he died
Death doesnât discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
History obliterates
In every picture it paints
It paints me and all my mistakes
When Alexander aimed
At the sky
He may have been the first one to die
But Iâm the one who paid for it

I survived, but I paid for it

Now Iâm the villain in your history
I was too young and blind to see...
I shouldâve known
I shouldâve known
The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me
The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me

Finale (Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story)       
            [WASHINGTON]
Let me tell you what I wish Iâd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory
You have no control:

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

[BURR]
President Jefferson:

[JEFFERSON]
Iâll give him this: his financial system is a
Work of genius. I couldnât undo it if I tried
And I tried

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

President Madison:

[MADISON]
He took our country from bankruptcy to prosperity
I hate to admit it, but he doesnât get enough credit
For all the credit he gave us

[WASHINGTON AND COMPANY]
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

[ANGELICA]
Every other founding father story gets told
Every other founding father gets to grow old

[BURR]
But when youâre gone, who remembers your name?
Who keeps your flame?

Who tells your story?

[ELIZA]
And Iâm still not through
I ask myself, âWhat would you do if you had moreââ

The Lord, in his kindness
He gives me what you always wanted
He gives me moreâ
