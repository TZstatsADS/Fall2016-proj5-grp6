No One Mourns the Wicked       
            CITIZENS OF OZ: 
Good news! She's dead!
The Witch of the West is dead!
The wickedest witch there ever was
The enemy of all of us here in Oz
Is Dead!
Good news!
Good news!

SOMEONE IN THE CROWD:
(spoken) Look! It's Glinda!

GLINDA
(spoken) Fellow Ozians:
(sung) Let us be glad
Let us be grateful
Let us rejoicify that goodness could subdue
The wicked workings of you-know-who
Isn't it nice to know
That good will conquer evil?
The truth we all believe'll by and by
Outlive a lie
For you and - 

SOMEONE IN THE CROWD:
No one mourns the Wicked

ANOTHER PERSON:
No one cries "They won't return!"

ALLNo one lays a lily on their grave

MAN
The good man scorns the Wicked!

WOMEN
Through their lives, our children learn

ALL
What we miss, when we misbehave:

GLINDA
And Goodness knows
The Wicked's lives are lonely
Goodness knows
The Wicked die alone
It just shows when you're Wicked
You're left only
On your own

ALL
Yes, Goodness knows
The Wicked's lives are lonely
Goodness knows
The Wicked cry alone
Nothing grows for the Wicked
They reap only 
What they've sown

GLINDA(spoken) Are people born Wicked? Or do they have
Wickedness thrust upon them? After all, she had 
a father. She had a mother, as so many do:

FATHER
How I hate to go and leave you lonely

MOTHER
That's alright - it's only just one night

FATHERBut know that you're here in my heart
While I'm out of your sight

GLINDA
(spoken)
And like every family - they had their secrets

LOVER
Have another drink, my dark-eyed beauty
I've got one more night left, here in town
So have another drink of green elixir
And we'll have ourselves a little mixer
Have another swallow, little lady,
And follow me down:

GLINDA
(spoken) And of course, from the moment she was born,
she was - well - different

MIDWIFEIt's coming

FATHERNow?

MIDWIFE
The baby's coming

FATHER
And how!

MIDWIFE AND FATHER
I see a nose
I see a curl
It's a healthy, perfect,
Lovely, little - 

FATHER
(spoken) Sweet Oz!

MOTHER
(spoken) What is it? : what's wrong?

MIDWIFEHow can it be?

FATHER
What does it mean?

MIDWIFE
It's atrocious

FATHERIt's obscene!

MIDWIFE AND FATHER
Like a froggy, ferny cabbage
The baby is unnaturally

ALL
Green!

FATHER
(spoken) Take it away: take it away!

GLINDA
(spoken) So you see - it couldn't have been easy!
ALL
No one mourns the Wicked!
Now at last, she's dead and gone!
Now at last, there's joy throughout the land
And Goodness knows
We know what Goodness is
Goodness knows
The Wicked die alone

GLINDA
She died alone:

ALLWoe to those 
Who spurn what Goodness
They are shown
No one mourns the Wicked

GLINDA
Good news!
CROWD
No one mourns the Wicked!

ALL
No one mourns the Wicked!
Wicked!

Dear Old Shiz       
            PERSON IN CROWD
(spoken) Glinda! Is it true - were you her friend?!

GLINDA
(spoken) Well - it depends on what you mean by "friend." I did
know her. That is, our paths did cross. At school:

STUDENTS
O hallowed halls and vine-draped walls
The proudliest sight there is
When grey and sere our hair hath turned
We shall still revere the lessons learned 
In our days at dear old Shiz
Our days at dear old

The Wizard and I       
            MADAME MORRIBLE
(spoken) Oh, Miss Elphaba:
(sung) Many years I have waited
For a gift like yours to appear
Why, I predict the Wizard
Could make you his
Magic grand vizier!
My dear, my dear
I'll write at once to the Wizard
Tell him of you in advance
With a talent like yours, dear
There is a defin-ish chance
If you work as you should
You'll be making good:

ELPHABA
Did that really just happen?
Have I actually understood?
This weird quirk I've tried
To suppress or hide
Is a talent that could
Help me meet the Wizard
If I make good
So I'll make good:

When I meet the Wizard
Once I prove my worth
And then I meet the Wizard
What I've waited for since: since birth!
And with all his Wizard wisdom
By my looks, he won't be blinded
Do you think the Wizard is dumb?
Or, like Munchkins, so small-minded?
No! He'll say to me,
"I see who you truly are -
A girl on whom I can rely!"
And that's how we'll begin
The Wizard and I:

Once I'm with the Wizard
My whole life will change
'Cuz once you're with the Wizard
No one thinks you're strange!
No father is not proud of you,
No sister acts ashamed
And all of Oz has to love you
When by the Wizard you're acclaimed
And this gift - or this curse - 
I have inside
Maybe at last, I'll know why
When we are hand and hand - 
The Wizard and I!

And one day, he'll say to me, "Elphaba,
A girl who is so superior
Shouldn't a girl who's so good inside
Have a matching exterior?
And since folks here to an absurd degree
Seem fixated on your verdigris 
Would it be all right by you
If I de-greenify you?"

And though of course
That's not important to me
"All right, why not?" I'll reply
Oh, what a pair we'll be
The Wizard and I:
Yes, what a pair we'll be
The Wizard and:

Unlimited
My future is unlimited
And I've just had a vision
Almost like a prophecy
I know - it sounds truly crazy
And true, the vision's hazy
But I swear, someday there'll be
A celebration throughout Oz
That's all to do with me!

And I'll stand there with the Wizard
Feeling things I've never felt
And though I'd never show it
I'll be so happy, I could melt!
And so it will be
For the rest of my life
And I'll want nothing else
Till I die
Held in such high esteem
When people see me, they will scream
For half of Oz's fav'rite team:
The Wizard
And I!

Something Bad       
            DOCTOR DILLAMOND
(spoken) Oh, Miss Elphaba - The things one hears these 
days. Dreadful things:
(sung) I've heard of an Ox 
A professor from Quox
No longer permitted to teach
Who has lost all powers of speech
And an Owl in Munchkin Rock
A vicar with a thriving flock
Forbidden to preach
Now he can only screech!
Only rumors - but still - 
Enough to give pause
To anyone with paws
Something bad is happening in Oz:

ELPHABA
Something bad? Happening in Oz?

DILLAMOND
Under the surface
Behind the scenes
Something baaaaaaad:
(spoken) Sorry: "Bad":

ELPHABA(spoken) Doctor Dillamond - If something bad is happening
to the Animals, someone's got to tell the Wizard.
That's why we have a Wizard.
(sung) So nothing bad:.

DILLAMOND
(spoken) I hope you're right:

BOTHNothing all that bad:

DILLAMOND
Nothing truly baaaaaad:.

Dancing Through Life       
            FIYERO
The trouble with school is
They always try to teach the wrong lesson
Believe me, I've been kicked out
Of enough of them to know
They want you to become less callow
Less shallow
But I say: why invite stress in?
Stop studying strife
And learn to live "the unexamined life":

Dancing through life
Skimming the surface
Gliding where turf is smooth
Life's more painless
For the brainless
Why think too hard?
When it's so soothing
Dancing through life
No need to tough it
When you can sluff it off as I do
Nothing matters
But knowing nothing matters
It's just life
So keep dancing through

Dancing through life
Swaying and sweeping
And always keeping cool
Life is fraught-less
When you're thoughtless
Those who don't try
Never look foolish
Dancing through life
Mindless and careless
Make sure you're where less
Trouble is rife
Woes are fleeting
Blows are glancing
When you're dancing
Through life:
(spoken) So - what's the most swankified place in town?

GALINDA 
(spoken) That would be the Ozdust Ballroom.

FIYERO
(spoken) Sounds perfect.
(sung) Let's go down to the Ozdust Ballroom
We'll meet there later tonight
We can dance till it's light
Find the prettiest girl:
Give 'er a whirl:
Right on down to the Ozdust Ballroom
Come on - follow me
You'll be happy to be there:

ALL
Dancing through life
Down at the Ozdust

FIYERO
If only because dust
Is what we come to:

ALL
Nothing matters
But knowing nothing matters
It's just life

FIYERO
So keep dancing through:

BOQ
(spoken) Miss Galinda - I hope you'll save at least one
dance for me. I'll be right there. Waiting. Allnight.

GALINDA(spoken) Oh - that's so kind. But you know what would
be even kinder?
(sung) See that tragic'ly beautiful girl
The one in the chair
It seems so unfair
We should go on a spree
And not she
Gee - 
I know someone would be my hero
If that someone were to go invite her:

BOQ
(spoken) Well, maybe - I could invite her!

GALINDAOh, Bick, really?
You would do that for me?

BOQ
(spoken) I would do anything for you, Miss Galinda:

GALINDA
(spoken) So:

FIYERO
(spoken) So I'll be picking you up around eight?

GALINDA(spoken) After all -
(sung) Now that we've met one another

FIYERO AND GALINDA
It's clear - we deserve each other

GALINDAYou're perfect:

FIYERO
You're perfect:

BOTH
So we're perfect together
Born to be forever
Dancing through life:

NESSAROSE
(spoken) Oh, Elphaba - isn't it wonderful?
(sung) Fin'lly, for this one night
I'm about to have a fun night
With this Munchkin boy
Galinda found for me 
And I only wish there were 
Something I could do for her
To repay her
Elphaba, see?
We deserve each other
And Galinda helped it come true
We deserve each other,
Me and Boq:
(spoken) Elphaba, please try to understand:

ELPHABA
I do:
(spoken) Galinda - my sister and I were talking about you
just now-

GALINDA
(spoken) And I was just talking about you! I thought you
might want to wear this hat to the party tonight!
(sung) It's really, uh, sharp, don't you think?
You know - black is this year's pink
You deserve each other
This hat and you
You're both so smart
You deserve each other
So here, out of the goodness of my heart:

BOQ
(spoken) Listen: Nessa:

NESSAROSE
(spoken) Yes?

BOQ
Uh - Nessa
I've got something to confess, a
Reason why, well - 
Why I asked you here tonight
Now I know it isn't fair:

NESSAROSE
(spoken) Oh, Boq, I know why.

BOQ
(spoken) You do?

NESSAROSE
It's because I'm in this chair
And you felt sorry for me
Well - isn't that right?

BOQ
(spoken) No! No! It's because: because:
(sung) Because you are so beautiful!

NESSAROSE
Oh, Boq, I think you're wonderful!
And we deserve each other
Don't you see, this is our chance?
We deserve each other
Don't we, Boq?

BOQ
(spoken) You know what?
(sung) Let's dance:

NESSAROSE
(spoken) What?!

BOQ
Let's dance!

ALL
Dancing through life
Down at the Ozdust
If only because dust
Is what we come to!
And the strange thing:
Your life could end up changing
While you're dancing
Through!

Popular       
            GALINDA
(spoken) Elphie - now that we're friends, I've decided to
make you my new project.

ELPHABA
(spoken) You really don't have to do that

GALINDA
(spoken) I know. That's what makes me so nice!
(sung) Whenever I see someone
Less fortunate than I
(And let's face it - who isn't
Less fortunate than I?)
My tender heart
Tends to start to bleed
And when someone needs a makeover
I simply have to take over
I know I know exactly what they need
And even in your case
Tho' it's the toughest case I've yet to face
Don't worry - I'm determined to succeed
Follow my lead
And yes, indeed
You will be:

Popular!
You're gonna be popular!
I'll teach you the proper ploys
When you talk to boys
Little ways to flirt and flounce
I'll show you what shoes to wear
How to fix your hair
Everything that really counts

To be popular
I'll help you be popular!
You'll hang with the right cohorts
You'll be good at sports
Know the slang you've got to know
So let's start
'Cause you've got an awfully long way to go:

Don't be offended by my frank analysis
Think of it as personality dialysis
Now that I've chosen to be come a pal, a
Sister and adviser
There's nobody wiser
Not when it comes to popular -
I know about popular
And with an assist from me
To be who you'll bee
Instead of dreary who-you-were: are:
There's nothing that can stop you
From becoming popu-
Ler: lar:

La la la la
We're gonna make
You popular

When I see depressing creatures
With unprepossessing features
I remind them on their own behalf
To think of 
Celebrated heads of state or
Specially great communicators
Did they have brains or knowledge?
Don't make me laugh!

They were popular! Please -
It's all about popular!
It's not about aptitude
It's the way you're viewed
So it's very shrewd to be
Very very popular
Like me!

(spoken) Why, Miss Elphaba, look at you. You're beautiful.

ELPHABA(spoken) I - I have to go:

GALINDA
(spoken) You're welcome!
(sung) And though you protest
Your disinterest
I know clandestinely
You're gonna grin and bear it
Your new found popularity
La la la la
You'll be popular -
Just not as quite as popular
As me!

I'm Not That Girl       
            ELPHABA
Hands touch, eyes meet
Sudden silence, sudden heat
Hearts leap in a giddy whirl
He could be that boy
But I'm not that girl:

Don't dream too far
Don't lose sight of who you are
Don't remember that rush of joy
He could be that boy
I'm not that girl

Ev'ry so often we long to steal
To the land of what-might-have-been
But that doesn't soften the ache we feel
When reality sets back in

Blithe smile, lithe limb
She who's winsome, she wins him
Gold hair with a gentle curl
That's the girl he chose
And Heaven knows
I'm not that girl:

Don't wish, don't start
Wishing only wounds the heart
I wasn't born for the rose and the pearl
There's a girl I know
He loves her so
I'm not that girl:

And helping you with your ascent al-

Defying Gravity       
            GLINDA
(spoken) Elphaba - why couldn't you have stayed calm for
once, instead of flying off the handle!
(sung) I hope you're happy!
I hope you're happy now
I hope you're happy how you
Hurt your cause forever
I hope you think you're clever!

ELPHABA
I hope you're happy
I hope you're happy, too
I hope you're proud how you 
Would grovel in submission
To feed your own ambition

BOTH
So though I can't imagine how
I hope you're happy right now

GLINDA
(spoken) Elphie, listen to me. Just say you're sorry:
(sung) You can still be with the Wizard
What you've worked and waited for
You can have all you ever wanted:

ELPHABA
(spoken) I know:
(sung) But I don't want it - 
No - I can't want it
Anymore:

Something has changed within me 
Something is not the same
I'm through with playing by the rules
Of someone else's game
Too late for second-guessing
Too late to go back to sleep
It's time to trust my instincts
Close my eyes: and leap!

It's time to try
Defying gravity
I think I'll try
Defying gravity
And you can't pull me down!

GLINDA
Can't I make you understand?
You're having delusions of grandeur:

ELPHABA
I'm through accepting limits
'Cuz someone says they're so
Some things I cannot change
But till I try, I'll never know!
Too long I've been afraid of
Losing love I guess I've lost
Well, if that's love
It comes at much too high a cost!
I'd sooner buy
Defying gravity
Kiss me goodbye
I'm defying gravity
And you can't pull me down:
(spoken) Glinda - come with me. Think of what we could
do: together.

(sung) Unlimited
Together we're unlimited
Together we'll be the greatest team 
There's ever been
Glinda - 
Dreams, the way we planned 'em

GLINDA
If we work in tandem:

BOTH
There's no fight we cannot win
Just you and I
Defying gravity
With you and I
Defying gravity

ELPHABA
They'll never bring us down!

GLINDA
I hope you're happy
Now that you're choosing this

ELPHABA
(spoken) You too
(sung) I hope it brings you bliss

BOTH
I really hope you get it
And you don't live to regret it
I hope you're happy in the end
I hope you're happy, my friend:

ELPHABASo if you care to find me
Look to the western sky!
As someone told me lately:
"Ev'ryone deserves the chance to fly!"
And if I'm flying solo
At least I'm flying free
To those who'd ground me
Take a message back from me
Tell them how I am
Defying gravity
I'm flying high
Defying gravity
And soon I'll match them in renown
And nobody in all of Oz
No Wizard that there is or was

Thank Goodness       
            CITIZENS OF OZ
Ev'ry day, more wicked!
Ev'ry day, the terror grows!
All of Oz is ever on alert!
That's the way with Wicked - 
Spreading fear where e'er she goes
Seeking out new victims she can hurt!

A HYSTERICAL WOMAN
Like some terrible green blizzard
Throughout the land she flies:

AN OUTRAGED MAN
Defaming our poor Wizard
With her calumnies and lies!

ALLShe lies!
Save us from the Wicked!
Shield us so we won't be hexed!
Give us warning:
Where will she strike next?
Where will she strike next?
Where will she strike next!?

GLINDA
(spoken) Fellow Ozians - as terrifying as terror is, let us put 
aside our panic for this one day: and celebrate!
(sung) Oh what a celebration
We'll have today

CROWDThank Goodness!

GLINDA
Let's have a celebration
The Glinda way!

CROWDThank Goodness!

MORRIBLE
Fin'lly a day that's
Totally Wicked-Witch free!

CROWD
We couldn't be happier
Thank Goodness!

GLINDA
Yes - 
We couldn't be happier, 
Right, dear?
Couldn't be happier
Right here
Look what we've got
A fairy-tale plot
Our very own happy ending
Where we couldn't be happier - 
True, dear?
Couldn't be happier
And we're happy to share
Our ending vicariously
With all of you
He couldn't look handsomer
I couldn't feel humbler
We couldn't be happier
Because happy is what happens
When all your dreams come true!

MORRIBLE(spoken) And Glinda dear, we're happy for you! As Press
Secretary, I have striven to ensure that all of Oz
knows the story of your braverism:

(sung) The day you were first summoned
To an audience with OzAnd although he would not tell you why initially
When you bowed before his throne
He decreed you'd hence be known
As Glinda the Good - officially!

Then with a jealous squeal
The Wicked Witch burst from concealment
Where she had been lurking -surrpetitially!

PEOPLE IN CROWD
I hear she has an extra eye
That always remains awake
I hear that she can shed her skin
As easily as a snake!
I hear some rebel Animals
Are giving her food and shelter!
I hear her soul is so unclean
Pure water can melt her!

FIYERO
What!?

CROWD
Melt her!?
Please - somebody go and melt her!

FIYERO
(spoken) Do you hear that - water will melt her?! People
are so empty-headed, they'll believe anything!

GLINDA
(spoken) Fiyero! Oh - yes, thanks plenty, dearest! He's gone to
fetch me a refreshment. He's so thoughtful that way!

(sung) That's why I couldn't be happier
No, I couldn't be happier
Though it is, I admit
The tiniest bit
Unlike I anticipated
But I couldn't be happier
Simply couldn't be happier
(spoken) Well - not "simply":
(sung) 'Cause getting your dreams
It's strange, but it seems
A little - well - complicated
There's a kind of a sort of : cost
There's a couple of things get: lost
There are bridges you cross
You didn't know you crossed
Until you've crossed
And if that joy, that thrill
Doesn't thrill you like you think it will
Still - 
With this perfect finale
The cheers and ballyhoo
Who 
Wouldn't be happier?
So I couldn't be happier
Because happy is what happens
When all your dreams come true
Well, isn't it?
Happy is what happens
When your dreams come true!

CROWD
We love you, Glinda, if we may be so frank

GLINDAThank Goodness!

CROWD
For all this joy, we know who we've got to thank:
Thank Goodness!
That means the Wizard, Glinda:
GLINDA
And fiance!

CROWD
They couldn't be goodlier
She couldn't be lovelier
We couldn't be luckier

GLINDA
I couldn't be happier
CROWDThank Goodness:

GLINDA AND CROWD
Today!
Thank Goodness for today!

The Wicked Witch of the East       
            NESSAROSE (spoken)
Elphaba, shut up! First of all, I can't harbor a fugitive, I am an unelected offical. And why should I help you? You fly
around Oz trying to rescure animals you've never even met and not once have you ever thought to use your powers to rescue me!

All of my life, I've depended on you
(sung) How do you think that feels?
All of my life, I've depended on you
And this hideous chair with wheels.
Scrounging for scraps of pity to pick up
And longing to kick up my heels.

ELPHABA (spoken)
Nessa, there isn't a spell for everything. The power is mysterious, it not like cobbiling up a pair of- wait. (beings
chanting from the Grimmerie)

Oh Nessa, at last.
(sung)I've done what long ago I should
And finally from these powers something good
Finally, something good

NESSAROSE (spoken)
Boq! Boq, come quickly!

BOQ (spoken)
You did this for her?

NESSAROSE (spoken)
For both of us!

BOQ (spoken)
Oh Nessa... this changes everything.

NESSAROSE (spoken)
I know.

BOQ:
(spoken)Nessa

NESSAROSE
(spoken)Yes?

BOQ:
(sung)Oh, Nessa
Surely now I'll matter less to you
You won't mind my leaving her tonight.

NESSAROSE
(spoken)Leaving?

BOQ
(sung)Yes,
That ball thats being staged,
Announcing Glinda is engaged
To Fiyero

NESSAROSE
(spoken)Glinda?

BOQ
(sung)Yes Nessa, that's right
I've got to go appeal to her
Express the way I feel for her
(spoken) Nessa, I lost my heart to Glinda from the moment I first saw her. You know that.

NESSAROSE
(spoken)Lost your heart?
(sung)Well we'll see about that.

ELPHABA (spoken)
Nessa, let him go.

NESSAROSE
(sung)Did you think I'd let you leave me here flat?!

BOQ (spoken)
Don't come any closer!

NESSAROSE
(sung)You're going to lose your heart to me, I tell you!
If I have, I have to... magic spell you. (beings chanting from the Grimmerie)

(spoken) This is all your fault! If you had not shown me that horrenible book-

ELPHABA (spoken)
I've got to find another spell. It's the only thing that might work.

NESSAROSE:
(sung)Save him please, just save him.
My poor Boq, my sweet, my brave him.
Do not leave me till my sorry life has ceased.

ELHAPHA
(begins chanting in melody)

NESSAROSE
(sung)Alone and loveless here,
Just the girl in the mirror
Just her and me, Wicked Witch of the East!
We deserve each other.

Wonderful       
            WIZARD
I never asked for this
Or planned it in advance
I was merely blown here
By the winds of chance
I never saw myself 
As a Solomon or Socrates
I knew who I was:
One of your dime a dozen
Mediocrities

Then suddenly I'm here
Respected - worshipped, even
Just because the folks in Oz
Needed someone to believe in
Does it surprise you
I got hooked, and all too soon?
What can I say?
I got carried away
And not just by balloon:

Wonderful
They called me "Wonderful"
So I said "Wonderful" - if you insist
I will be "Wonderful"
And they said "Wonderful"
Believe me, it's hard to resist
'Cause it feels wonderful
They think I'm wonderful
Hey, look who's wonderful -
This corn-fed hick
Who said: "It might be keen
To build a town of green
And a wonderful road of yellow brick!"

(spoken) See - I never had a family of my own. So, I 
guess I just - wanted to give the citizens of Oz everything.

ELPHABA(spoken) So you lied to them.

WIZARD
(spoken) Elphaba, where I'm from, we believe all sorts of
things that aren't true. We call it - "history."

(sung) A man's called a traitor - or liberator
A rich man's a thief - or philanthropist
Is one a crusader - or ruthless invader?
It's all in which label
Is able to persist
There are precious few at ease
With moral ambiguities
So we act as though they don't exist

They call me "Wonderful"
So I am wonderful
In fact - it's so much who I am
It's part of my name
And with my help, you can be the same
At long, long last receive your due
Long overdue
Elphaba - The most celebrated
Are the rehabilitated
There'll be such a - whoop-de-doo
A celebration throughout Oz
That's all to do - with you

Wonderful
They'll call you wonderful:

ELPHABA
It does sound wonderful:

WIZARD
Trust me - it's fun

BOTH
When you are wonderful
It would be wonderful?
Wonderful, wonderful

WIZARD
One! Two! And:
(they dance)

As Long as You're Mine       
            ELPHABA
Kiss me too fiercely 
Hold me too tight
I need help believing
You're with me tonight
My wildest dreamings
Could not foresee
Lying beside you 
With you wanting me

And just for this moment
As long as you're mine
I've lost all resistance
And crossed some borderline
And if it turns out
It's over too fast 
I'll make every last moment last
As long as you're mine

FIYERO
Maybe I'm brainless
Maybe I'm wise
But you've got me seeing 
Though different eyes
Somehow I've fallen 
Under your spell
And somehow I'm feeling
It's up that I fell

BOTH
Every moment 
As long as you're mine
I'll wake up my body
And make up for lost time

FIYERO
Say there's no future
For us as a pair

BOTH
And though I may know
I don't care
Just for this moment
As long as you're mine
Come be how you want to
And see how bright we shine
Borrow the moonlight
Until it is through
And know I'll be here holding you
As long as you're mine

FIYERO
(spoken)
What is it?

ELPHABA
(spoken)
It's just for the first time,
I feel ... wicked

No Good Deed       
            ELPHABA
(spoken) Fiyero!
(sung) Eleka nahmen nahmen
Ah tum ah tum eleka nahmen
Eleka nahmen nahmen
Ah tum ah tum eleka nahmen

Let his flesh not be torn
Let his blood leave no stain
Though they beat him
Let him feel no pain
Let his bones never break
And however they try
To destroy him
Let him never die:
Let him never die:

Eleka nahmen nahmen
Ah tum ah tum eleka nahmen
Eleka nahmen nahmen
Ah tum ah tum eleka: eleka:

What good is this chanting?
I don't even know what I'm reading!
I don't even know which trick I ought to try
Fiyero, where are you?
Already dead, or bleeding?
One more disaster I can add to my
Generous supply?

Unlimited
The damage is unlimited
To everyone I've tried to help
Or tried to love
And, oh, Fiyero, you're the latest
Victim of my greatest achievement
In a long career of distress
Every time I could, I tried making good
And what I made was a mess!

No good deed goes unpunished
No act of charity goes unresented
No good deed goes unpunished
That's my new creed
My road of good intentions
Led where such roads always lead
No good deed
Goes unpunished!

Nessa: 
Doctor Dillamond:
Fiyero:
Fiyero!!

One question haunts and hurts
Too much, too much to mention:
Was I really seeking good
Or just seeking attention?
Is that all good deeds are
When looked at with an ice-cold eye?
If that's all good deeds are
Maybe that's the reason why

No good deed goes unpunished
All helpful urges should be circumvented
No good deed goes unpunished
Sure, I meant well - 
Well, look at what well-meant did:
All right, enough - so be it
So be it, then:
Let all Oz be agreed
I'm wicked through and through
Since I can not succeed
Fiyero, saving you
I promise no good deed 
Will I attempt to do again
Ever again
No good deed
Will I do again!

March of the Witch Hunters

Go and hunt her
And find her 
And kill her

VICIOUS WOMAN
(spoken) Good fortune, Witch Hunters!

OZIANS
Go and hunt her
And find her
And kill her

RABID MAN

OZIANS
Wickedness must be punished
Evil effectively eliminated
Wickedness must be punished
Kill the Witch!

TINMAN
(spoken) And this is more than just a service to the Wizard.
I have a personal score to settle with Elph-with
The Witch!

(sung) It's due to her I'm made of tin
Her spell made this occur
So for once I'm glad I'm heartless
I'll be heartless killing her!

And the lion also
Has a grievance to repay
If she'd let him fight his own battles
When he was young
He wouldn't be a coward today!

CROWD
Kill her! Kill the witch!

ALL
Wickedness must be punished
Brave Witch-Hunters, I would join you if I could
Because Wickedness must be punished
Punished
Punished
But good!

For Good       
            ELPHABA
I'm limited:
Just look at me - I'm limited
And just look at you -
You can do all I couldn't do, Glinda
So now it's up to you
(spoken) For both of us
(sung) Now it's up to you:

GLINDA
I've heard it said 
That people come into our lives for a reason
Bringing something we must learn
And we are led
To those who help us most to grow 
If we let them
And we help them in return
Well, I don't know if I believe that's true
But I know I'm who I am today
Because I knew you:

Like a comet pulled from orbit
As it passes a sun
Like a stream that meets a boulder
Halfway through the wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
But because I knew you
I have been changed for good

ELPHABA
It well may be
That we will never meet again
In this lifetime
So let me say before we part
So much of me
Is made of what I learned from you
You'll be with me
Like a handprint on my heart
And now whatever way our stories end
I know you have re-written mine
By being my friend:
Like a ship blown from its mooring
By a wind off the sea
Like a seed dropped by a skybird
In a distant wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
But because I knew you:

GLINDA
Because I knew you:

BOTHI have been changed for good

ELPHABA
And just to clear the air
I ask forgiveness
For the things I've done you blame me for

GLINDA
But then, I guess we know
There's blame to share

BOTH
And none of it seems to matter anymore

GLINDA ELPHABA
Like a comet pulled Like a ship blown
From orbit as it Off it's mooring
Passes a sun, like By a wind off the
A stream that meets Sea, like a seed
A boulder, half-way Dropped by a 
Through the wood Bird in the wood

BOTH
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
I do believe I have been changed for the better?

GLINDA
And because I knew you:
ELPHABA
Because I knew you:

BOTH
Because I knew you:
I have been changed for good.
