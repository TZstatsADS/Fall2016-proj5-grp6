Prologue       
            AUCTIONEER

(spoken) Sold. Your number, sir? Thank you.

(spoken) Lot 663, then, ladies and gentlemen: 
a poster for this house's production of "Hannibal" by Chalumeau.

PORTER

(spoken) Showing here.

AUCTIONEER

(spoken) Do I have ten francs? Five then. Five I am bid. 
Six, seven. Against you, sir, seven. Eight.
Eight once. Selling twice. Sold, to Raoul, Vicomte de Chagny.

(spoken) 
Lot 664: a wooden pistol and three human skulls 
from the 1831 production of "Robert le Diable" by Meyerbeer. 
Ten francs for this. Ten, thank you. 
Ten francs still. Fifteen, thank you, sir Fifteen I am bid. 
Going at fifteen. Your number, sir?

(spoken) 665, ladies and gentlemen: a papier-mache musical box, 
in the shape of a barrel-organ.
Attached, the figure of a monkey in Persian robes playing the cymbals. 
This item, discovered in the vaults of the theatre, still in working order.

PORTER (holding it up)

(spoken) Showing here. (He sets it in motion)

AUCTIONEER

(spoken) May I start at twenty francs? Fifteen, then? Fifteen I am bid.

(The bidding continues. RAOUL. eventually buys the box for thirty francs)

(spoken) Sold, for thirty francs to the Vicomte de Chagny. Thank you, sir.

(The box is handed across to RAOUL. 
He studies it, as attention focuses on him for a moment)

RAOUL (quietly, half to himself, half to the box)

A collector's piece indeed . . 
every detail exactly as she said . . .

She often spoke of you, my friend ....
Your velvet lining, and your figurine of lead...

Will you still play, when all the rest of us are dead?

(Attention returns to the AUCTIONEER, as he resumes)

AUCTIONEER

(spoken) Lot 666, then: a chandelier in pieces. 
Some of you may recall the strange affair of the Phantom of the Opera: 
a mystery never fully explained. 
We are told ladies and gentlemen, 
that this is the very chandelier which figures in the famous disaster. 
Our workshops have restored it 
and fitted up parts of it with wiring for the new electric light, 
so that we may get a hint of what it may look like when re- assembled. 
Perhaps we may frighten away the ghost of 
so many years ago with a little illumination, gentlemen?

(The AUCTIONEER switches on the chandelier. 
There is an enormous flash, and the OVERTURE begins. 
During the overture the opera house is restored to its earlier grandeur. 
The chandelier immense and glittering, rises magically fromthe stage, 
finally hovering high above the stalls)

Overture/Hannibal       
            CARLOTTA: 
This trophy from our saviours, from our saviours from the enslaving force of Rome! 

GIRL'S CHORUS: 
With feasting and dancing and song, tonight in celebration, 
We greet the victorious throng, returned to bring salvation!

MEN'S CHORUS:
The trumpets of Carthage resound! Hear, Romans, now and tremble! 
Hark to our step on the ground!

ALL: 
Hear the drums, Hannibal comes!

PIANGI: 
Sad to return to find the land we love threatened once more by Roma's far-reaching grasp

REYER: 
Gentlemen, gentlemen...

LEFEVRE: 
Rehearsals, as you see, are under way, for a new production of Chalumeau's "Hannibal".

REYER: 
Monsieur Lefevre, I am rehearsing.

LEFEVRE: 
Monsieur Reyer, Madame Giry, ladies and gentlemen, 
Please if I could have your attention, thank you.

As you know, for some weeks there have been rumours of my imminent retirement. 
I can now tell you that these were all true and it is my pleasure to introduce you to the two gentlemen
Who now own the Opera Populaire, Monsieur Richard Firmin and Monsieur Gilles Andre.

FIRMIN:
And we are deeply honoured to introduce our new patron, the Vicomte de Changy

RAOUL:
My parents and I are honoured to support all the arts especially the world renowned Opera Populaire

LEFEVRE:
Vicomte, Gentlemen, Signora Carlotta Giudicelli, our leading soprano for five seasons now.
And Signor Ubaldo Piangi.

RAOUL: 
An honour, Signor. I believe I'm keeping you from your rehearsal. 
I will be here this evening to share your great triumph. My apologies, monsieur.

REYER:
Thank you, Monsieur Le Vicomte. Once more if you please, signor.

CARLOTTA:
He loves me!

GIRY: 
We take a particular pride here in the excellence of our ballets, monsieur

FIRMIN:
I see why, especially that little blonde angel.

GIRY: 
My daughter, Meg Giry. 

FIRMIN: 
And that exceptional beauty? No relation, I trust.

GIRY: 
Christine DaaÃ©, promising talent, Monsieur Firmin, very promising.

FIRMIN: 
DaaÃ©, you say? No relation to the famous Swedish violinist?

GIRY:
His only child, orphan at 7, when she came to live and train in the ballet dormitory.

FIRMIN:
An orphan, you say!

CHORUS: 
Bid welcome to Hannibal's guests, the elephants of Carthage! 
As guides on our conquering quests, Dido sends Hannibal's friends!

CHORUS WITH CARLOTTA AND PIANGI:
The trumpeting elephants sound, hear, Romans, now and tremble! 
Hark to their step on the ground, hear the drums! Hannibal comes!

ANDRE: 
Mosieur Reyer, isn't there a rather marvelous aria for Elissa in Act Three of "Hannibal"?
Perhaps if Signora...

CARLOTTA: 
Yes...Yes...Monsieur Reyer?

REYER: 
If my diva commands. 

CARLOTTA: 
Yes I do.

Think of Me       
            CHRISTINE:
Think of me, think of me fondly,
when we've said goodbye.
Remember me once in a while -
please promise me you'll try.
When you find that, once again, you long
to take your heart back and be free -
if you ever find a moment,
spare a thought for me

We never said our love was evergreen,
or as unchanging as the sea -
but if you can still remember
stop and think of me . . .

Think of all the things
we've shared and seen -
don't think about the way things
might have been . . .

Think of me, think of me waking,
silent and resigned.
Imagine me, trying too hard
to put you from my mind.
Recall those days
look back on all those times,
think of the things we'll never do -
there will never be a day,
when I won't think of you . . .

RAOUL:
Can it be? Can it be Christine?
Bravo!
Long ago, it seems so long ago
How young and innocent we were...
She may not remember me,
but I remember her...

CHRISTINE
Flowers fade, 
The fruits of summer fade, 
They have their seasons, so do we
but please promise me, that sometimes
you will think of me!

Where in the world have you been hiding
Really, you were perfect
I only wish I knew your secret
Who is your great tutor

CHRISTINE
Meg 
When your mother brought me here to live
Whenever Iâd come down here alone
To light a candle for my father
A voice from above
And in my dreams
He was always there
You see, when my father lay dying
He told me I will be protected by an angel
An angel of music

MEG
Christine, do you believe?
Do you think the spirit of your father is coaching you?

CHRISTINE 
who else, meg?
Father once spoke of an angel
I used to dream he'd appear
Now as I sing, I can sense him
And I know he's here
Here in this room he calls me softly
Somewhere inside hiding
Somehow I know he's always with me
He, the unseen genius

MEG
Christine, you must have been dreaming
Stories like this can't come true
Christine, you are talking in riddles
And it's not like you

Thank you

Music of the Night       
            Night time sharpens, 
Heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses 
Abandon their defenses

Slowly gently, night unfurls
Its splendour
Grasp it, sense it, 
Tremulous and tender

Turn your face away 
From the garish light of day, 
Turn your thoughts away 
From cold unfeeling light 
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and 
Surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life
You knew before 
Close your eyes, 
Let your spirit start to soar

And you'll live as you've 
Never lived before

Softly, deftly
Music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it 
Secretly possess you

Open up your mind 
Let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know 
You can not fight,
The darkness of 
The music of the night

Let your mind start a journey 
Through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world
You knew before
Let your soul take 
You where you long to be

Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling
Sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me
Savor each sensation
Let the dream begin
Let your darker side give in
To the power of 
The music that I write
The power of 
The music of the night 

You alone can make 
My song take flight 
Help me make the 
Music of the night

Magical Lasso

I Remember/Stranger Than You Dreamt It       
            CHRISTINE 
I remember there was mist
swirling mist upon a vast, glassy lake
There were candles all around,
and on the lake there was a boat,
and in the boat there was a man

Who was that shape in the shadows?
Whose is the face in the mask?

PHANTOM
D*** you! 
You little prying Pandora!
You little demon
Is this what you wanted to see?
Curse you!
You little lying Delilah!
You little viper
Now you cannot ever be free! 

D*** you...
Curse you...

Stranger than you dreamt it
Can you even dare to look
or bare to think of me:
this loathsome gargoyle, who burns in h***,
but secretly yearns for heaven,
secretly... secretly...
Christine...

Fear can turn to love - you'll learn to see
to find the man behind the monster:
this repulsive carcass, who seems a beast
but secretly dreams of beauty, 
secretly... secretly... 
Oh, Christine...

Come, we must return
Those two fools Who run my
theater will be missing you.

Notes/Prima Donna       
            Firmin
"Mystery after gala night," it says, "mystery of sopranos flight".
"Mystified," all the papers say, "We are mystified. We suspect foul play!"
Bad news on soprano scene
First Carlotta, now Christine.
Still at least the seats get sold,
Gossip's worth its weight in gold.
What a way to run a business
Spare me these unending trials
Half your cast disappears
But the crowd still cheers
Opera!
To hell with Gluck and Handel
Have a scandal and you're sure to have a hit!

Andre
Damnable!
Will they all walk out?
This is damnable!

Firmin
Andre please don't shout
It's publicity and the take is vast
Free publicity

Andre
But we have no cast!

Firmin
Andre have you seen the queue
Ah, it seems you've got one too

Andre
"Dear Andre what a charming gala,
Christine was in a word sublime
We were hardly bereft when Carlotta left
On that note: The diva's a disaster,
Must you cast her when she's seasons past her prime?"

Firmin
"Dear Firmin just a brief reminder;
My salary has not been paid
Send it care of the ghost
By return of post
P.T.O No one likes a debter so it's better if my orders are obeyed!"

Andre & Firmin
Who would have the gall to send this?
Someone with a puerile brain
These are both signed O.G
Who the hell is he?
Opera Ghost!

Firmin
It is nothing short of shocking

Andre
He is mocking our position

Firmin
In addition he wants money

Andre
What a funny apparition

Andre & Firmin
To expect a large retainer
Nothing plainer
He is clearly quite insane

Raoul
Where is she?

Andre
You mean Carlotta?

Raoul
I mean Miss Daae.
Where is she?

Firmin
Well how should we know?

Raoul
I want an answer
I take it that you sent me this note

Andre
What all this nonsense?
Of course not

Firmin
Don't look at us

Raoul
She's not with you then?

Firmin
Of course not

Andre
We're in the dark

Raoul
Monsieur don't argue
Isn't this the letter you wrote

Firmin
And what is is that we're meant to have wrote?
...Written!

Andre
D"o not fear for Miss Daae
The Angel of Music has her under his wing
Make no attempt to see her again."

Raoul
If you didn't write it then who did?

Carlotta
Where is he?

Andre
Ah, welcome back!

Carlotta & Piangi
Where is he?
Your precious patron
Where is he?

Raoul
What is it now?

Carlotta
I have your letter
A letter that which I rather resent

Firmin
And did you send it?

Raoul
Of course not!

Andre
As if he would

Carlotta & Piangi
You didn't send it?

Raoul
Of course not!

Firmin
What going on?

Carlotta
You dare to tell me
That this is not the letter you sent

Raoul
And what is it that I'm meant to have sent?
"Your days at the Opera Populaire are numbered.
Christine Daae will be singing on your behalf tonight.
Be prepared for a great misfortune should you attempt to take her place."

Andre & Firmin
Far too many notes for my taste
And most of them about Christine
All we've heard since we came
Is Miss Daae's name

Madame Giry
Miss Daae has returned

Firmin
No worse for wear as far as we're concerned

Andre
Where precisely is she now?

Madame Giry
I thought it best she was alone

Meg
She needed rest

Raoul
May I see her?

Madame Giry
No monsieur she will see no one

Carlotta & Piangi
Will she sing?
Will she sing?

Madame Giry
Here I have a note

All (except Madame Giry and Meg)
Let me see it

Firmin
Please
"Gentlemen, I have now sent you several notes of the most aimnable nature detailing how my Opera House is to be run
You have ignored my orders...

Phantom
...I shall give you one last chance
Christine Daae has returned to you
And I am anxious her career should progress
In the new production of Il Muto
You will therefore cast Carlotta as the page boy
And put Miss Daae in the role of Countess
The role which Miss Daae plays calls for charm and appeal
The role of the page boy is silent which makes my casting in a word, ideal
I shall watch the performance from my normal seat in box 5 which will be kept empty for me
Should these commands be ignored a disaster beyond your imagination will occur
I remain, gentlemen, your obedient servant

Prima Donna your song shall live again

Andre & Firmin
Think of your public

Carlotta
You took a snub but there's a public who needs you

Madame Giry
She has heard the voice of the Angel of Music

Andre & Firmin
Those who hear you liken you to an angel

Carlotta
Think of the cry of undying support

We get her Opera

Firmin
She gets her limelight

Carlotta
Follow where the lime light leads you

Andre & Firmin
Leading ladies are a trial

Carlotta
Prima Donna your song shall never die
You'll sing again and to unending ovation

Raoul

Andre & Firmin
This misacating will invite damnation
Lunatic demands are regular occurences

Carlotta
Think how you'll sing in that final encore

Andre & Firmin
Sing Prima Donna once more

Raoul
I must see these demands are rejected

Andre & Firmin
Who'd believe a diva happy to relieve
A chorus girl whose gone and slept with the patron?
Raoul and the soubrette, entwined in love's duet!
Although he may demur, he must have been with her!

Carlotta
Fortunata!
Non ancor abbandonata!

Andre & Firmin
You'd never get away with all this in a play,
but if it's loudly sung and in a foreign tongue
It's just the sort of story audiences adore, in fact a perfect opera!

Meg & Christine
For if his curse is on this Opera

All
Prima Donna the world is at your feet
A nation waits, and how it hates to be cheated!
Light Up the stage with that age-old rapport,
Sing Prima Donna
Once more!

Phantom
So, it is to be war between us. If these demands are not met,  a disaster beyond imagination will occur! 

All

This faithless lady's bound for HADES!
Shame! Shame! Shame!
Serafimo - your disguise is perfect.
Who can this be? 
Gentle wife, admit your loving husband.
My love - I am called to England on affairs of State, 
And must leave you with your new maid.
Though I'd happily take the maid with me.
The old fool's leaving!
Serafimo - away with this pretence!
You cannot speak, but kiss me in my husband's absence!
Poor fool, he makes me laugh!
Haha, Haha...
Time I tried to get a better better half!
Poor fool, he doesn't know!
Hoho, Hoho...
If he knew the truth, he'd never, ever go!
Did I not instruct that Box Five was to be kept empty?
He's here: the Phantom of the Opera ...
It's him
Your part is silent, little toad! 
A toad, madame? Perhaps it is you who are the toad ...
Serafimo, away with this pretence!
You cannot speak, but kiss me in my ...
Poor fool, he makes me laugh -

Croak, croak, croak, croak, croak, croak
Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize, the performance will continue in ten minutes' time ... 
... when the role of the Countess will be played by Miss Christine Daae.
Meanwhile, we'd like to give you the ballet from Act Three of tonight's opera.
Are you alright?
Raoul, we're not safe here
Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats.
Do not panic.
It was an accident ... simply an accident

Why Have You Brought Me Here/Raoul I've Been There       
            RAOUL
Why have you brought me here?

CHRISTINE
Canât go back there!

RAOUL
We must return!

CHRISTINE
He'll kill you!
His eyes will find us there!

RAOUL
Christine, don't say that.
CHRISTINE
Those eyes that burn!

RAOUL
Don't even think it

CHRISTINE
And if he has to kill a thousand men

RAOUL
Forget this waking nightmare...

CHRISTINE
The Phantom of the Opera will kill...

RAOUL
This phantom is a fable
Believe me

CHRISTINE
...and kill again!

RAOUL
There is no Phantom of the Opera

BOTH
My God, who is this man...

CHRISTINE
...who hunts to kill?

RAOUL
...this mask of death?

CHRISTINE
I can't escape from him...

RAOUL
Whose is this voice you hear...

CHRISTINE
...I never will!

RAOUL
...with every breath?

BOTH
And in this labyrinth,
where night is blind
the Phantom of the Opera is here/there
inside my/your mind...

RAOUL
There is no Phantom of the Opera...

CHRISTINE
Raoul, I've been there
to his world of unending night
To a world with the daylight dissolves into darkness...
darkness...
Raoul, I've seen him!
Can I ever forget that sight?
Can I ever escape from that face?
So distorted, deformed, it was hardly a face
in that darkness...
darkness...
But his voice filled my spirit
with a strange, sweet sound...
In that night there was music in my mind...
And through music my soul began to soar!
And I heard as I'd never heard before...

RAOUL
What you heard was a dream and nothing more...

CHRISTINE
Yet in his eyes
all the sadness of the world
Those pleading eyes,
that both threaten and adore

RAOUL
Christine...
Christine...

PHANTOM
Christine...

CHRISTINE
(whisper) What was that?

All I Ask of You       
            RAOUL
No more talk of darkness,
Forget these wide-eyed fears
I'm here, nothing can harm you
my words will warm and calm you
Let me be your freedom,
let daylight dry your tears.
I'm here with you, beside you,
to guard you and to guide you...

CHRISTINE
Say you love me every waking moment,
turn my head with talk of summertime...
Say you need me with you now and always...
Promise me that all you say is true
that's all I ask of you

RAOUL
Let me be your shelter
let me be your light
You're safe, No one will find you
your fears are far behind you...

CHRISTINE
All I want is freedom,
a world with no more night
and you, always beside me, to hold me and to hide me...

RAOUL
Then say you'll share with me
one love, one lifetime
let me lead you from your solitude
Say you need me with you here, beside you...
anywhere you go, let me go too
Christine, that's all I ask of you...

CHRISTINE
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime...
say the word and I will follow you...
(right) BOTH:
Share each day with me,
each night, each morning...
(right) CHRISTINE
Say you love me...

You know I do...

BOTH
Love me - that's all I ask of you
Anywhere you go let me go too
Love me - that's all I ask of you...

Masquerade! Hide your face so the world will never find you
Masquerade! Every face a different shade
Masquerade! Look around, there's another mask behind you.

Flash of mauve
Splash of puce
Fool and king
Ghoul and goose
Green and black
Queen and priest
Trace of rouge
Face of beast
Faces!
Take your turn, take a ride
On the merry-go-round
in an inhuman race
Eye of gold
Thigh of blue
True is false
Who is who?
Curl of lip
Swirl of gown
Ace of hearts
Face of clown
Faces! Drink it in, drink it up
Till you've drowned
In the light
In the sound
But who can name the face?

Masquerade! Grinning yellows, spinning reds
Masquerade! Take your fill, let the spectacle astound you

Masquerade! Leering satyrs, peering eyes
Masquerade! Run and hide, but a face will still pursue you.

Why so silent, good monsieurs?
Did you think that I had left you for good?
Have you missed me, good monsieurs?
I have written you an opera.
Here, I bring the finish score.
Don Juan Triumphant!
Fondest greetings to you all
A few instructions just before rehearsal starts
Carlotta must be taught to act
Not her normal trick of strutting 'round the stage
Our Don Juan must loose some weight
It's not healthy in a man of Piangi's age
And my managers must learn that their place is in an office
Not the arts
As for our star, Miss Christine Daae...

No doubt she'll do her best/It's true, her voice is good
She knows, though
Should she wish to excell
She has much still to learn
If pride will let her return to me, her teacher
Her teacher...

Your chains are still mine, you belong to me!

Madame Giry's Tale/The Fairground       
            RAOUL: 
Madame Giry. Wait!

GIRY: 
Please, Monsieur, I don't know more than anyone else.

RAOUL: 
That's not true.

GIRY: 
Monsieur, don't ask. There have been too many accidents.

RAOUL: 
Accidents?! Please, Madame Giry, for all our sakes.

GIRY: 
Very well. It was years ago. There was a travelling fair in the city, Gypsies.
I was very young, studying to be a ballerina, 
One of many living in the dormitory of the opera house.
I hid him from the world and its cruelties. 
He has known nothing else of life since then.
As if this opera house, it was his playground and, now, his artistic domain.
He's a genius. He's an architect and designer. 
He's a composer and a magician. A genius, monsieur.

RAOUL:
Clearly, Madame Giry, genius has turned to madness.

To my father's grave, please.

In sleep he sang to me, in dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name...

Little Lotte thought of everything and nothing
Her Father promised her that he would send her the Angel of Music
Her father promised her? Her father promised her...

Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again       
            You were once my one companion
You were all that mattered
You were once a friend and father
Then my world was shattered

Wishing you were somehow here again
Wishing you were somehow near
Sometimes it seem if I just dream
Somehow you would be here

Wishing I could hear your voice again 
Knowing that I never would
Dreaming of you won't help me to do
All that you dreamed I could

Passing bells and sculpted angels
Cold and monumental
Seem for you the wrong companions
You were warm and gentle

Too many years
Fighting back tears
Why can't the past just die

Wishing you were somehow here again
Knowing we must say goodbye
Try to forgive teach me to live 
Give me the strength to try
No more memories no more silent tears
No more gazing across the wasted years
Help me say goodbye'.

Wandering Child       
            The PHANTOM emerges from behind the cross)
PHANTOM (very soft and enticing)
Wandering child . . .
So lost . . .
So helpless . . .
Yearning for my
Guidance . . .

(Bewildered, CHRISTINE looks up, and murmurs
breathlessly):

CHRISTINE
Angel . . . or father . . .
Friend . . . or
Phantom . . . ?
Who is it there,
Staring . . . ?

PHANTOM (more and more hypnotic)
Have you forgotten your Angel . . .?

CHRISTINE
Angel . . . oh, speak . . .
What endless longings
Echo in this whisper . . .!

(RAOUL appears in the shadows and watches for a moment transfixed)

PHANTOM (now drawing CHRISTINE towards him)
Too long you've wandered in winter . . .
RAOUL (to himself a murmur)
Once again
She is his . . .

PHANTOM
Far from my far-reaching gaze . . .

RAOUL
Once again she returns . . .

CHRISTINE (increasingly mesmerized)
Wildly my mind beats against you . . .

PHANTOM
You resist . . .

PHANTOM/CHRISTINE
Yet your/the soul 
Obeys . . .

RAOUL
. . . to the arms
Of her angel . . .
Angel or demon . . .
Still he calls her . . .
Luring her back, from the grave . . .
Angel or dark seducer . . .?
Who are you, strange
Angel . . .?

PHANTOM
Angel of Music!
You denied me/I denied you
Turning from true beauty . . .
Angel of Music!
Do not shun me/My protector . . .
Come to your strange
Angel . . .

CHRISTINE
Angel of Music!

(CHRISTINE moves towards the figure of the
PHANTOM)

PHANTOM (beckoning her)
I am your Angel of Music . . .
Come to me: Angel of Music . . .

RAOUL (suddenly calling out)
Angel of darkness!
Cease this torment!

(Inexorably the PHANTOM continues to beckon
CHRISTINE)

PHANTOM
I am your Angel of Music . . .
Come to me: Angel of Music . . .

RAOUL (in desperation)
Christine! Christine listen to me!
Whatever you may believe, this man . . .
this thing . . . is not your father!
(to the PHANTOM)
Let her go! For God's sake, let her go! Christine !
(Coming out of her trance CHRISTINE turns and
mouths the words):

We Hall All Been Blind       
            Raoul: 
We have all been blind and yet the answer is staring us in the face. 
This could be the chance to ensnare our clever friend. 

Firmin and Andre: 
We're listening. Go on. 

Raoul:
We shall play his game, perform his work, but remember we hold the ace. 
For if Ms. Daae sings, he is certain to attend.

Firmin/Andre: 
We are certain the doors are barred. 
We are certain the police are there.

Raoul:
We are certain they're armed.

Firmin/Andre/Raoul: 
The curtain falls, his reign will end.

Christine (speaking): 
Raoul I'm frightened. Don't make me do this. It scares me. 
Don't put me through this ordeal by fire.
He'll take me. I know. We'll be parted forever. He won't let me go. 
What I once used to dream, I now dread. If he finds me it won't ever end. 
(singing) 
And he'll always be there singing songs in my head. 
He'll always be there singing songs in my head. 

Raoul:
You said yourself he was nothing but a man, 
yet while he lives he will haunt us 'til we're dead.

Christine: 
Twisted every way, what answer can I give? 
Am I to risk my life to win the chance to live? 
Can I betray the man who once inspired my voice? 
Do I become his prey? Do I have any choice? 
He kills without a thought. He murders all that's good. 
I know I can't refuse, and yet I wish I could. 
Oh God, if I agree what horrors wait for me, in this, the Phantom's opera?

Raoul: 
Christine, Christine don't think that I don't care, 
but every hope, and every prayer rests on you now.

Phantom: 
Seal my fate tonight. I hate to have to cut the fun short. 
But the jokes wearing thin, let the audience in, let my opera begin.

A Rehearsal for Don Juan Triumphant       
            CHORUS

Here the sire may serve the dam,
here the master takes his meat!
Here the sacrificial lamb
utters one despairing bleat!

CARLOTTA AND CHORUS

Poor young maiden! For the thrill
on your tongue of stolen sweets
you will have to pay the bill -
tangled in the winding sheets!

Serve the meal and serve the maid!
Serve the master so that, when
tables, plans and maids are laid,
Don Juan triumphs once again!

(SIGNOR PIANGI, as Don Juan, emerges from behind the arch. 
MEG, a gypsy dancer pirouettes coquettishly for him.
He throws her a purse. She catches it and leaves)

DON JUAN

Passarino, faithful friend,
once again recite the plan.

PASSARINO

Your young guest believes I'm you -
I, the master, you, the man.

DON JUAN

When you met you wore my cloak,
with my scarf you hid your face.
She believes she dines with me,
in her master's borrowed place!
Furtively, we'll scoff and quaff,
stealing what, in truth, is mine.
When it's late and modesty
starts to mellow, with the wine . . .

PASSARINO

You come home! I use your voice -
slam the door like crack of doom!

DON JUAN

I shall say: "come - hide with me!
Where, oh, where? Of course - my room!"

PASSARINO

Poor thing hasn't got a chance!

DON JUAN

Here's my hat, my cloak and sword.
Conquest is assured,
if I do not forget myself and laugh . . .

(DON JUAN puts on PASSARINO's cloak 
and goes into the curtained alcove where the bed awaits. 
Although we do not yet know it, the Punjab Lasso has done its work, 
and SIGNOR PIANGI is no more. 
When next we see DON JUAN, it will be the PHANTOM.
Meanwhile, we hear AMINTA (CHRISTINE) singing happily in the distance)

AMINTA (CHRISTINE - offstage, entering)

". . . no thoughts
within her head,
but thoughts of joy!
No dreams
within her heart
but dreams of love!"

PASSARINO (onstage)

Master?

DON JUAN (PHANTOM - behind the curtain)

Passarino - go away!
For the trap is set and waits for its prey . . .

(PASSARINO leaves. CHRISTINE (AMINTA) enters. 
She takes off her cloak and sits down. Looks about her. No one. 
She starts on an apple. 
The PHANTOM, disguised as DON JUAN pretending to be PASSARINO, 
emerges. 
He now wears PASSARINO's robe, the cowl of which hides his face. 
His first words startle her)

DON JUAN (PHANTOM)

You have come here
in pursuit of
your deepest urge,
in pursuit of
that wish,
which till now
has been silent,
silent . . .

I have brought you,
that our passions
may fuse and merge -
in your mind
you've already
succumbed to me
dropped all defences
completely succumbed to me -
now you are here with me:
no second thoughts,
you've decided,
decided . . .

Past the point
of no return -
no backward glances:
the games we've played
till now are at
an end . . .
Past all thought
of "if" or "when" -
no use resisting:
abandon thought,
and let the dream
descend . . .

What raging fire
shall flood the soul?
What rich desire
unlocks its door?
What sweet seduction
lies before
us . . .?

Past the point
of no return,
the final threshold -
what warm,
unspoken secrets
will we learn?
Beyond the point
of no return . . .

AMINTA (CHRISTINE)

You have brought me
to that moment
where words run dry,
to that moment
where speech
disappears
into silence,
silence . . .

I have come here,
hardly knowing
the reason why . . .
In my mind,
I've already
imagined our
bodies entwining
defenceless and silent -
and now I am
here with you:
no second thoughts,


I've decided,
decided . . .

Past the point
of no return -
no going back now:
our passion-play
has now, at last,
begun . . .
Past all thought
of right or wrong -
one final question:
how long should we
two wait, before
we're one . . .?

When will the blood
begin to race
the sleeping bud
burst into bloom?
When will the flames,
at last, consume
us . . .?

BOTH

Past the point
of no return
the final threshold -
the bridge
is crossed, so stand
and watch it burn . . .
We've passed the point
of no return . . .

(By now the audience and the POLICE have realised 
that SIGNOR PIANGI is dead behind the curtain, 
and it is the PHANTOM who sings in his place. 
CHRISTINE knows it too. As final confirmation, the PHANTOM sings)

PHANTOM

Say you'll share with
me one
love, one lifetime . . .
Lead me, save me
from my solitude . . .

(He takes from his finger a ring and holds it out to her. 
Slowly she takes it and puts it on her finger.)

Say you want me
with you,
here beside you . . .
Anywhere you go
let me go too -
Christine
that's all I ask of . . .

(We never reach the word 'you', 
for CHRISTINE quite calmly reveals the PHANTOM'S face to the audience. 
As the FORCES OF LAW close in on the horrifying skull, 
the PHANTOM sweeps his cloak around her and vanishes.

MEG pulls the curtain upstage, revealing PIANGI'S body garotted, 
propped against the bed, his head gruesomely tilted to one side. 
She screams.)

TRANSFORMATION TO:

REVERSE VIEW OF THE STAGE
(POLICE, STAGEHANDS, etc. rush onto the stage in confusion. 
Also: ANDRE, FIRMIN, RAOUL, GIRY, CARLOTTA and MEG)

CARLOTTA

What is it? What has happened? Ubaldo!

ANDRE

Oh, my God . . . my God . . .

FIRMIN

We're ruined, Andre - ruined!

GIRY (to RAOUL)

Monsieur le Vicomte! Come with me!

CARLOTTA (rushing over to PIANGI's body)

Oh, my darling, my darling . . . who has done
this ...?

(Hysterical, attacking ANDRE)

You! Why did you let this happen?

(She breaks down, as PIANGI's body is carried off on a stretcher)

GIRY

Monsieur le Vicomte, I know where they are.

RAOUL

But can I trust you?

GIRY

You must. But remember: your hand at the level of
your eyes!

RAOUL

But why . . .?

GIRY

Why? The Punjab lasso, monsieur. First Buquet. Now Piangi.

MEG (holding up her hand)

Like this, monsieur. I'll come with you.

GIRY

No, Meg! No, you stay here!

(To RAOUL)

Come with me, monsieur. Hurry, or we shall be too
late . . .

Say you want me here beside you...
Anywhere you go let me come too...
Christine, that's all i ask of...

RAOUL: Oh my god, Oh my god

MADAME GIRY:
Monsieur Le Vicomte, come with me
Monsieur Le Vicomte I know where they are.

RAOUL: 
But can I trust you?

MADAME GIRY:
You must, but remember your hand atthe level of your eyes...

RAOUL: 
Why?

MEG: 
I'll come with you

MADAME GIRY:
No Meg you must stay here. Come with me Monsieur, hurry or we shall be too late.

PHANTOM: 
Down once more to the dungeon of my black despair! 
Down we plunge to the prison of my mind! 
Down that path into darkness deep as hell! 
Why, you ask, was I bound and chained in this cold and dismal place? 
Not for any mortal sin, but the wickedness of my abhorrent face! 

CHORUS:
Track down this murderer! 
He must be found! 

PHANTOM:
Hounded out by everyone! 
Met with hatred everywhere! 
No kind word from anyone! 
No compassion anywhere! 
Christine, Christine ... 
Why, why ...?

MADAME GIRY: 
Your hand at the level of your eyes! 
... at the level of your eyes ... 

CHORUS:
Track down this murderer he must be found! 
Track down this murderer he must be found!
Hunt out this animal, who runs to ground! Too long he's preyed on us, but now we know, the phantom of the opera is here deep
down inside! 
He's here the Phantom of the Opera...
He's here the Phantom of the Opera...

CHRISTINE:
Have you gorged yourself at last in your lust for blood? 
Am I now to be prey to your lust for flesh? 

PHANTOM:
That fate which condemns me to wallow in blood, has also denied me the joys of the flesh ... 
This face - the infection which poisons our love ... 
This face, which earned a mother's fear and loathing ... 
A mask, my first unfeeling scrap of clothing ... 
Pity comes too late - turn around 
and face your fate: an eternity of this before your eyes! 

CHRISTINE:
This haunted face holds no horror for me now ... 
It's in your soul that the true distortion lies ... 

PHANTOM:
Wait! I think, my dear, we have a guest!
Sir, this is indeed an unparalleled delight! 
I had rather hoped that you would come. 
And now my wish comes true - you have truly made my night! 

RAOUL:
Free her! 
Do what you like only free her! 
Have you no pity? 

PHANTOM:
Your lover makes a passionate plea! 

CHRISTINE:
Please Raoul, it's useless!

RAOUL:
I love her! 
Does that mean nothing? 
I love her! 
Show some compassion ... 

PHANTOM:
The world showed no compassion to me! 

RAOUL:
Christine, Christine...
Let me see her... 

PHANTOM:
Be my guest, sir ... 
Monsieur, I bid you welcome! 
Did you think that I would harm her? 
Why should I make her pay for the sins which are yours? 
Order your fine horses now! 
Raise up your hand to the level of your eyes! 
Nothing can save you now - except perhaps Christine... 
Start a new life with me - 
Buy his freedom with your love! 
Refuse me, and you send your lover to his death! 
This is the choice - 
This is the point of no return! 

CHRISTINE:
The tears I might have shed for your dark fate grow cold, and turn to tears of hate! 

RAOUL:
Christine, forgive me please forgive me ... 
I did it all for you, and all for nothing ... 

CHRISTINE:
Farewell my fallen idol and false friend ... 
We had such hopes, and now those hopes are shattered!

PHANTOM: 
Too late for turning back, too late for prayers and useless pity!

RAOUL:
Say you love him and my life is over

PHANTOM:
All hope of cries for help; no point in fighting!

RAOUL/PHANTOM:
For either way you choose, he has to win/you cannot win! 

PHANTOM:
So, do you end your days with me, 
or do you send him to his grave? 

RAOUL:
Why make her lie to you, to save me? 

CHRISTINE:
Angel of Music... 

PHANTOM:
Past the point of no return - 

RAOUL:
For pity's sake, 
Christine, say no! 

CHRISTINE:
...who deserves this? 

PHANTOM:
... the final threshold... 

RAOUL:
Don't throw your life away for my sake!

CHRISTINE:
When will you see reason ...? 

PHANTOM:
His life is now the prize which you must earn!

RAOUL:
I fought so hard to free you ... 

CHRISTINE:
Angel of Music ...

PHANTOM:
You've passed the point of no return ... 

CHRISTINE:
... you deceived me. 
I gave my mind blindly. 

PHANTOM:
You try my patience - make your choice! 

CHRISTINE:
Pitiful creature of darkness... 
What kind of life have you known? 
God give me courage to show you you are not alone... 

CHORUS:
Track down this murderer he must be found!
Hunt out this animal, who runs to ground! Too long he's preyed on us, but now we know, the phantom of the opera is there
deep down inside! 

PHANTOM:
Take her - forget me - forget all of this... 
Leave me alone - forget all you've seen... 
Go now - don't let them find you! 
Take the boat - leave me know, swear never to tell, the secrets you know, of the angel in hell
GO NOW! 
GO NOW AND LEAVE ME!
Masquerade... 
Paper faces on parade... 
Masquerade... 
Hide your face so the world will never find you... 
Christine, I love you... 

CHRISTINE:
Say you'll share with me, one love, one lifetime...
Say the word and I will follow you... 

RAOUL:
Share each day with me

CHRISTINE:
each night, 

RAOUL/CHRISTINE:
each morning... 

PHANTOM:
You alone can make my song take flight - 
it's over now, the music of the night!
