Or doesnât want to get acquainted in person because he is cynical. But is it possible to really fall in love, communicating only through the Internet? If you do not see your interlocutor's eyes in reality, nor hear his or her laughter, how can you feel close to your half? Though the virtual communication has its advantages. The ability to know closer the person, not paying attention to the appearance, helps to understand better your interlocutor. Many people donât give a difference to how their Internet-companion looks or smells like, if they are on a common wave. Honesty, it is the only important condition in the virtual communication. But you have to be cautious â even a small lie, said at the beginning of acquaintance, eventually becomes a huge lump of it, when you decide to meet in the reality.
