"Scarlet Pimpernel, The" Review - Broadway musical                                  
    At the heart of the musical is the eponymous novel by Baroness Emma Orczy, written by her in 1905. The first Broadway production was extremely unfortunate. Critics have recognized this production unviable. After the failure of the show, it was decided to replace the director and choreographer. In their place, they have invited R. Longbottom. The musical has undergone significant reorganization â its story has been rewritten and revised. Typically, such changes were practiced in trial productions, first taking place on the stages of regional theaters. The public first saw revising of an unsuccessful production during its Broadway depiction.

Critics appreciated significant changes in the new production. In their opinion, the revised show was more vivid. A romantic story line was now clearly seen in the play. Also, choreography of staging improved. But the second version of the production was not ideal too. The third version of the play the same did not bring the expected success to a show. All Broadway productions have not paid off and were closed with losses. Cash collections for the last weekend of the Broadway show (as of Jan. 2, 2000) amounted to 356,377 dollars, which was almost 2 times less than the amount planned by the organizers â USD 674,621. 

Despite the modest gains on Broadway, a musical acquired permanent fans. Music by F. Wildhorn that has created romantic ballads, was appreciated by the viewers. Staging has been attributed to the category of family musicals â its adventure scenes and fights with swords especially liked children. Also, quite a serious set design was created in this piece â in one number on the stage appeared even a whole ship! Play was three times nominated for Tony, four â on Outer Critics Circle Award, twice â on Drama Desk and once â on Drama League. But was rewarded only with Theatre World Award.
