And in spite of the fact that the mother tells her to adopt the provision and to be content with what she has, Georgia dreams to become the best. It is an incredibly resistant character. Despite of all difficulties, a girl goes forward. And the actress who played this role faultlessly, could report the character of this girl. Fervent, cheerful â she arouses only positive emotions.
