Dressed in identical classical gray Sarah Beers' suits, main characters with all their cast of look and mind show as people are identical in loosing something, and doesn't matter, what exactly they have lost. Inimitable Jennifer R. Morris, as the girl who lost her favorite shoes, explains that even the most ordinary thing can be a mascot for her owner. Moreover, a bright role of the police officer, performing by Stephen Plunkett, who tells about missing parts of a body.

Sentimental scenes also exist, including perfect Colleen Werthmannâs telling of a touching story about the girl, who lost a doll. Anyway, it can't leave public indifferent, after all, but at least one of the stories will cut into the brains quickly.

The musical turned out really whimsical. No wonder, why it has received so many enthusiastic comments of well-known American magazines. It is impossible to come off so excellent played life occurring on a scene in front of your eyes.
