"Light in the Piazza" Review - Broadway musical                                  
    Good old neo-romanticism comes back on Broadway. Musicalâs success is easily explained by the fact that the audience missed the tragic stories of unrequited love. The creators deliberately refused pathos and shine on the stage, which was typical for the projects like Mamma Mia!, Jersey Boys and others. According to one of the actors, director of production set the emphasis on creation of a touching performance that can interest viewer of any kind. 

Clear structure, bright main characters â the elements, which are missing to connoisseurs of the genre. Very rarely the viewer feels sympathy almost to all the characters of the play. Clara embodies innocence, Fabrizio â passion and an irresistible thirst for love. Even Margaret, which often becomes an obstacle in the relationship of the main characters, does this not out of malice, but because of maternal care. Other subtle characters also cause positive emotions. The exception is, perhaps, Roy Johnson, who has little interest in the fate of his sick daughter. 

Musical accompaniment is considered the main attraction of this production. Chic voices and approaching to opera singing leave a strong impression. The composer applied a rather interesting solution, not limited with exclusively English songs. In a musical, a number of songs were in Italian. The latter not only sound beautifully, but also help to create the atmosphere of real Florence. Particularly impressive song is Il Mondo Era Vuoto. In it, a young Italian shares the fear of losing his beloved Clara forever. The Light In The Piazza is a unique creation, reiterating to the classic roots of the genre. This is a true and rather dramatic story, describing wonderful feeling.
