"Rent" Review - Broadway musical                                  
    The idea to create a musical based on the opera of Giacomo Puccini âLa BohÃ¨meâ belonged to the playwright B. Aronson. A year later â in 1989 â he began working with 29-year-old composer J. Larson. The young man suggested that the action of the musical should take place against a background of poverty of passionate life of gays, transvestites and Manhattan punks, who did not have their own home. Also to the composer belonged the idea of the playâs name. In 1991, J. Larson decided to start writing the histrionics at his own. He asked permission from B. Aronson to use his concept during the creation of the production. Entered into an agreement to obtain a share of the Broadwayâs income from production, the playwright has given his consent. 

The author has written over a hundred songs, but the musical included only 42 of them. After the preliminary readings, it was revealed that the show required a large enough amount of improvements. Implementing them, J. Larson presented musical in NY Theatre Workshop. On the eve of the first official off-Broadway show, composer was interviewed by A. Tommasini. This journalist from âThe New York Timesâ noted that the beginning of the play coincided with the 100th anniversary of the debut of the opera by Giacomo Puccini. The next morning, Jonathan Larson died. Try-outs were canceled. Instead, friends and relatives of the composer listened to the songs from the musical, performed by actors in loving memory of the deceased author.
