"Side Show" Review - Broadway musical                                  
    Impeccable advantage of this piece is that it is based on a true story that took place in the 1930s. Fiction is a good thing, but it is always interesting to observe the true life of people who, against all odds, managed to succeed in a particular area. In this musical, we are talking about conjoined twins Daisy and Violet Hilton. Starting their artistic career from a low-grade vaudeville, girls managed to get on a serious stage. For long years, they were almost the most popular stars of American pop business.

As planned by Bill Russell, the project supposed to be a play inside the play. It is quite often thing and allows to emphasize the plotâs twists. The musical tells about the artists, most of the scenery made in theater style, the music is fully consistent with the cultural trends of the 30s. Much of the performanceâs success depended on acting of E. Skinner & A. Ripley, who had the honor to bring to the stage The Hilton Sisters. They had to act as a single person, sacrificing personal ambitions. It is logical that one of the actresses could show off acting, and the other could stand out with stronger vocal data. However, this would cause a big contrast and spoil the general idea of the show. Emily & Alice managed to avoid the above-mentioned and on the time of theatricalâs running have become true sisters. The girls have received the only in theatrical history nomination for Best Actress as a duo. 

N. Lewis & J. McCarthy coped well with their roles not worse. Their stage heroes, Terry & Baddy respectively, become the inspirers for twins. They gave them the opportunity to realize their dreams and brought a slice of romanticism in the general line. Overall, the acting is a true biggest item of this production. As for the music, decorations and other â they played a supporting role only, creating a background.
