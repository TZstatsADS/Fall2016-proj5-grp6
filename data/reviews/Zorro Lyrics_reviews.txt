"Zorro" Review - Broadway musical                                  
    The musical is based on the mythical biography of the legendary hero, published by the Chilean writer Isabel Allende in 2005. The book is based on the novel âThe Curse of Capistranoâ. It was written by Johnston McCulley in 1919. The staging was also loosely based on the film of 1998 âThe Mask of Zorroâ. Director Christopher Renshaw began to create a musical several years before the novel by Isabel Allende appeared. The authors gathered in the show episodes from different stories about Zorro and showed their own vision of a mysterious character. The compositions by âGipsy Kingsâ were used as background music, whose members performed flamenco and other Spanish music especially for this play. The histrionics included several well-known hits of this band, the rest of the songs were written specifically. The play used not only fight scenes, but also the tricks: the main character flied through the auditorium on the rope and disappeared mysteriously from his cape in front of the amazed public.
