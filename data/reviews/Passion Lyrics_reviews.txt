"Passion" Review - Broadway musical                                  
    The musical is an adaptation of the film âPassione d'Amoreâ, shot by director E. Scola in 1981. The picture is based on the novel âFoscaâ, written by I. U. Tarchetti. S. Sondheim saw the Italian film in 1983. In the course of viewing, the composer realized that the picture can be musical â songs have already begun to take shape in his mind. He immediately decided that the libretto for the work should write J. Lapine â writer greatly felt different epochs and perfectly transferred their romantic atmosphere onto the scene. Critics were delighted with the staging. But some viewers didnât have serious attitude to this work. During a performance, in a hall resounded laughter, which was very upsetting for the cast and creators. Subsequently, the public attitude towards this theatrical has changed.

Critics noted that the sets for its warm and glowing colors were reminiscent of Italian frescoes. This emphasized the drama of the production. The reviewers highlighted the great emotional and musical passion. Music fully conveyed the atmosphere of love in the play. Many critics felt the play was the best work of Stephen Sondheim at that moment. It was also noted that the actors looked very natural in suits of XIX century, created by A. Hould-Ward.
