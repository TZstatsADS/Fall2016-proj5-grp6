    The musical is an adaptation of the eponymous film, shot by director M. Ritchie in 1975. H. Ashman did not reflect in his work a satirical line of the narration. In his script, he told the story of what was going on behind the scenes during the beauty contest. It lasted for only six weeks on the stage of Broadway. The show was presented to the audience not in the best time, because that year was marked by the appearance of many great musicals. Against their backdrop, this production remained almost unnoticed by the public. Reviews on the Broadway production were mostly negative. Reviewers noted â musical had lost a satirical mood of the film, and despite all efforts, could not recreate a festive atmosphere of the contest. And yet, a few songs from the show received enough fame among the audience. After the failure, the authors engaged in re-thinking of production. They have created more space for male actors, as well as shifted the emphasis on the other womenâs characters of the play. In the future, this show was staged only using the updated version.
