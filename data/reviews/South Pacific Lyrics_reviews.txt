"South Pacific" Review - Broadway musical                                  
    At the heart of the musical is the novel âTales of the South Pacificâ, written by J. A. Michener. In 1947, this book received a Pulitzer Prize. In 1950, the musicalâs script has also been marked with this award. All stories featured in the original book, are real. During World War II, a university lecturer did not use his immunity and went to serve in the US Navy in the Pacific Ocean. Miraculously surviving after the plane crash, J. A. Michener began to pay more attention to the environment. He began to record the stories of sailors and their personal observations. Later the teacher has created a book based on these records. Hammerstein & Rodgers decided to make a new successful musical, as their previous variant of 1947 has not made much of an impression on the audience. They took from the book of J. A. Michener several stories and adapted them for the stage. The unifying factor was the theme of love and racial prejudice. Rodgers did not want to use ordinary music instruments, which usually appeared in every show about the Pacific Ocean. Writer reassured composer, saying that an empty barrel used as a drum was the only music instrument he had seen during the WWII. Having received lyrics from Hammerstein, Rodgers quickly composed the music â it took no more than 20 minutes to create a song sometimes!
