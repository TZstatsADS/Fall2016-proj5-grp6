Soon she realized that the problem was not in the sick mind, but suffering soul. Only she could ease the torments that plagued her for years from inside. This was the reason for leaving the women from the family. Only this way Diana could deal with her mental wounds. After wife left, Dan suddenly realized that he did not deal up with his son's death also. The pain of loss was still felt in the father's heart. Only the man did not realize it fully because he was always busy taking care of his wife. 

Musical raises very important themes of love, patience and understanding. It seems that on the stage are ordinary people â so qualitatively actors transformed into their characters. During the performance, they make the audience experience the full range of feelings and emotions. Clear voices of performers further immerse the viewer in the action of this production. The fate of the sick woman and her family is truly strong. A similar story could happen in any part of our planet. That is why a musical experienced success in the 20 countries of the world. This story is very humane but heavy for unprepared mind, extra-gloomy. Empathy to protagonist of the play helps the viewer to look deep inside self.
