"LoveMusik" Review - Broadway musical                                  
    Alfred Uhry decided to write the script for the musical after reading the correspondence of the famous composer and his wife. Thanks to this, the audience has witnessed feelings that reigned in the inner world of these creative people. History of Kurt Weill and Lotte Lenya is told to the public through the songs, which he wrote at different times. The fate of Lotte & her husband had many tragedies, but also they experienced the joyful moments. The main one among them in the fate of the characters is a meeting on the lake, after which the young people have decided not to separate. 

Got married, they survived times of fame & faced with the looming nightmare of Nazism. Composer reflected the feelings at certain points in their lives via songs. This allowed Uhry not bind the pieces of music in the plot to the actual chronology of their creation. In the narration, the author chose the songs that he believes were most fully expressing feelings of Kurt & his wife in every period of time. The yearning for better times could be heard in the voices of the performers when their heroes faced with the harsh reality â the Second World War. Becoming refugees, they realized that they would never return to their home country again. Married in the USA for the second time, spouses again tried to find their own happiness. The composer succeeded, but not his wife. 

Lenya survived many difficult moments. In spite of past suffering, the strongest hit was the death of her beloved husband. Although their marriage had an open character, she couldnât stand such a loss. Not withstanding the harshness, a woman was ready to break down, but a loyal friend came to her aid. George Davis gave Lenya purpose in life and later became her second husband, despite his gender world outlook.
