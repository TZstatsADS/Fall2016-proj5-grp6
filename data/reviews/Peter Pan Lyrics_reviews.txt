"Peter Pan" Review - Broadway musical                                  
    At the heart of a musical is adaptation of the play âPeter Panâ, created by J. M. Barrie in 1904. The script also took into account the novel âPeter and Wendyâ, which was written by the writer in 1911. The Broadway production in 1954 was completed earlier than planned by its creators only after 152 performances. NBC Channel funded the musical, and its creators intended to show the play live on television. The color broadcast of production was watched by about 65 millions of Americans. But till our time have survived only black-and-white records of this creation. Almost always the role of Peter was played by women. The only exception was a one-time replacement of the actress C. d'Amboise by her understudy â J. Noseworthy. Olympic gymnast Cathy Rigby played a boy who did not want to grow up, for 22 years. It first appeared on stage in a production of 1990. Film version of the play with recently deceased Robin Williams was another exception and the next film of 2015 with famous Hue Jackman named âHookâ was yet another exception. 

This musical is one of the most loved shows in the USA. A thrilling story of the lost boys and their adventures in a fantastic country experiences great popularity among the audience. The first staging received good reviews from critics. Subsequent versions of the musical have also made a positive impression on the audience and reviewers. Many of them said that the choreography of Patti Colombo is different with special vividness and originality. Due to changes in policy towards the indigenous peoples of America in modern times, the musical is an object to change. Song of the Indians, which was present in the original production, insulted the people of this race; therefore, it is changed on the new version. 

Broadway production of 1954 was three times awarded with Tony. The show in 1979 was nominated for Drama Desk (1) and Tony (2). Version of 1990 has been twice nominated for Tony Award. Musical of 1998 was noted with Outer Critics Circle Award. It also received a nomination for Tony. Box office in the last weekend of the show were: for the production of 1990 â 426 694 dollars; for the version of 1998 â 788 907 dollars; the production of 1999 â 572 314 dollars.
