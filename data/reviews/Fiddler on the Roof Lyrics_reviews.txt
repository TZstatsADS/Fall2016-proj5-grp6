"Fiddler on the Roof" Review - Broadway musical                                  
    This musical has a lot of interesting stuff in technical indicators. First of all, it is among the top ten musicals on both main stages of the world, Broadway and West End, showing a huge number (3400+ and 2000+ respectively). That's not counting its resurrections. Apart from that, it possesses a bunch of awards and nominations: 1965 (Tony â 9 wins & 1 nomination); 1972 (Tony â 1 win); 1981 (Tony â 1 nomination); 1990 (Tony â 1 win & 1 nomination); 2004 (Tony â 6 nominations; Drama Desk â 3 nominations); 2008 (2 Laurence Olivier nominations). Taken together, they summarize 25 awards & nominations. To put it mildly, very not bad. The musical also visited various places in the international arena â Australia, Europe (Germany, Tokyo, Israel, France, Spain), Africa, both Americas etc.

Like many popular musicals, it has a lot of amateur productions. If we talk only about the reliably known and only in USA, there is information about 500+ shows. The film of 1971 became the biggest box office success of this year & was nominated at 8 Oscars, winning 3. It eventually became so popular that it has created own halo, from which, like the rays, came references to other areas of life, so it entered the pop-culture, becoming part of life and of elementary knowledge about the world. Even parodies were produced on it, that donât normally happens to musicals. Such eminent personalities as Howard Lovecraft in his work Shoggoth on the Roof parodied it. And a fantastically funny and lovely film Mrs. Doubtfire, where now gone from us Robin Williams performed one of his most prominent roles, parodied a Matchmaker character, which was among the characters of a village, wooing the eldest daughter of the milkman with the wealthy widowed butcher.
