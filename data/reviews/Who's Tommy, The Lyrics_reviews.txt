    At the heart of the theatrical is rock opera âTommyâ, represented by âThe Whoâ music band in 1969. Pete Townshend originally inclined to create compositions, united by a common plot. After the publication of his autobiography, he decided to start writing a rock opera. In the story about a boy, who became blind & deaf-mute due to trauma, many facts from the personal life of guitarist from âThe Whoâ were mentioned. Townshend asked bassist J. Entwistle to compose songs of child abuse, as he found it hard for him to write about this issue. When finished compositions were listened by critic Nik Cohn, he was not impressed with the quality of the material. When Pete Townshend found out that this critic was a fan of pinball & so he entered this game in the act & wrote a song about it. Later this song became a hit. Critics have called this rock opera one of the most daring albums of its time. âTommyâ was the most commercially successful project of âThe Whoâ band. In total, they sold nearly 20 million copies of it.

A dynamic production never made the audience get bored while watching. The sound level was softened comparing with concerts of âThe Whoâ â it allowed the public to perceive lyrics without the auditory overload. The plot of the musical was different from the movie. In the show, the same as in the original rock opera, a crime commits not a lover, but the boy's father. Taking into account the family values of the 1990s, the finale of the play was done more optimistic. The unusual scenography by J. Arnone helped to convey to the audience the state of mind of the protagonist of the play in the best way. The dramatic show did not leave anyone indifferent. Musical encourages people to pay more attention to their surroundings & family, to try to change them for the better.
